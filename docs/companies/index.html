<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by  a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

					 Decentralized Identity opens the doors for safe travel and tourism 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Learn how Indicio and SITA worked together using privacy-preserving technology to reshape contactless health information sharing.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Proof of testing or vaccination has become central to how we reopen travel to countries, admit visitors, and bring tourism economies back to life. Providing privacy and control for people is the key to establishing public confidence in a system for proving one’s health status.</p>
<p>A digital proof of a Covid negative test or vaccination must be designed to protect individual privacy. It should enable a medical or test center to directly provide that information to an individual—and involve no one else storing or managing their data. It should be tamper proof and incapable of being faked. And it should be easy to download and quick to use.</p>
<p>This is why Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation that provides decentralized identity software solutions, and SITA, the leading global technology provider for the air transport industry, have used open source, privacy-by-design technology to build a solution that allows airports, airlines, and all elements of the tourist economy to use verifiable digital credentials to safely and securely return to life.</p>
<p>How to reopen travel and tourism and preserve privacy<br>Decentralized identity uses distributed ledger technology, cryptography, and a new way to provide an individual with control of their digital information. This means identity credentials that contain health information are issued directly to that person’s digital wallet, without any handoff to or management by third-parties. Trusted organizations can quickly issue millions of credentials without any of the information they contain being collected and stored in a third-party database.</p>
<p>Then, when the person decides they want&nbsp; to share all or just part of the information, such as the specific details of their test status, the authenticity and original source of that information can be definitively proven. This makes the digital credential compliant with health and data privacy law (HIPAA, GDPR).</p>
<p>The advantages of this decentralized identity ecosystem are that it can:</p>
 
 Replace paper cards with fully digitized identity information 
 Increase efficiency by automating many tasks involved in presenting personal&nbsp; health status 
 Ensure consent and control when sharing personal data 
 Allow a user to select which information they want to disclose while obscuring the rest 
 Enhance security through privacy-by-design, user-friendly digital records, and tamper-evident distributed ledger technology 
 Avoid the problem of fraudulent health cards or paper forms from being presented 
 Scale to include millions of participants, including employees, travelers, and residents, with just a few writes to a public ledger and an inexpensive mobile application 
 Speed recovery of reopening venues and countries 
 
<p>Open and manage public spaces<br>Indicio’s identity ecosystem is built using Cardea, a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Based onHyperledger Indy and Aries open source technology, its flexible design means it can be easily adapted and deployed by any company, government, or organization that needs a privacy preserving digital credential for managing access.</p>
<p>Indicio’s implementation of Cardea for SITA and the Government of Aruba features a mobile interface in the form of a mobile app for users and a second mobile app for use by venues to receive and verify credentials from users. Software called mediator agents and enterprise agents allow for scaling and automation of the credential issuing and verification processes. Distributed ledger technology provides cryptographic assurance that the data within any given credential has not been tampered with or altered.</p>
<p>Cardea’s architecture protects privacy and aids compliance by separating issuers, holders, and verifiers of credentials. Issuers cannot know where credentials were used by those holding them, and verifiers (receivers) of credentials are able to limit the amount of data they receive and retain.</p>
<p>Successful test deployment in Aruba<br>The island of Aruba and global air transport technology provider SITA came to Indicio to create a trusted traveler system that makes it easy for visitors to share their health status privately and securely using their mobile device.</p>
<p>Aruba is focused on finding innovative ways to strengthen its tourism industry while minimizing the risk of Covid-19 infection from visitors. Unlike immunity passports, the verifiable digital credential system from Indicio allows visitors to share a trusted proof of their health status. This trust is possible because the traveler has shared their health status and had it verified by a public health agency.</p>
<p>Once a test result is approved, the traveler is issued a second credential by the public health agency to confirm that they have tested negative. This credential contains no medical data whatsoever and is used only to prove the person’s test status. The Happy Traveler Card, as this credential is called in Aruba, is verified by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that the traveler visits. It is an easy way for even their smallest businesses to ensure the safety and health of their guests.<br></p>
 The Happy Traveler Card in action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine readable governance enabled businesses and venues to trust that tourists had been tested on arrival by Aruba’s health department. Visitors using the digital Aruba Happy Traveler Card could be swiftly and reliably verified with a phone app. This freed both businesses and the government from the burden of mechanically collecting data with the attendant risk of error or fraud.</p>
<p>The Cardea ecosystem enables Aruba to move toward a privacy-first approach to supporting their tourism industry, which in 2019 accounted for 98.3% of Aruba’s GDP and supported 47,000 jobs—99% of all employment on the island.</p>
<p>Build on our experience for your solution<br>The tourism and hospitality identity solution for SITA is highly replicable for use cases in any industry and easy to integrate with existing systems. With a professionally staffed global network for verifiable digital credentials supported by many of the leading companies in this space, Indicio is building the future of identity. Open source and interoperable software means your solution is scalable and&nbsp; sustainable. Our expert team of architects and engineers can create and customize a solution quickly for business, governments, and organizations who need a privacy-first identity solution and they can deploy it in weeks.</p>

The Support Centre for Data Sharing (SCDS) initiative focuses on researching, documenting, and reporting about the data sharing practices, EU legal frameworks, access and distribution technology that are relevant to organisations, and that imply novel models, and legal or technological challenges.




 





<blockquote>“Whilst privacy is paramount, you can’t have a digital economy if everyone is locking&nbsp;their entire digital footprint away”<p></p>Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder Meeco</blockquote>





 




This is one of the many topics touched on the latest Support Centre for Data Sharing interview. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayweyzen/?originalSubdomain=nl">Raymonde Weyzen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/estherhuyer/?locale=en_US">Esther Huyer </a>interview Meecos’ CEO &amp; Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a> and Chief Commercial Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase">Jason </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase">Smith</a>.




 




Some of the challenges that come with data sharing are data privacy and data control. However the paradox of data sharing is that it generally means the recipient needs the data in order to fulfil an obligation, such as deliver a service, validate identity, deliver a package or customise an experience. <br><br>So the issues are often not about sharing, but about trust and transparency. Helping customers understand why the data is required and providing evidence that it is being used as intended is a great way to establish trust. Another way to boost trust is to focus on designing services that minimise the amount of data collected whilst maximising the value created.





When designing data sharing services, consider how to minimise collection whilst delivering maximum value. It might be as simple as only holding the data for the maximum time needed to complete the service and then sharing evidence that it has been deleted.






 




In this thought provoking interview Raymonde asks about Meeco’s inception, its work so far and recent growth. Some of the the exciting projects discussed include <a href="https://miks-it.com/">mIKs-it, the safe multimedia app for children</a>, developing a decentralised identity and verifiable credentials wallet and how innovators like <a href="https://vela.solutions/">VELA Solutions</a> are transforming workforce management and <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com/">My Life Capsule</a> are helping their customers be prepared for a family emergency.



Other questions and topics covered include:




 




+ How the idea of Meeco was conceived




 




+ Why is there a need for data sharing?




 




+ What is the data sharing lifecycle at Meeco?




 




+ Examples of use cases at Meeco




 




+ What specific licensing or standards to share data are used at Meeco?




 




+ In order to share data proper;y going forward, do we need more or less regulation?




 




+ Where would you see Meeco and ultimately the digital world in 10 years from now?




 




And finally, the most difficult question we weren’t prepared for “What would be the working title of a movie starring Meeco?” to find the answer to this and more click below to listen or watch the interview.

<p>Google has&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announced</a>&nbsp;plans to introduce a “safety section” in the Google Play store to help people understand how Android apps, including its own, use the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;they collect about their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this sounds like Google’s answer to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>, introduced in December 2020, it is —&nbsp;kind of.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">Critics</a>&nbsp;say Google’s new feature isn’t a privacy move so much as a justification for why a user can trust an app with their data. As Google puts it, the new section “will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s not really saying apps shouldn’t collect the data in the first place — which is increasingly Apple’s position, particularly with its new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature.</p>



<p>So what can we expect from the Google Play store safety section?&nbsp;At a glance, app developers will be asked to declare:</p>



  What personal data they collect, including users’ names and email addresses, and any information from the device, such as location data, contacts and photos and videos&nbsp;  What they’re using that personal data for — is it for a better user experience or personalized ads, for example?&nbsp;  Any good security and privacy practices they already have in place, such as data encryption or protecting children under Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families">Families policy</a>  Whether the app needs the data it collects to function or whether users have a choice about their data being shared (as they do on iOS apps through Apple’s new ATT)&nbsp;  Whether the app’s safety section is verified by an independent third&nbsp;party  Whether they will service the user’s right to data deletion requests if the user chooses to uninstall the app.&nbsp;  



<p>As we said, Google’s safety section and Apple’s privacy labels are not really a case of comparing apples with apples (pardon the pun). Critics are&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">saying</a>&nbsp;Apple privacy labels focus on the data apps are collecting for tracking purposes and what’s linked to the end user, whereas Google’s safety section is more about an app’s best practices and trustworthiness in collecting and handling a user’s personal data. While the independent verification on the Google labelling doesn’t happen on Apple’s privacy labelling, it is optional, and it also remains to be seen how rigorous it will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, this is all part of Google’s predictable misunderstanding of what safety means to many people. Yes, it’s about security of data, but Google’s repeated ploy to bait-and-switch a privacy concern into a security solution is missing a big aspect – what companies do themselves and how they share our personal data with other parties. No amount of security-only thinking results in a privacy solution in this case. What’s more, Google going on about the evils of data sharing are moot since they are the biggest data hoarder there is.</p>



<p>Like Apple did when it announced the ATT feature, Google is giving developers plenty of time to get used to the idea. The safety section in Google Play store won’t become mandatory for all apps until Q2 of 2022. In fact,&nbsp;this feels like Google is giving its app developer community longer than Apple did from announcement to required implementation. Perhaps that’s an indirect acknowledgement by Google that the data handling practices of its huge app dev community needs more time?</p>



<p>Once the requirements are mandatory, app developers who don’t comply will face sanctions.</p>



<p>Like all the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-will-adtech-face-google-apple-privacy-changes/">privacy changes we’re seeing in the ad tech space</a>&nbsp;lately, consumers will ultimately determine whether this new move from Google goes far enough in protecting their personal data. As iOS apps have seen with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/only-5-of-us-consumers-want-to-be-tracked-for-ads/">low opt-in rates for cross-app tracking</a>&nbsp;from Apple’s new ATT, Android apps might be in for a rude shock.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, June 23rd 2021, IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service provider for identity verification, announces the launch of AML-compliant video identifications around the clock. Users can now perform non-automated identity verification procedures at any time thanks to the overnight operation.</p>
<p>“With the extended service hours with 24-hour availability, we give our users even more freedom and enable our business customers with tailored support even better accessibility, higher customer satisfaction and of course the possibility to identify more customers per day” says Bettina Pauck, COO of IDnow. “No matter what industry you are in or what your use case is – opening a bank account, foreign exchange trading or player verification, we are here for you.”</p>
<p>The new service offering, which is available in English and German, completes IDnow’s strategy of focusing on the user needs and providing an easy and quick identification – whenever and wherever a customer wants. “For a convenient process that fits into the fast-paced, digital-centric everyday life of users, such a factor is essential,” adds Bettina Pauck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, IDnow offers a highly secure and reliable structure – with a diversification to a total of 20 geographically distributed ident center locations. The sites are located in various cities across Germany and Europe and also guarantee a high level of data protection. The highly qualified and multilingual fraud and identification specialists, who can also offer the service in French, Italian and Spanish, are trained on the comprehensive BaFin process, know the data protection regulations as well as the common forgery and fraud possibilities.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers of online and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

   FastAPI is really fast and SQLAlchemy is really…SQL-y. But what good is a fast and SQL-y application if it isn’t secure? 

 In this post, we’re going to show you how to secure a fast and SQL-y app! 

 First we will need some authentication, which is how we identify
who the user is. We’ll use Okta for this.

<p>First we will need some authentication, which is how we identify

 Bear Management Service Architecture 

<p>What, you expected TodoMVC?</p>

<p>Our app allows authenticated users to register their own bears and view the bear population at large. It consists of two separate services: (1) a front end through which users authenticate with Okta, and (2) a back end that exposes an extensive API for creating and retrieving bears.</p>

 Set Up Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once your new Okta application is created, the Okta CLI will print out its <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> properties:</p>

   <code>$ okta apps create

...

Okta application configuration:
Client Id:     &lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
Issuer:        https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>Create a file named <code>.env</code> in the project’s root directory with the following contents:</p>

   <code>CLIENT_ID=&lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
ISSUER=https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
AUDIENCE=api://default
</code>   

<p>After creating the <code>.env</code> file in the project root, symlink it into the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> subdirectory so that both the front end and back end projects have access to the same configuration parameters:</p>

   <code>$ ln -s ../.env okta-hosted-login/.env
</code>   

 Start the React Front End 

<p>In the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> directory, run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies and then <code>npm start</code> to fire up the React front end.</p>

<p>Once the app is up and running, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your browser. Click the <code>Login</code> button and enter your Okta credentials when prompted. Successfully signing in should redirect you back to your front end, where you’ll be greeted with your name (courtesy of Okta), a ‘Create a new bear’ form, and a list of bears:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The list will be empty because our back end service isn’t running. Let’s change that now.</p>

 Start the FastAPI Back End 

<p>While the React app runs happily in the background, open a new terminal and <code>cd</code> to the project’s root directory. In the root, create and activate a new virtual environment, and then install dependencies:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv venv &amp;&amp; source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Finally, start the FastAPI server:</p>

   <code>uvicorn app.main:app --reload --reload-dir=app
</code>   

<p>If you reload <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, you should see the list of bears populated with a number of very good bears owned by various members of Example.com, Inc:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and create a few new bears of your own.</p>

<p>Our app is now open for business. In fact, it’s  too open. Every authenticated user can see everyone’s bears — even users who have been banned for trying to create koalas. It’s time to put a stop to this madness.</p>

 ABAC, As Easy as 1-2-3 🕺 

<p>Oso is an <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso">open source</a>
authorization system that we’ll use to secure our app. Oso is flexible enough to support <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/examples.html">any access control pattern your heart desires</a>, but for this example we’ll focus on <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/abac.html">attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a>.</p>

<p>ABAC is all about representing fine-grained or dynamic permissions based on who the user is and their relation to the resource they want to access.</p>

 The Bear Necessities 

<p>First, after pressing Ctrl+C to exit FastAPI, we’re going to install the <code>oso</code> and <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> packages:</p>

   <code>pip3 install oso sqlalchemy-oso
</code>   

<p>Once pip finishes pipping, open up <code>app/main.py</code> using your favorite text editor and make the changes that you see below. The following is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">Git diff</a> of the change — if you’re following along, add the lines that start with a single <code>+</code> symbol to your local copy of <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Next, create an empty Oso policy file in the <code>app</code> directory:</p>

   <code>touch app/policy.polar
</code>   

<p>This is where we are going to write all of our authorization logic
using Oso’s declarative policy language called Polar.</p>

<p>Before we start filling that policy file with authorization rules, we first need to register the application data types that we’re going to use in our authorization policy with Oso. Registering the application types allows us to reference them in our Polar policy as <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/polar/polar-syntax.html#specialization">specializers</a>.</p>

<p>We’re going to use the <code>register_models()</code> helper from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library to register our SQLAlchemy models with Oso in bulk. <code>register_models()</code>
registers all descendants of a SQLAlchemy base class with Oso; otherwise, we would have to call <code>oso.register_class()</code> for each individual class that we wanted to register:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Oso is deny-by-default, and we currently have an empty policy file. In the next section, we’ll write our first authorization rule to allow real bear lovers to create real bears.</p>

 Add Your First <code>allow()</code> Rule 

<p>For our first foray into writing a policy, we’re going to use Polar to add a rule that prevents banned users from creating new bears.</p>

<p>Open up <code>app/policy.polar</code> and add the following rule:</p>

 <code>allow(user: User, "create", _bear: BearBase) if
    not user.is_banned;
</code> 

<p>The rule works by matching the inputs provided by the application:</p>

 
   <code>user</code> - an instance of the <code>User</code> class. 
   The action is the string literal <code>"create"</code>. 
   <code>_bear</code> - an instance of the <code>BearBase</code> class. 
 

<p>And then checking that the provided user’s <code>is_banned</code> field is false.
We don’t yet need to check anything further about the <code>bear</code> resource,
so we prefix it with an underscore to indicate that it won’t be referenced in the body of the rule.</p>

<p>NOTE: To learn more about Polar syntax, head on over to <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/learn/policies.html">the Writing Policies guide</a> in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Save the file, flip back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should once again be able to create new bears (assuming you haven’t set your own user’s <code>is_banned</code> property to <code>True</code>). All law-abiding bear enthusiasts have had their access restored, and the koala lovers are left out in the cold. (Does it get cold in Australia? We’ll investigate in a future blog.)</p>

 Deal with List Endpoints 

<p><code>oso.is_allowed()</code> worked perfectly for securing the <code>create()</code> endpoint, but it’s not the best tool for the job when it comes to securing <code>index()</code>. The difference is that <code>create()</code> operates over a single record, while <code>index()</code> operates over a potentially very large collection. If performance weren’t an issue, we could load the collection from the database and iterate over it,
calling <code>oso.is_allowed()</code> on every record to filter out unauthorized entries. However, we all know that Zoomers lose interest and click away from your website if it takes longer than a few Planck time units to load, so we need a better solution.</p>

<p>And now, presenting… a better solution. Data filtering! The cure to all of life’s performance issues.</p>

<p>The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library is built on top of Oso’s data filtering feature. In a nutshell, the logic engine at the core of the Oso library can turn your authorization policy into a set of constraints similar to the <code>WHERE</code> clauses used to filter records when querying a relational database. The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library then applies those constraints directly to your app’s SQLAlchemy queries. In this way, only authorized records are loaded from the database in an efficient operation instead of loading all records and then iterating over the collection to determine the authorized subset.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s wire up our app so that we can efficiently filter some bears.</p>

<p>First, we need to modify <code>app/main.py</code> to import <code>authorized_sessionmaker()</code> from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>
library:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index f2a17d0..1fa9573 100644
--- a/app/main.py
+++ b/app/main.py
@@ -9 +9 @@ from oso import Oso
-from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models
+from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models, authorized_sessionmaker
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll create a new <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/">FastAPI dependable</a> that mirrors our existing <code>get_db()</code> function but yields an Oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/api/sqlalchemy.html#sqlalchemy_oso.session.AuthorizedSession">AuthorizedSession</a> instead of a regular SQLAlchemy <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session">Session</a>. To do this, add the following code below the <code>get_db()</code> function in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and… no bears. They’re still happily growling away in the database, but we haven’t added any Oso rules permitting access. Let’s change that.</p>

 Flesh Out Your Authorization Policy 

<p>To start off, let’s add a rule to <code>app/policy.polar</code> that permits all users to list all bears:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
</code> 

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should see every bear again. But something else is missing. The <code>Owner</code> column is empty! When we serialize bear records in the back end, we include the email address for each bear’s owner — a piece of data that comes from our SQLAlchemy-backed <code>User</code> model. Access to <code>User</code> data is now protected by Oso because <code>User</code> is a subclass of the <code>Base</code> SQLAlchemy class we registered via <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <code>register_models()</code> method. Let’s add one more blanket <code>allow()</code> rule, this time permitting users to view user data at the <code>index()</code> endpoint:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: User);
</code> 

<p>Do the save-and-reload dance, and the <code>Owner</code> column should once again be populated.</p>

<p>Next, let’s add some constraints to our <code>"index"</code> rule for bears so we can see Data Filtering in Action (coming soon from Manning, probably).</p>

<p>Perhaps users should only be allowed to see their own bears:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar
index ff90780..0a1a77d 100644

-allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);

</code>   

<p>Save, reload, and confirm you can no longer see anyone else’s bears. If you want to see some bears, you’ll need to create them for yourself.</p>

<p>The index view is now private, but it feels wrong to prevent our fellow bear enthusiasts from viewing polar bears, the sweetest and most mild-mannered of all bears. To right that wrong, we can register the <code>Species</code> enum as a constant so that we can reference it in our policy:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py

 Learn More About Oso, FastAPI, and Python 

<p>In this post, we started out with a very fast and SQL-y application built on FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. We created and configured a new Okta application to handle identity management and authentication for our app. Then we used Oso to add efficient, fine-grained authorization to our back end API.</p>

<p>The full example is available on <a href="https://github.com/osohq/fastapi-sqlalchemy-okta-oso-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re up for it, here are a couple exercises to try:</p>

 
   Add roles to the app using <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/getting-started/roles/builtin_roles.html">built-in roles</a> feature.
Perhaps every bear lives in a sanctuary, and a user can have a particular
role in each sanctuary, e.g., “Visitor”, “Friend”, or “Shepherd”. 
   Add a “Delete” button next to every bear in the list, and wire up each button to send
a DELETE request to the back end. Secure your new <code>delete()</code> handler with
Oso, and add a rule to the policy that only allows users to delete their own
bears. 
   Join <a href="https://join-slack.osohq.com">our slack</a> and let us know what your favorite bear is and why
it’s the polar bear. 
   Learn more about other use cases of Oso, other languages it supports,
and more in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.

Immutable, Trustless And Immune To Fraud: The Blockchain Expansion Of Democratic Republicanism<p>Introduction: The Great Fraud: Blockchain’s Rectification</p>Can We Trust Traditional Paradigms Of Ballot Counting For Fair And Equitable Elections Without Blockchain?<p>It has become evident that democratic-republicanism is under-threat by tyranny, despotism and elusive election tampering. Throughout the globe, voter fraud has become a prevalent topic of discussion from major political entities to the citizenry; ballots don’t make results, the counters do. The last three elections within the United States have succumbed to political parties accusing one another of voter fraud, through substantiated and unsubstantiated claims; how can we rectify such a broken paradigm that threatens republicanism, blockchain is the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Blockchain technology is an immutable system that is immune to fraud and provides users with an innovation that is highly secured, decentralized and anonymized with audible chains of records. Blockchain technology has revolutionized and transformed numerous different industries which include supply-chains, escrow, invoices, healthcare, crowdfunding and cloud storages etc. and now it is time for blockchain to perpetuate the ethos of democracy as the catalyst of the demise of voter fraud. Blockchain in its purest of forms and most simplistic of terms is a digital ledger that is peer-to-peer that mitigates the avaristic intent of centralized entities. Encryption makes these records incorruptible and easy to verify. Voters can utilize blockchain and can be assured that their vote will not be tampered with and simultaneously, their vote stays anonymous; this is the true ethos and incorruptible paradigm of voting that should become the foundational bedrock of republicanism. This dynamic change in transparency surrounding voting is incumbent for democracy to expand and flourish into the 21st century, especially with ongoing investigations surrounding voter-fraud, not just in the United States, but throughout the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Aergo’s Understanding And Desire To Decimate Voter Fraud: The Pikkle Construction</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Voting Mechanism On The Aergo Platform: Enhancing Global Participation Of Transparent Blockchain Voting<p>Pikkle is the first of its kind; built on the Aergo platform by Blocko, Aergo’s technology partner and utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, Pikkle aims to resolve a variety of dilemma’s that plague traditional voting paradigms and mechanisms. Pikkle resolves issues such as cost inefficiencies, resolving voter processes that creates substantial costs that coincide with targeting voters, identity verification, ballot counts and check lists. Pikkle aims to mend the public trust of voting paradigms which, throughout the world, many voters have lost confidence in voting mechanisms because of the continuous onslaught and investigations of voter fraud. Pikkle ensures that trust is consolidated back into the consciousness of the populace; unfortunately, since the advent of social media, it has become evident that votes can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platforms own self-interest. We saw this occur consistently among some of the most prominent social media platforms during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections within the United States. With voter fraud corrupting democracy, one must ask, are we in a democracy, or a democracy masked by corruptible despotism; it is not power that corrupts, but it is magnetic to the corruptible and Pikkle aims to change this&nbsp;notion.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association aims to utilize Pikkle as the standardized go-to platform for reliable voting services for all users involved. Pikkle collects users information and views and assists in decision making through an application service rather than traditional cold-calling and text voting spams. Pikkle resolves voter fraud by storing data-components of voters such as identification of voters and voting results utilizing blockchain technology; an immutable digital ledger that cannot be hacked, tampered with or corrupted, unlike traditional voting systems. Convenience has become a crucial component of almost every single part of our daily lives so Pikkle encourages the seamless usage of QR codes to participate in voting actions, insured by the public and private trust of blockchain technology. Centralized entities have attempted to garner similar approaches, but since the public trust in these entities has waned over the last fifteen years, it is evident that an app like Pikkle can replace traditional voting mechanisms. Through the utilization of blockchain technology, stake-holders, companies, governmental organizations, criminal enterprises and political parties can no-longer shake the foundational bedrock of pure democracy, and Pikkle emphasizes and embodies such a notion. The app’s identity verification service, which eliminates the need for a physical ticket, enables efficient and easy entry into cultural events and festivals, a hallmark of South Korean tradition. Fun fact, the word Pikkle derives itself from two words “pick” and “people”, the people pick the electoral incumbents, not the despots and politicians.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association: Blocko And Aergo: Unified Under The Consciousness Of Mending Public Voter&nbsp;Trust</p>Mending Public Trust Through Blockchain Voting Platforms: The Pikkle&nbsp;Paradigm<p>On April 23rd, The Korean Broadcasters Association, Blocko and Aergo signed an MOU to ensure the practical application and construction of a blockchain based audience participation application and voting system. The Korean Broadcasters Association is an organization that is almost half a century old with an aim to unify South Korea through domestic terrestrial broadcasts. The Korean Broadcasters Association has worked with the largest broadcasting stations in all of South Korea which include joint ventures when counting exit polls alongside the KBS, MBC and SBS. Through offering various cooperation to provide the 40 members with high quality and diverse broadcasting services, the KBA is continuously trying its best. The KBA intends on utilizing Pikkle for a variety of services which include, but are not limited to, media content and voting systems to select winners for Korea Broadcasting Prizes and the Seoul International Drama Awards on the Aergo platform. Blocko also plays a crucial role in the development and expansion of Pikkle as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Blocko is Aergo’s main technology partner that was established in 2014 and has worked with some of the largest institutions in all of South Korea which include the Bank of Korea, Financial Security Agency, Shinhan Financial Group, Hyundai Motor Group and many more. It is incumbent to reference that Blocko is South Korea’s largest blockchain infrastructure provider that has built blockchain based services for financial, political and public institutions throughout the nation. Blocko has commercialized enterprise blockchain platforms based off of Aergo, an open-sourced hybrid blockchain protocol powered by the native cryptocurrency AERGO optimized for hybrid deployments for public and private institutions.</p><p>Conclusion: Mending Democracy: The Pikkle Mission Confirmed</p>Pikkle Aims To Integrate With Broadcasting Systems And Festivals By Q3 Of This Year And Intends To Launch NFT’s Next&nbsp;Year<p>It is evident that the public trust of traditional voting mechanisms has all but collapsed over the last decade. Aergo comprehended this notion and seeks to rectify public trust themselves through the utilization of Pikkle on a consolidated frontier between Aergo, Blocko and the Korean Broadcasters Association. Pikkle is the first of its kind surrounding blockchain voting, enabling immutable and incorruptible data to be stored on the blockchain which has the ability to rectify our globally broken electoral system. Blockchain technology can transform democracy, and Pikkle can perpetuate its transcendence.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digitized-voting-democratized-the-aergo-blockchain-voting-paradigm-df70da14e2d">Digitized Voting Democratized: The Aergo Blockchain Voting Paradigm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#165 — Everything you need to know about new FTC chief Lina&nbsp;Khan <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-164-what-apples-missing-about-digital-identity-1d587693e285">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool  What people are&nbsp;saying  What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech  Everything Lina Khan + Big&nbsp;Tech  What people think about Big Tech platforms  Chart of the&nbsp;week  BONUS: Every platform is Clubhouse now  Stuff happens   1. The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool Photo: Lexey Swall / linamkhan.com<p>Lina Khan shot to unlikely national recognition after the publication of her seminal work while still at Yale, <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</a>. An overnight sensation, the paper helped reframe decades of consensus around antitrust frameworks — which at the time were formulated around pricing. Instead, we should focus on structural power, Lina&nbsp;argued.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">the NYTimes</a> back in&nbsp;2018:</p><blockquote>Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, [Lina Khan] presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: “The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon’s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.”</blockquote><p>Lina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">at the&nbsp;time</a>:</p><blockquote>“As consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,” she said. “But as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.”</blockquote><p>Thanks to Lina’s paper and her ability to bring newfound attention to an old challenge, new frameworks and vocabularies have been bubbling below the surface over the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>In that time, our stance on Big Tech has rapidly shifted. From being darlings of capitalism and innovation, we now view the corporate titans that control our digital world with a heightened sense of skepticism.</p><p>Our political leaders have taken the hint. The issue of monopoly power is, today, a bipartisan issue — though sometimes for different reasons.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Now, 32, Lina Khan is the new chair of the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-will-chair-federal-trade-commission-c7ea8e06-25de-4d8d-b188-2297169cd3fa.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Khan, an antitrust expert well-known for her ideas for applying competition law to the tech industry, is sure to spook tech platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>Khan, 32 years old, is a hero to critics of tech who want to see the government act more aggressively against what they see as anti-competitive behavior from companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57501579">BBC</a>:</p><blockquote>Worryingly for Big Tech too, a number of bipartisan bills have also been put forward in Congress to rein in the power of Big Tech. That there are Democrats and Republicans who support antitrust action makes her position even more powerful.</blockquote><blockquote>Ms Khan’s appointment is the clearest sign yet that President Biden means business when it comes to clipping the wings of companies like Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><p>Wired in a piece titled, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-finally-moving-at-speed-of-tech/">The US Government Is Finally Moving at the Speed of&nbsp;Tech</a>:</p><blockquote>The result is that we find ourselves living in a world that looks very different from the one we were living in just a few years ago. New antitrust cases against tech giants are popping up left and right, keeping the issue firmly in the public consciousness. The companies are devoting unprecedented sums toward lobbying, advocacy, and advertising to try to avert a crackdown. And in the sharpest break with the past, Congress and the White House are taking concrete steps to restructure markets that have been left to their own devices for two and a half&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s all so much, so fast, that it’s hard to keep track of the various subplots. The introduction of the five House antitrust bills and the elevation of Khan to FTC chair, for example, look like two separate stories. But they’re really two parts of the same story: Khan was herself the key investigator behind the House antitrust subcommittee’s investigation of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, begun in 2019. The bills introduced last week are the fruits of that investigation. (While the time between the start of the investigation and the release of legislative proposals has felt like an eternity to those of us who follow this closely, it wouldn’t be bad for a Silicon Valley product launch. It took Amazon three years to bring the Kindle to&nbsp;market.)</blockquote><p>Matt Stoller, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-antitrust-revolution-has-found">The Antitrust Revolution Has Found Its&nbsp;Leader</a>:</p><blockquote>Khan is something rare in progressive politics, someone with academic credentials and mastery over a dense technical subject, but also connected with a broad-based populist social movement that crosses partisan lines. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken to in business, Republicans as well as Democrats, who talk in reverential tones about Khan. It’s not just that she is an important thinker, it’s that she *understands* what they are going through, the coercive power they are up against. And that’s because she got her start understanding the economy not in a classroom or at a law firm, but as a business journalist, listening to business people and workers facing monopolists.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>To call this appointment remarkable understates the point. That Khan is on the commission, with Republican votes, is surprising enough, but for her to be Chair is downright shocking. It’s too soon to know what Khan is going to do in her new role, but her appointment is already sending shock waves in the enforcement community globally. Antitrust policy is run by a small yet international community of lawyers and economists who know each other. In every country, some of them are cheering this move, while others are horrified. But they all know it matters, because as goes the U.S. on antitrust, so goes&nbsp;Europe.</blockquote> 3. What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech <p>For one, they’re on high alert. Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/big-tech-s-uneasy-future">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>And on Tuesday, tech stocks barely flinched at the news. But Khan’s arrival is likely to put Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft on the defensive in a way the past few years of heated anti-tech rhetoric have&nbsp;not.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s because Khan’s appointment to lead the agency, one of two antitrust enforcers in the U.S. along with the Justice Department, poses perhaps the most serious threat yet. Although she is just one person on a five-member commission, as chair she will set the enforcement and policy priorities for the agency. That could very well mean an antitrust case against Amazon, given her law school paper outlining the antitrust problems with the online retailer. A Khan-led FTC also is likely to bring enforcement actions to rein in not just the technology sector, but corporate America writ&nbsp;large.</blockquote><p>We’ll be watching to see how Lina Khan intends to leverage her new position of power. But it’s worth noting that antitrust is about a lot more than just trust busting — say, forcing Facebook to break up Instagram and WhatsApp. As Greg has mentioned in the past, the cat’s out of the&nbsp;bag.</p><p>Instead, we could see new rules around key issues such as interoperability and portability — <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/privacy/061721-tech-regulatory-overhaul-series-the-excess-of-access/">including this recently introduced bill</a> (via&nbsp;/m):</p><blockquote>This post assesses H.R. 3849, the “Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act of 2021” introduced by Representatives Scanlon (D-PA) and Owens (R-UT). The bill would impose sweeping requirements on specific covered platforms to build new technical interfaces to transfer data to competitors and potential competitors and to enable interoperability between their services.</blockquote><p>Here’s Mitja on the subject, comparing it to when telco companies finally allowed phone number portability:</p><blockquote>This bill might end Facebook’s monopoly, but one of the interesting and important things to note is interoperability which enables users to switch from one social network to&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In this case, “switch” could be defined similarly to when the UsSs government forced wireless companies to let you take your phone number with you when you switch carriers — a similar move may be called on social networks to let you take your identity and social content and transfer it elsewhere.</blockquote><p>With Lina, anything’s on the table. But these are early days and she still has her work cut out for her, as WIRED reminds&nbsp;us:</p><blockquote>None of this is to say that the movement to break up Big Tech, or rein it in, or whichever bumper sticker you prefer, has achieved victory. The legislative agenda in particular remains a long shot until proven otherwise. While it’s noteworthy that the bills have bipartisan support within the House antitrust subcommittee, they might not have enough to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, even in altered form. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has already come out in opposition, and even those Senate Republicans who might be sympathetic have yet to publicly support the agenda. (Even if the bills become law, there’s no guarantee they will achieve the desired results.) Ted Cruz, who appears to revel in browbeating social media executives as much as anyone, voted against Khan’s confirmation. So did Mike Lee, the ranking Republican member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee.</blockquote><blockquote>But even if legislation stalls, Khan’s overwhelming confirmation — she received support from 21 Republican senators — means change is coming to the FTC. Several experts have argued that the agency has enormous, mostly untapped power to structure markets. Two of those experts now make up two-thirds of the commission’s Democratic majority: Khan and her former boss, Rohit Chopra, who last year published an article arguing for the agency to use its authority to issue rules about unfair competition, rather than relying exclusively on litigation. They now have an opportunity to put that theory into practice.</blockquote> 4.

Chart of the&nbsp;week <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-industrys-glory-days-in-washington-are-over-11623936187?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>“In the last four or five years, the pendulum has swung in an overly dramatic fashion from ‘tech can do no wrong’ to ‘tech can do no right,’ ” said Adam Kovacevich, who spent 12 years as one of Google’s top lobbyists. He now leads a new tech group called Chamber of Progress aimed at wooing back Democrats.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>As five House tech bills came together this month, lobbyists for the companies that would be most affected said they were frozen out of the process and that the lawmakers did everything they could to keep drafts of the proposals out of their&nbsp;hands.</blockquote><blockquote>“The industry was very much treated as the enemy, and one to be isolated,” one lobbyist said.

 Encoding Trust that Travels with Data — A New Product Introduction Case Study Powered by Solutions Design with Transmute  This case study describes supply chain innovation work completed by <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a>, <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/">GS1 US</a>, and <a href="https://gs1ca.org/">GS1 Canada</a> and <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a> during the second half of&nbsp;2021. <p>About <a href="http://www.gs1.org">GS1</a>: GS1 is a neutral, not-for-profit organisation that develops and maintains the most widely used global standards for efficient business communication. GS1 is best known for the barcode, named by the BBC as one of “the 50 things that made the world economy”. GS1 standards improve the efficiency, safety and visibility of supply chains across physical and digital channels in 25 sectors. GS1’s scale and reach — local Member Organisations in 115 countries, 2 million user companies and 6 billion transactions every day — help ensure that GS1 standards create a common language that supports systems and processes across the globe. Find out more at <a href="http://www.gs1.org">www.gs1.org</a></p><p>About <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>: Transmute is a US-based technology company that uses next generation identity and credentialing technologies to provide comprehensive solution design and software to define, digitize, and share verifiable data at scale. Transmute partners with innovative enterprises and governments to build digital trust ecosystems where this data can be securely exchanged across diverse stakeholders and technology vendors. Transmute specializes in trusted information about global supply chain products, actors, and transactions.</p> Project Overview <p>In 2021, GS1 and Transmute worked together to test the business and technical feasibility of combining <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 standards</a> with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> for product-related claims.There was mutual interest in moving from theory to practice to illustrate the tangible value of leveraging Verifiable Credentials for creating trust that travels with&nbsp;data.</p><p>This project was guided by these key questions:</p>  How can GS1 create trust that travels with data by issuing authoritative information about companies and products?  How might <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a>, Verifiable Credential, and Decentralized Identifier standards be leveraged together to create business value related to product&nbsp;claims?  <p>Through our collaboration we discovered particular value in the area of new product introduction — or the process of procuring new products as a retailer. As consumers we rarely think about how the things we buy arrived on the physical (or virtual) shelf. Behind the scenes it can take months for retailers and brands to establish relationships, validate products, complete distribution, and ensure quality before making those goods available to consumers. We found multiple opportunities to improve the speed and security of these processes by leveraging Verifiable Credentials in conjunction with GS1 standards and identifiers.</p> Solutions Design Process: GS1 + Transmute Collaboration <p>Our companies worked through a step-wise approach to move from broad theory to a targeted application of our combined technologies for new product introduction.</p><p>Collaborative working sessions including GS1 experts and the Transmute team were conducted over several months to identify the most feasible and impactful possibilities. We drew from the international standards, supply chain, and technical expertise of GS1 team members. Transmute combined this information with our decentralized technologies expertise to propose specific credentials, workflows, and businesses narratives to address the product claims focus. These solutions are technically supported by the Transmute platform and open source libraries.</p><p>Our group went through multiple iterations as a part of early solution design work. This stage includes detailed business narratives for a variety of supply chain use cases, workflow mapping, brand interviews, sample credentials, and early prototypes, culminating in a Solution Design Report. This phase of work ultimately drove the narrowed focus to the new product introduction use case as the highest value opportunity for illustration of immediate industry&nbsp;value.</p><p>Next we built a Proof-of-Concept demonstration — including an interactive prototype and technical libraries — to show how these credentials can be issued, exchanged and verified seamlessly across brands. You can see the prototype in action&nbsp;here:</p> New Product Introduction Description <p>The following written description provides further detail about the business story portrayed in the video above. If you already watched the video you can also jump to the subsequent section.</p><p>Brand Healthy Tots wants to sell its natural baby food products for the first time with retailer Sell Anything &amp; Everything (SA&amp;E). SA&amp;E will start by selling the Healthy Tots product in its online store, with the future possibility of also selling it in brick and mortar locations.</p><p>Typically new product onboarding is a lengthy process, requiring submission of PDF documentation and requesting data from a variety of parties, often leading to duplicated costs and effort. These documents and sites are also very easy to fake, giving false confidence in product&nbsp;claims.</p><p>Healthy Tots provides SA&amp;E with verifiable evidence of its GLN and the product GTINs, and the process kicks off instantly. SA&amp;E uses the <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> resolver to immediately discover locations of all related product information. SA&amp;E’s system can then request relevant information from the associated locations, providing evidence where needed that it is authorized to do so. For example, it is able to request third party issued organic certification, allergen information, and product&nbsp;images.</p><p>SA&amp;E receives this information in the form of Verifiable Credentials signed by the original issuing parties, and is able to confidently populate the new product listing. SA&amp;E can do so automatically because the issuer of the information can be identified and confirmed, allowing data they issue to be passed through relatively unknown or untrusted parties like Healthy Tots systems. The SA&amp;E system can even automatically check that the issuing parties possess appropriate accreditations and/or GLNs to make sure such statements about the product are authoritative. This includes going all the way back to GS1 Global as a root of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Healthy Tots can fill in any additional product details that SA&amp;E needs, and the product can be listed for sale within minutes. Relevant pieces of verifiable information such as certified organic and allergen information can also be passed through to the consumer’s view, providing deeper confidence in the legitimacy of the product and associated accreditations.</p> Testing Business&nbsp;Benefits <p>This novel approach to sharing product data can lead to the following benefits:</p>  Reduced administrative burden and faster timeline from engagement to product on&nbsp;shelves.  Automation for the retailer, working with hundreds or even thousands of vendors and tens of thousands of products. This protects brand reputation and allows elevation to human review when risk is detected.  Unambiguous documentation requirements that meet regulatory needs and further speed up processes.  More broadly, an encoded process for establishing trust in data that persists across systems, data pools, and unknown intermediaries.  <p>One of the next steps for this work is deeper testing of these benefits to measure cost savings, efficiency gains and strategic insight.</p> Building Trusted Ecosystems with&nbsp;GS1 <p>The demo scenario is underpinned by GS1 as a root of trust in the network — continuing a rich history for GS1 in this role. GS1 licenses and identifiers are and will continue to be at the foundation of trusting products and companies. Combining current practices with verifiable credential, decentralized identifier, and <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> standards disambiguating products builds business reputation for just-in-time engagement while keeping information up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>We believe that institutions like GS1 are critical in paving the foundations for trusted data to move across ecosystems in the future. Ultimately, trust has to flow from one or more sources whose reputation allows businesses to act with confidence. The advantage of the approach taken in this POC is that the distance between verifiers and root-of-trust organizations can be much greater without losing confidence in the information being presented. As long as the chain of trust retains integrity, the possibilities are&nbsp;endless.</p> Next Steps <p>This new product introduction demonstration is now being used to test, validate, break, and refine assumptions about how the involved standards and technologies can best be leveraged to generate value for individual businesses and the broader ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“GS1 is moving forward with work to extend existing standards in order to better support the evolving needs of our member companies and create a consistent, common path forward for the scale of digital credentials.” — Melanie Nuce, Senior Vice President, Innovation and Partnerships, GS1&nbsp;US</blockquote><blockquote>“Verifiable Credentials are an exciting opportunity for GS1 to extend its identification system, improve data quality, and secure the supply chain in ways never before possible.” — Kevin Dean, Special Projects Consultant, GS1&nbsp;Canada</blockquote><p>Transmute is working with customers to continue designing, building, and growing digital trust ecosystems — from Solution Design work to bringing businesses onto the Transmute Platform to experience issuance, exchange, and verification of Verifiable Credentials integrated with existing business infrastructure.

 The once fictional concept of a “Metaverse” is fast becoming a reality — and Ontology is set to be an integral part of this evolving ecosystem. <p>The term metaverse combines the prefix “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">meta</a>” (meaning “beyond”) with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe</a>”. The Metaverse refers to a collective, virtual space, encompassing the totality of virtual worlds, augmented realities, and the internet. The concept originates in Snow Crash, a science-fiction novel by Neil Stephenson depicting a futuristic world in which people operate virtual avatars in an online world known as the Metaverse.</p><p>The kind of metaverse imagined by Stephenson is yet to be realized in the real world. However, the building blocks of a potential future Metaverse are already beginning to appear. Considering recent developments in science and technology, we can roughly define the Metaverse as: the next generation internet based on XR (including VR, AR, and MR), computer technology, internet communication technology, and social networks. More broadly, the Metaverse is a virtual reality world representing ‘real’ world experiences, such as working, studying, and investing. Users can transition freely between the offline and online&nbsp;realm.</p><p>A widely accepted definition of the Metaverse comes from Dave Baszucki, CEO of Roblox. He outlines eight characteristics of the Metaverse, which include: identity, friends, immersion, low latency, diversity, anytime and anywhere, economy and civilization. Based on this outline, we explore the contributions Ontology expects to make to the Metaverse of the&nbsp;future.</p> Identity <p>In the era of Big Data, unprecedented amounts of information can be stored and shared. This has enabled the growth of online encyclopedias, video streaming services, and social networks. Such technologies allow information to be accessed globally. But due to their scale, they are vulnerable to attack from bad actors aiming to obtain private information, a commodity that has become increasingly valuable in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Centralized organizations such as Facebook and Google control the identities, data and assets, of their users. The accumulated data are used to create targeted advertising campaigns. Platforms owned by the likes of Facebook are ostensibly free to use, with users sacrificing their privacy for the convenience that comes with using them. Most platforms require users to register a separate account for each platform, meaning each user may operate many accounts simultaneously.</p><p>To return to the concept of a Metaverse, how can we develop a system allowing users to migrate between parts of the Metaverse with a consistent identity, whilst ensuring their data and privacy are respected? Ontology’s “ONT ID”, a decentralized identity (DID) framework, and “OScore”, a self-management scoring system, aim to do just&nbsp;that.</p><p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C decentralized identifier specification, blockchain and cryptography. It can quickly identify and connect people, assets, objects, and events, with the characteristics of decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, security, and usability. In short, ONT ID is not governed by any centralized authority, and allows users to securely manage their identities and data, independently.</p><p>At the same time, Ontology’s DDXF (Distributed Data Exchange Framework), provides a decentralized way to exchange data, which collaborates with ONT ID to improve users’ privacy protection. In addition, OScore generates scores for users based on their on-chain data, which they can authorize third parties to access. Users can also bind their OScore data and off-chain data using ONT ID, in order to seamlessly transition between the on-chain world and the off-chain world.</p><p>ONT ID, DDXF and OScore, are all central features of Ontology’s decentralized solutions, designed to allow users to manage their identity, data and assets, independently, in a decentralized way. Based on the interoperability and verifiability of decentralized identity, our solutions not only solve the pain points of social trust, but also enrich the whole trust ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology’s ONT ID is equipped for the Metaverse of the future, allowing users to easily traverse different environments within the Metaverse, in addition to enabling migration in and out of the virtual world. Whether online or offline, trust is an integral feature of a functioning society. OScore, the credit review system, bolsters trust and reliability when transacting, benefitting both individuals and organizations alike.</p> Economy <p>In the Metaverse economy, users can earn wealth through work, education, investment, and trade. By doing so, the whole ecosystem expands. However, it’s worth noting that this kind of ecosystem is not closed-loop. The Metaverse is not a purely virtual world. It must be closely connected with the real world, in order to realize its potential. Users can earn money not only by working in the real world, but also by playing games in the virtual world. These two kinds of assets are highly liquid and contribute to the overarching ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology is not only engaged in research and technological development. It is also dedicated to launching blockchain-based products that build connections between online and offline ecosystems. In the service sector, Ontology has partnered with<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/on-the-move-new-adoption-of-ontology-in-the-new-energy-logistics-vehicle-industry-9f46c1da0c4"> Kai Yun Delivery</a>, a comprehensive logistics service provider focusing on urban transportation and terminal-end deliveries. Kai Yun provides data attestation solutions, implementing the business scenario of “online consumption + instant delivery”, and empowers the new energy vehicle industry by solving the problem of low efficiency and high cost. In the field of digital assets, Ontology provides technology support for <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/250-million-pieces-of-ogq-digital-asset-content-to-be-housed-on-the-ontology-blockchain-428d385092ba">OGQ</a>, a leading digital assets and content platform in South Korea, helping content creators protect their copyrighted material. In the mobile and travel industry, Ontology and Daimler Mobility AG Blockchain Factory, which was established to bring the benefits of blockchain innovation and application to the automotive finance and mobility industry, jointly developed the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Welcome Home</a>” application. The app integrates cutting-edge technologies such as digital identity to bring a new driving experience to car&nbsp;drivers.</p><p>Finally, in the field of job recruitment, Ontology has successfully integrated its cross-chain wallet, <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, into global freelancing marketplace leader, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-microworkers-partner-to-enhance-global-freelancing-marketplaces-adef34dbe2f9">Microworkers</a>, providing more economic opportunities to freelancers. Based on information such as resume matching and job intention, freelancers establish labor relations with recruiting companies. After they complete the work, companies can compensate freelancers with ONT or other tokens, according to the contract. Candidates can use ONTO to transfer the received digital assets to their wallet address or personal assets terminals. During this process, ONG serves as the gas fee. This is Ontology’s dual token model. Such a model can be applied online and offline, acting as a circular token in the economic system of Metaverse, helping to enrich the ecosystem.</p><p>In addition to the economic and ID-based solutions, mentioned above, the Metaverse can also benefit from blockchain technology on other&nbsp;levels.</p>  Low latency: Relative to the high fees and congestion that has become the norm on Ethereum, the transaction confirmation rate on Ontology is very fast. On Ethereum, the average transaction cost is tens of US dollars, with some transactions costing over $100. However, on the Ontology chain, each transaction only consumes 0.05 ONG (equivalent to $0.05). At the same time, Ontology has been continuously researching the latest Layer 2 technology. Ontology is exploring the possibility of integrating with Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and is committed to overcoming the technical barriers between Ontology and Ethereum. Ontology hopes Ethereum users can enjoy the same high-efficiency and low-fees as Ontology users. This coincides with the low latency attribute of the Metaverse. Whether in the real world or the virtual world, transaction speed greatly affects the user experience.  Diversity: On the Ontology chain, users can create multiple ONT IDs to log in on different terminals, based on their specific needs. For example, you can use different ONT IDs to independently manage ONTO and Wing or, if you prefer, you can use the same ONT ID for both. Whether in real life or in the Metaverse, you can generate multiple identities based on your own needs. The diversity of ONT ID is consistent with the diverse nature of the Metaverse. A variety of identities enrich the virtual world’s ecosystem and greatly enhance the sense of immersion.  Anytime and Anywhere: ONTO is a decentralized identity mobile terminal. It provides an all-in-one service for management of decentralized identities and data. Wherever you are, you can manage your assets, data and identities, in the palm of your hand. This kind of portability is indispensable in the Metaverse.  Civilization: The Metaverse originates in the human imagination. Blockchain is the underlying technology that will enable the Metaverse to become reality. Since its inception, Ontology has been developing blockchain technologies such as DID and data management tools, aiming to contribute to the global advancement of science and technology. At the same time, Ontology also hopes to inspire more people to participate in the blockchain revolution by developing new technologies and fostering a global community.  <p>Ontology is committed to accelerating the arrival of the coming Metaverse via the research and development of blockchain and further upgrades to its decentralized identity and data solutions.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>Organizations around the world have been rapidly modernizing their access management infrastructures in response to increased cyber-attacks and data breaches, enactment of security and privacy regulations, and a shift to remote working.</p>
<p>Access management modernization is quick shift away from insecure passwords, which time and again facilitate criminals to gain access to corporate networks and data. A recent survey on the <a href="https://www.insightsforprofessionals.com/en-us/it/security/the-psychology-of-passwords-neglect-is-helping-hac/download" title="Psychology of Passwords">Psychology of Passwords</a> found that 59% of the respondents use the same password repeatedly, at home and in the office. The main reason behind this dangerous trend is the fear of forgetting the login information.</p>
<p>It is therefore time for businesses to evolve their approach to identity proofing to mitigate the risks of an increasingly remote workforce. As the corporate boundaries disintegrate, organizations require a new defensive playbook to address emerging business risk and remain secure.</p>
 A Zero-Trust approach to risk mitigation 
<p>When the concept of Zero-Trust was first conceived, it was about zero trust networks. However, today and in the future, corporate users and partners are accessing data through a plethora of networks – corporate, private, mobile. Hence, it is not efficient to discuss about securing access networks – it is almost impossible to do so.</p>
<p>The security perimeter of corporate assets had to shift to another frontline. The evolution of Zero-Trust is about securing the access points to apps and data. Since everyone is literally an outsider in cloud environments, there is a need to “never trust, always verify” the identity of the individual or the device requesting access to data and apps.</p>
<p>While Zero-Trust is not a single technology solution, it is the paradigm that can assist businesses support securely requirements for accessing a “constellation” of apps and data from everywhere. By validating the identity of the individual or device at every access point, organizations can mitigate the threats introduced by the proliferation of multi-cloud and hybrid computing environments and secure their digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
 Access management trends towards a Zero-Trust future 
<p>As technology evolves, organizations can evolve their access security to meet the increasing demands of cloud computing and pave their path towards a Zero-Trust culture. Businesses need to be aware of the various emerging trends on access management, evaluate them and tailor them to their business needs.</p>
<p>According to many security experts, the following trends will shape the access management and security ecosystem:</p>
 
 Identity-first security - Now that organizations operate fully (or mostly) remote, this trend has become vital to address. The result of these technical and culture shifts is that “identity first security” now represents the way all information workers will function, regardless of whether they are remote or at their office. 
 Managing machine identities as a critical security capability - As digital transformation progresses, organizations are experiencing increased numbers of non-human entities – containers, apps, services, mobile devices – IoT devices. Managing machine identities has become a vital part of the security strategy. As the number of devices increases, establishing an enterprise-wide strategy for managing machine identities, certificates and secrets will enable the organization to better secure digital transformation. 
 
<p>Shared security model in the cloud will be the defining factor for managing access requests. The old security model of “inside means trusted” and “outside means untrusted” has been broken since most digital assets and devices are outside the enterprise, as are most identities. The shared security model provides a more integrated, scalable, flexible and reliable approach to digital asset access control than traditional security perimeter controls.</p>
<p>Organizations are already opting for these integrated, cloud agnostic access security platforms which embed strong access management controls, such as verification and authentication of users for privileged account access via single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). These features add a multitude of risk mitigation benefits and create sources for contextual adaptive access controls.</p>
<p>Thales SafeNet Trusted Access platform can help business today reach a Zero-Trust access management future. SafeNet Trusted Access has been recognized by <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80547/thales-safenet-trusted-access-platform/">KuppingerCole</a> as “a market leading Enterprise Authentication and access management solution. It offers a variety of hard and soft token solutions as well as FIDO compliant authenticators. It is highly scalable and built for environments that require the highest security levels.”</p>
<p>The report highlights, as strong points and benefits of SafeNet Trusted Access, the compatibility with FIDO 2.0 protocol, a good out-of-the-box selection of connectors for a variety of apps, integrations with most IAM and IDaaS products, strong anti-tampering mechanisms, and machine learning risk detection models.</p>

<p>Bloom makes its first donation to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Claims and Credentials Working Group</p> The DIF and Working Groups <p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> is a Joint Development Foundation project that facilitates IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players in the decentralized identity space. It produces open-source code, pre-standard specifications, market collaboration, and non-technical documentation.</p><p>Working Groups (WG) are at the core of DIF. These groups are scoped by functional areas and are designed to drive emerging standard specifications backed up by open-source code. </p><p>Bloom is a member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims and Credentials WG</a>, which focuses on standards and technology that create, exchange, and verify claims and credentials in a decentralized identity ecosystem. The Claims and Credentials WG &nbsp;hosts specifications for projects like the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> and Credential Manifest. Although these specifications outline the data models for requesting and issuing Claims, they don't specify how the data is sent between the holder and issuer/verifier. Enter WACI! </p> Wallet And Credential Interactions (WACI) <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/waci-presentation-exchange/">WACI</a> was introduced at the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_32_Book_of_Proceedings_Final%20A%201.pdf">annual IIW32 Workshop</a> &nbsp;with a very warm response. Its goal is to specify how interactions between a wallet and Relying Party (RP) such as an issuer or a verifier happen. At its core, WACI is a handshake of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>s, where the RP signs a JWT that is given to the wallet, and the wallet signs another JWT containing the initial token as a "challenge" claim. This allows the wallet to prove ownership of its DID. <br><br>The easiest way to see the benefit of WACI is to offer a way to log into an application without a password with Verified Credential (VC) based authentication that cannot be faked. </p><p>A picture (demo video in our case) is worth a thousand words:<br></p> Next Steps for Bloom and C&amp;C WG   Achieve v1 release of WACI-Presentation-Exchange <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-and-credential-interactions">specification</a>  Fold back in lessons and extensions from #1 and then flush out remaining sections to achieve v1 feature-completeness for v1 of the WACI specification and sample implementation  Register a custom URI schema (<code>waci:</code>//)

 Lessons from place-based strategic innovation in Europe, Asia and&nbsp;Africa <blockquote>This is the third in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #3 is a preview of our international portfolio around place-based strategic innovation, from the city to country levels, across Europe, Asia and&nbsp;Africa.</blockquote> In theory — What do we mean by place-based strategic innovation? <p>Innovation involves something new coming into existence. Whereas we see place-based strategic innovation to be something new coming into existence with the purpose of interacting with, and actively changing, the systems that shape a&nbsp;place.</p><p>In theory, we understand place-based strategic innovation to manifest with a focus&nbsp;on:</p>  Learning / Capability &amp; Capacity Building / Potential for Systems&nbsp;Change  Grand Challenge / Complex&nbsp;Problem  Traction / Tangibility / Visibility  Connectivity / Cross-cutting  Systemic Nature / Transformational  Catalytic / Multiple Horizons / Multiple&nbsp;Impacts  Stakeholder Diversity / Deep Engagement / Movement Building.  <p>What does it look like at the city&nbsp;level?</p><p>To pursue transitions on the scale and depth required to address deep-rooted challenges faced by cities, we must recognise that urban environments are made up of a complex web of dynamic and adaptive systems and act upon them accordingly.</p><blockquote>From single-point solutions &gt; to systems innovation and transformation</blockquote><blockquote>From portfolio of projects &gt; to portfolios of strategic experiments</blockquote><blockquote>From single-lever experimentation &gt; to multi-lever ‘full-stack’ experimentation</blockquote><p>An urban transition portfolio works to accelerate and deepen change in a city by marking out new pathways at the forefront of action. The insights and actionable intelligence that emerge, help inform the strategic decision making and investment required.</p><p>Strategic innovation in&nbsp;cities</p><p>There is no single, unifying theory of change that guides us. It combines at least the following:</p>  Product innovation — identifying discrete problems and developing products as solutions to test&nbsp;out.  Capability building — identifying outdated approaches / ways of working that aren’t conducive to strategic innovation and seeding alternative habits, rituals &amp; norms in strategically significant people and organisations.  Movement-building — developing new narratives that galvanise ‘coalitions of the willing’ and form the bedrock of legitimacy for&nbsp;change.   Overview of a few initiatives in that&nbsp;domain  Healthy, Clean Cities — Deep Demonstration across&nbsp;Europe <p>While political leaders across the continent are setting ambitious targets to achieve net-zero emissions, how to deliver on this at a pace and scale necessary remains&nbsp;unknown.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs has been supporting <a href="http://climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> to work with the most ambitious mayors and municipalities in Europe to co-create a portfolio of joined-up strategic experiments that provide them with new knowledge, innovations and capabilities that can aid them in their Climate Action Plans — from mobility to waste to energy to health to the built environment — and help other cities to navigate the great transitions required for ‘Transformation in Time’. For more information on this initiative, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/accelerating-city-transitions-3baadbfdcd68?source=collection_home---2------4-----------------------">click&nbsp;here.</a></p> NextGenCities Program: Zimbabwe +&nbsp;Angola <p>As part of the <a href="https://undpinnovationdays.com/Harare">2019 Harare Innovation Days</a> (HID), Dark Matter Labs worked with UNDP country office staff, ‘strategic urban risk holders’ and edge experimenters from 23 countries across Africa under the banner of #NextGenCities to build shared understanding of the interdependencies and complexities facing Africa’s diverse urban realities, with clear clusters of common challenges — such as urban economies and informality, water management, the jobs deficit and waste services — you can read more about the context of HID in a <a href="https://medium.com/@undp.innovation/african-cities-disrupting-the-urban-future-5a774b101e58">blog</a> published before the&nbsp;event.</p><p>We then developed a #NextGenCities pilot program that sought to build capabilities for designing mission-based strategic portfolios of interventions to tackle wicked issues and dynamics that COVID merely surfaced and accelerated. As<a href="https://www.africancentreforcities.net/people/edgar-pieterse/"> Edgar Pieterse</a> of the African Center for Cities in Cape Town, African cities desperately need <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/poldev/2626">“a more coordinated, sequenced and integrated approach to infrastructure planning, investment, delivery, maintenance and repair.”</a> Two countries qualified for the program, Zimbabwe and Angola and we spent four months with teams from UNDP’s Accelerator Labs working on food security and urban markets for Zimbabwe and Angola respectivelys.

The NDS is also being prepared against a backdrop where European countries are dealing with the health, economic and social crisis presented by the Covid-19 pandemic to lay the foundations to “build back better”, in a way that delivers a healthy future for everyone.</p><p>Building System Intelligence in Bhutan, Philippines and&nbsp;India</p><p>Dark Matter Labs has worked with UNDP Asian Pacific Regional Innovation Centre, UNDP Bhutan, Philippines and India, which look at youth unemployment and food security issues. These two systematic challenges have a clear intention of building system intelligence: sense-making capacity and transitional capacity to understand the interdependent nature of local/national/global problems and create governance opportunities for shared learning beyond the boundaries of ‘nation’. The project aims to create a shared, cross-cutting portfolio of interventions and transnational governance innovation for both India &amp; the Philippines rather than making comparisons as the food systems/crisis cannot be solved by one nation in isolation. You can read more about one of these initiatives in the following blog: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/breaking-the-silos-through-participatory-systems-mapping-fccf9c2d01ab">Breaking the Silos Through Participatory Systems&nbsp;Mapping</a>.</p> In practice — Key&nbsp;lessons <p>Strategic innovation cannot be the starting point, it needs to sit within a context. People and organisations are more willing to ‘lean into’ strategic innovation if it builds upon local identities, pre-existing strategies, strength and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Strategic innovation cannot be held by only one stakeholder. Designing and deploying strategic innovation in a meaningful way requires deliberate ecosystems of technical expertise and local partners / brokers. This entails working with a consortium of partners, which presents its own challenges.The sheer amount of coordination and management of politics and personalities cannot be under-estimated.</p><p>Strategic innovation is political. Political realities dictate the permission for strategic innovation, the power dynamics that shape strategic innovation and the pace by which strategic innovation can be pursued in a place. It dictates the pace and orientation of&nbsp;change.</p><p>For innovation to be strategic, we need to understand the broader picture. Reframing the problem / opportunity space can help unleash strategic innovation — sowing the seeds of new mental modes that flourish further down the line. It is no longer about this single problem or solution.</p><p>For problem owners, strategic innovation is as much about organisation &amp; culture change as it is about problems and solutions. Understanding how each organisation needs to change in order to be more systemic &amp; strategic in the way they approach innovation is a real journey that takes&nbsp;time.</p><p>Strategic innovation at a national level can help test many approaches against machineries of policy making and programme delivery across the whole spectrum of national priorities, cascaded down across regions to municipalities. It helps create various adaptations of the same idea at different levels.</p><p>Strategic innovation at the national scale means we need to be much more strategic, political and adaptable in our own language. We will need to also be more practical and proactive on strategies. For instance, we had to create a glossary on what our terms meant so that when these new concepts were translated into local languages to make sure the value of the innovation would not be&nbsp;lost.</p><p>In strategic innovation, there is a delicate balance between the watering down of the purity of ideas VS greater societal and political acceptance that brings a framework for implementation (and often funding to do the work). On the one hand, we want to be precise and creative the language to open up new ways of seeing, and at the same time we want to ensure that the words we use don’t alienate the people we work with, as well as the people they&nbsp;serve.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-2-f5f270d13428">#2</a> here, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

<p>UTU’s AI-driven trust infrastructure to build comprehensive profiles on data providers, data consumers and data sets in Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://utu.io/">UTU</a> to launch their Web3 trust infrastructure for a safer internet on <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> and to build mechanisms to share data between the two platforms.</p><p>UTU’s vision is to make the internet a safer, more trusted place to gather, share, work, and trade. Its AI-driven trust infrastructure can ingest the activity of Ocean Market data providers, data consumers, datasets, and other entities to build comprehensive profiles. Additionally, Ocean Market users will be able to rate and review each of these entities. All of this data will be dynamically analyzed to create a trust score for each entity. It uses blockchain to reward trustworthy actors and to ensure reviews and ratings cannot be manipulated.</p><p>There are four components that UTU will build with Ocean, on both Ethereum Mainnet and&nbsp;Polygon:</p>  A standalone web app that rates Ocean data assets and accounts;  A widget that incorporates ratings directly into the Ocean&nbsp;Market;  A curation engine that recommends the most relevant data assets and accounts to Ocean Market&nbsp;users;  Updates to all of the above once Ocean v4 is released.  <p>This partnership will lead to increased platform trust and transparency, which will reduce friction in transactions, help users more easily discover quality datasets from trusted data providers to either use for data analysis or stake, avoid pool rug pulls and other malicious activity, and more. Fees for software development and UTU API usage will be funded by the Ocean Protocol Foundation, and the bulk of the work will be completed by Q4 2021. We will also explore ways to share data between our platforms in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol’s mission is all about creating a trustless system for sharing data, so we’re very excited about our joint venture with UTU. It’ll allow good actors on Ocean Market to display the trust they’ve earnt in the marketplace, which in turn will incentivize others to trust those actors again and again — a virtuous cycle of transparency and trust without centralized intermediaries.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>The UTU protocol compensates users for providing accurate ratings and reviews, and for sharing their data with the UTU platform. The collaboration will make it easier for UTU users to further monetize their data on Ocean Market by becoming a data provider; users will retain full control over what data to share with either platform, what data they would like to monetize, and how it should be&nbsp;used.</p><blockquote>UTU and Ocean Protocol share the beliefs that 1) data is a new asset class and 2) data privacy is of utmost importance. We’ve studied their data models in the past and are impressed by the ecosystem that they’ve built. This is why we’re so excited to partner with them to increase trust in their data marketplace and to facilitate data sharing between our platforms in a privacy-preserving way. This partnership is particularly exciting for us as I remember Trent giving a small talk to our incubator cohort at Zeroth AI back in 2018 and thinking that an UTU-Ocean collaboration would be a massive validation and use case for our model — 3 years to come full circle on&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>– Jason Eisen, Co-Founder and CEO of&nbsp;UTU</blockquote><p>We will explore additional ways to share data between our protocols:</p>  Putting publicly-available, on-chain UTU data (such as endorsements, transactions, and more) on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Purchasing datasets on Ocean Market that may be helpful to the UTU protocol.  Analysing who provided and consumed which datasets, and who provided liquidity on which datasets on Ocean (using the staking/curation mechanism) to derive UTU recommendations and feedback.   About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a new Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the new Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

I love this time of year; the progression of flowers bursting like a well-funded fireworks show, the lettuce unfolding and gracing the dinner table every evening, the strawberries that are not quite ripe enough but you stuff your face with them anyway.</p><p>I see the Holochain developer ecosystem going through a similar flush of growth. I’ll be honest: we’re still young and small, but that means the developers generally know each other and support each other well, and we’re able to support them well too. This seems to be creating a lot of vitality, sort of like those two small garden boxes in your backyard that thrive because they’re just enough for you to take care of.</p><p>Here are a few things that have caught my eye lately.

I especially love the one that shows how Holochain handles the <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/concepts/validation-rules/#but-what-happens-with-51-of-malicious-nodes">dreaded 51% attack</a> (or worse) without <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/">miners or consensus</a>.  <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/">Developers</a> introduces you to the building blocks of hApp development — data structures, host API calls, built-in patterns. There are code-along exercises that give you experience writing DNA code.  Holochain Playground simulator showing six bad actors who try to stage a 60% attack. Through a few rounds of validation and ‘warranting’ (publishing evidence of malicious activity), the four good actors isolate themselves from the bad actors.<p>This project is a collaboration between a few active community members, and it’s still in its early stages. If you’re already familiar with hApp development and would <a href="https://github.com/holochain-gym/">like to contribute</a>, I’m sure they’d be super grateful.</p> Holochain Open Dev: libraries for use in your own hApps <p>I’ve reported on the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">Holochain Open Dev GitHub org</a> since the Holochain Redux days. Now with a rapidly maturing Holochain RSM and a bunch of hApps being built, it’s gaining new modules while the existing ones are getting refactored. Here are a few ones that looked interesting:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles</a> lets users choose a nickname (AKA screen name, username, or handle) and save profile information as key/value pairs. It also comes with a sample UI to show you how to use it on the front end. The interesting thing about this module is that nicknames are not exclusive — just like in real life, it’s perfectly okay for two people to have the nickname <code>stina_nilsson</code> if that’s what their name actually is. This demonstrates the beauty and weirdness of an agent-centric, consensus-free system.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts</a>, from the Kizuna team, lets users store lists of friends (contact list) and enemies (block list), as in a social media or communication app. I didn’t see any documentation, but the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts/blob/main/zome/zomes/contacts/src/lib.rs#L26-L64">module’s API</a> looks pretty self-documenting.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index</a>, from the Perspect3vism and Junto teams (more on them below), is one solution for retrieving data by time range. This is good for social media, blogs, financial records, and other time-based data. It also eliminates DHT hotspots that would normally come from putting a zillion links on one anchor. This repo is exquisitely documented and gives rationales for the design.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events</a> implements a basic calendar. This looks like it would be great for shared personal calendars, events, or resource booking. As with <code>profiles</code>, it includes a sample UI.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage</a> is a generic blob-storage module. It ‘chunks’ files behind the scenes — this prevents DHT hot spots (imagine some poor peer with a 32GB smartphone having to store your hour-long holiday video in their DHT shard) but also may make it possible to implement streaming videos. (And besides, there’s a 16MB limit on DHT entries anyway.)  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/reusable-module-template">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/reusable-module-template</a> is just what it sounds like — a template that lets you scaffold modules that you want other developers to use.   Holochain In Action: a community of co-learning <p>I’ve been following the work of the Holochain in Action group for a little while, and I’m excited about what they’re doing. This group meets every Tuesday to learn, teach, share, and develop together. There’s a big focus on exploring and implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> that are appropriate for Holochain, which I think is important work.</p><p>If you’re a developer and want to get involved, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">jump to the forum</a> and fill out the application form. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">watch their past videos on YouTube</a> — looks like there are a lot of good presentations.</p><p>Finally, you can check out the app they’re working on, called <a href="https://github.com/holochain-in-action/peer-share">Peer Share</a>, which lets people share content of all sorts with each other. They’re using it to explore various patterns, including an interesting one called the JSON-Schema pattern. Instead of having to define entry types at compile time, DHT administrators can create new types on the fly using the <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON-Schema</a> vocabulary to validate content that’s supposed to conform to those types.</p> Ad4m and Perspect3vism: a unique take on application development <p>I find this a very intriguing project. I’m still wrapping my head around it; it feels like it could have profound implications for the way we construct our online experiences. And when I say that, I mean users, not developers. It appears to be <a href="https://ad4m.dev/">an agent-centric approach</a> to building an online life, consisting of ‘languages’ (ways of expressing oneself, such as a tweet, a to-do list, or a chess move) and ‘perspectives’ (spaces in which one wants to participate) that a person can combine in ways that suit them best.</p><p>The architectural approach reminds me of Holoscape, and the vocabulary reminds me of the Junto social app, which shouldn’t be surprising: it’s a collaboration between Holo team member <a href="https://github.com/lucksus/">Nicolas Luck</a> and <a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto</a> lead developer <a href="https://github.com/jdeepee">Josh Parkin</a>.</p> Holo-REA: a toolkit for cooperative economics <p>I get pretty passionate about non-coercive, appropriately sized, regenerative economies. It’s possibly the biggest reason I got involved with Holochain — because I saw that it had the potential to be a platform for these sorts of initiatives.</p><p>So I’m thrilled that Holo-REA is nearing maturity. Holo-REA is a toolkit for economic applications, particularly ones in which the players do their accounting out in the open (though it doesn’t exclude a bit of privacy either). The folks behind Holo-REA are building it to support a <a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/value-flows-model-lynn-foster-mikorizal-part-1/">big vision</a> of true-cost accounting, or considering all the costs of producing a good or delivering a service. This is something the current economic system <a href="https://youtu.be/KVTLLrP9uOg">isn’t great at</a>.</p><p>Holo-REA implements a business ontology called <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a>. It looks complicated, but it’s really just a formalisation of things that <a href="http://mikorizal.org/ValueFlows-Story.pdf">people do all the time</a>. This gives me hope that Holo-REA, and the applications that’ll be built on it,</p><p>You can find the source code for Holo-REA, along with lots of good literature on the why and how of the project, at <a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea</a> . Lots of people who are building on Holochain are already getting excited about it and <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/digital-environment-for-material-commons-based-peer-production-with-sensorica/5659">planning to use it</a> in their own projects.</p> Dev Camp postponed until September; lots of opportunities before then <p>The response to the next community-run dev camp has been overwhelmingly positive — and overwhelming!</p><blockquote>More than 700 people have registered, which has resulted in the organisers changing their plans.</blockquote><p>It’s moving from June to September, and they’ll be working with us at Holo to provide more learning opportunities — both during and before.</p><p>You can still register, and the organisers will send you updates by email so you know what’s going on.</p><p>The theme of the Dev Camp sounds really cool:</p><blockquote>During DevCamp 8 we’re going to be building a multiplayer game: “Tragedy of the Holocommons”<br><br>We will bring every economist’s favorite game to life as a Holochain app! The heart of this game is a demonstration of consensus-seeking in an eventually consistent environment - a crucial part of building any decentralized application!<br><br>Of course, we’ll also cover all the other essential building blocks of a Holochain application, with little adjustments to make it more fun and cool!</blockquote><p>Reaching agreement without relying on global consensus is a challenging thing to understand, but it’s at the core of what makes Holochain Holochain. This will be a great opportunity to understand more about that in a hands-on way.</p><p><a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Register for the Dev Camp today!</a> And if you have any programmer friends who are disenchanted with blockchain, share it with them too. Maybe they’re ready for something fresh and new.</p> Can we have some updates on Holochain and Holo too? <p>Of course! Here are some of the most recent updates:</p>  Holochain has been having some serious performance issues in stress-testing, and it looks like it’s caused by a memory leak in Wasmer, the virtual machine that runs hApp DNAs. The Wasmer team have been great at tracking down the bug and sharing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/64">workarounds</a>, and we expect that they’ll fix the bug soon as well.  DHT sharding is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/833">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/799">active</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834">development</a>. There’s been a lot of work to make gossip efficient in a DHT that includes lots of multi-user machines, as well as the previous work of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-gets-some-parts-upgrades/#lmdb-to-sqlite-the-road-to-infinite-scalability">moving the storage backend from LMDB to SQLite</a> which made performant gossip possible in the first place.  Both dev teams are focusing on improving performance everywhere. Some of these improvements (like batching database writes) will stick around, while others will become obsolete once DHTs can be sharded.  There’s a new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/830">standalone bootstrap server</a> that doesn’t require you to use Holo’s or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/bootstrap/">deploy</a> your own on CloudFlare. This was created for testing, but it could be useful for applications that want to run their own infrastructure. Note that it doesn’t persist any peer information on restart; it’s all in-memory. (If you’re not familiar with the bootstrap server, it makes introductions between peers so they can start communicating with each other.)  The Holochain dev team is getting ready for the second public release of Holochain RSM, which will include all the changes since the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">first release in February</a>. Many developers have been tracking the changes in the <code>develop</code> branch; this will support developers who prefer something a bit more stable, as well as ones who prefer not to work in Holonix.  BREAKING CHANGE: all the DHT retrieval functions are disabled in validation callbacks except <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/812">three new ones</a>: <code>must_get_entry</code>, <code>must_get_header</code>, and <code>must_get_valid_element</code>. This serves two purposes: first, validation functions should <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/#guidelines-for-writing-validation-rules">always be deterministic</a>, and this removes the DHT as a source of non-determinism; and second, it removes a lot of boilerplate because you don’t have to manually handle all the different error types when a piece of DHT data can’t be retrieved. All you need to do is use <code>?</code> at the end of your DHT retrieval function, and the validation will automatically return the right sort of error to the host. Note: this change is not in <code>develop</code> and won’t be until after the next version of Holochain is released.  The Holo team has been working on dev-ops infrastructure that makes it easy for them to switch their HoloPorts to testing channels and back. This is because Holochain development is progressing rapidly and they need to be able to reliably reproduce environments to test apps against different commits. This won’t matter much to you, dear reader, except that it’ll speed up testing and get us to the next alpha milestone a bit sooner!  <p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@seffen99?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Sven Brandsma</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/planting-garden?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>InfoCert sarà fra i protagonisti del talk “Il Domicilio digitale e i trusted services”, discussione che ha come obiettivo quello di fornire un quadro di riferimento e le fasi di attuazione del domicilio digitale dei cittadini e dei soggetti non obbligati. Al tempo stesso intende fare un bilancio e alcune riflessioni per il futuro in merito all’adozione in Italia dei servizi fiduciari come previsti dal regolamento eIDAS, con alcuni dei principali protagonisti sullo scenario europeo e nazionale, anche alla luce dell’evoluzione dello scenario europeo di riferimento.</p>



<p>Introdurrà il talk Massimiliano Roma – Responsabile Comunicazione e Relazioni Istituzionali con gli Enti pubblici di FPA, moderatore della sessione Francesco Tortorelli – Direttore Responsabile Direzione Pubblica Amministrazione e Vigilanza di AgID; intervengono Claudio Petrucci – Responsabile Gestione servizi infrastrutturali di AgID, Riccardo Genghini di Studio Genghini &amp; Associati, Andrea Sassetti – AD Aruba PEC, Trust Services Governance and General Affairs Director di Aruba Enterprise.</p>



<p>In particolare, Danilo Cattaneo interverrà per fornire la visione strategica di InfoCert quale importante QTSP a livello europeo, analizzando lo scenario internazionale che si sta delineando a seguito delle ultime evoluzioni del regolamento eIDAS, e su quello nazionale in vista delle opportunità che si prospettano con l’approvazione del PNRR.</p>



<p>La manifestazione si conferma punto di incontro e confronto tra pubblica amministrazione, imprese, mondo della ricerca e cittadini nonché occasione di approfondimento delle più importanti tematiche inerenti l’innovazione e l’introduzione delle nuove tecnologie nella PA. AgID sarà presente con due appuntamenti mirati ad approfondire importanti progetti di digitalizzazione, di grande interesse per amministrazioni e cittadini.</p>

<p>In our last post we briefly presented <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> and how it evolved from the challenges faced with uPort’s libraries. In this next series of articles we will give <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> a proper introduction and answer some of the basics: why it exists and what it does, followed by articles describing the architecture in more detail, and how to build applications using <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a>. While our name may have changed, the original vision of allowing individuals and organizations to own their own data and maintain privacy, has&nbsp;not.</p><p>The Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) space has been moving fast by establishing standards for decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) which simply did not exist when uPort set out five years ago. What began as a niche has caught wider attention. In Apple’s WWDC last week their Verifiable Health records appear to be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/samples/accessing_data_from_a_smart_health_card">using W3C VCs</a> under the hood. The European Commission recently proposed a new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2664">electronic identity regulation</a> that aims to make identity wallets mandatory for various public and private sector service providers. This progress validates our theory that the task of managing DIDs and VCs is important work.</p><p>Enter Veramo</p><p><a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> is built with several goals in mind. First, we aim to simplify creating and managing identifiers and issuing and receiving credentials through straightforward APIs which run across backend, frontend, and mobile. We aim to provide the ability to do this in a spec compliant way with interoperability in mind. The framework should also be flexible enough to allow for many configuration options (multiple environments, hybrid deployment models, data storage, key management, etc.) and also to accommodate future advances in the space. With <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a>, we took feedback to heart and combined these features into a single framework over the outwardly confusing set of uPort libraries: uport-connect, uport-credentials, uport-transports, and uport-mobile.</p><p>The Veramo&nbsp;Agent</p><p>The entry point to managing identifiers, credentials, messages, keys and more is the <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> Agent. The Agent provides a common interface for core and custom plugins to operate and orchestrates them through an event system. An Agent can be run as a CLI, backend service, within a mobile app, or in the browser and we have tutorials for each on <a href="https://veramo.io/docs">veramo.io/docs</a>. Agents can also work remotely, so you can have multiple agents with specific capabilities that work together to provide tailored functionality as&nbsp;one.</p><p>The <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> Agent takes care of low-level details so you can focus on building your app. Once instantiated, it exposes methods for creating and managing identifiers through the did-manager plugin. Out-of-the-box support is available for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md">ethr-did</a> (Ethereum address), <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">web-did</a> (DNS domain), and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did-key</a> (simple public/private key&nbsp;pair).</p><p>For credentials, the credentials-w3c plugin combined with the messaging plugin handle issuing, receiving, signing, and sending W3C VCs from one DID to another. The data-storage and key-manager plugins handle storing the identifiers, credentials, messages and the keys for signing and encryption.</p><p>Running an agent will depend on your use-case and environment. To get started, take a look at our documentation and tutorials on <a href="https://veramo.io">veramo.io</a>. The CLI tool is the quickest way to see how it works, and we also have tutorials for Node, React, and React-Native. Hit us up at hello@veramo.io or <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> with feedback or questions.</p><p>Coming soon: Part 2 will go deeper on architecture details and Part 3 will show how to build applications using&nbsp;Veramo.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/introducing-veramo-5a960bf2a5fe">Introducing Veramo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Jeff Zirlin, Head of Growth at Sky Mavis, on democratizing play-to-earn in the Gaming&nbsp;industry</p><p>We’ve kicked off season two of Voices of the Data Economy with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie">Jeff Zirlin</a>, Head of Growth at Sky Mavis, the creator of <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, a game that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reward players financially the more they play. During our conversation, Jeff describes the disruptive business model behind Axie Infinity, democratizing Gaming rights through NFTs, and how developing nations are getting involved in play-to-earn. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> The Business Model of Axie&nbsp;Infinity <p>The business model of Axie Infinity is different from a traditional game studio or Gaming company. Rather than relying on selling copies of a game or in-game resources, they have created an in-game economy, where players can sell their NFTs and in-game resources to anyone, anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>“We just take 4.25% of all marketplace activity as a fee. For example, if today, there was around $3 million of NFT volume on our marketplace; 4.25% of that gets taken as a fee for running the game. Right now, that payment goes to Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity. In the future, we’ll even be sharing that fee with all the owners of our governance token,” says&nbsp;Jeff.</p> How are NFTs changing the Gaming industry? <p>“I think the fundamental innovation that NFTs bring to the Gaming market is allowing for user-owned, user-operated games and economies. It creates much more interesting aligned incentives where the players and the developers are both incentivized to grow the ecosystem around the&nbsp;game.”</p><p>Players who are new to Axie Infinity need 3 Axies to get started, costing approximately $150. The majority of players are from developing nations and developing economies where they cannot afford to get started playing on their own. That’s where organizations like <a href="https://twitter.com/YieldGuild?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Yield Guild</a> come in, who own massive amounts of Axies, the game’s native NFTs. Yield guilds offer scholarships to cover these costs; new players participating in the scheme are aptly called scholars.</p><p>But why is play-to-earn NFT Gaming interesting for developing nations? A large percentage of Axie Infinity’s player base has been coming from the developing world — Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, and Venezuela.</p><p>“Around 80% of our player base are from developing nations. That’s important because these are the types of people that need to be using blockchain. It can’t just be for people in Silicon Valley or Berlin. We need people who are coming for the benefits. One of the problems that the industry has is that people think about how we can make it easier to use the technology, but they don’t think enough about why people would use the technology in the first&nbsp;place.”</p> Scaling NFT Gaming by reducing barriers to&nbsp;entry <p>Recently, <a href="https://axie.substack.com/p/seriesa">Sky Mavis raised $7.5M to scale Axie Infinity</a>. Jeff mentions that a part of it will go into reducing barriers to entry for playing. People will be able to play for free to get started; they’ll be getting three starter Axies that are not blockchain assets. But they’ll learn how to play the game; they may get a taste for earning. They might be able to make 5% of the in-game resources that a blockchain user could&nbsp;use.</p><p>“I think that the market for NFTs will be a trillion-dollar industry in 10 years. At present, the in-game market is only $50 billion which is a small size. Why? Because people don’t want to spend money on stuff that they don’t earn, or that they don’t own. It can be quickly banned or confiscated by the game developers. Once they own their game assets, they are going to be spending trillions of dollars,” he&nbsp;says.</p><p>Jeff concludes that Gamers deserve to own their game assets, their game profile, their game identity — this is all property and information they should own. We just have never even thought that people should own this stuff. “At a mass scale, as a society, we are still grasping why people would want to own their data online but more people are starting to demand these types of rights. It’s only going to increase over&nbsp;time.”</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:   01:46–04:00: Business Model of Axie&nbsp;Infinity  04:00–05:20: How NFTs are changing the Gaming&nbsp;industry  05:20–06:25: Jeff’s relationship with&nbsp;Gaming  06:25–11:42: How to get started with play-to-earn in a developing nation  11:42–15:00: Managing a global community of&nbsp;gamers  15:00–18:20: The growth projections for NFT&nbsp;Gaming  18:20–23:18: Deploying $7.5 million to scale Axie&nbsp;Infinity  23:18–25:35: The EU and US vs developing nations as a user base for NFT&nbsp;Gaming  25:35–27:45: How to choose a credible NFT&nbsp;project  27:45–End: The Future of NFT&nbsp;Gaming  <p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<p>When uPort began at ConsenSys in 2015, the self-sovereign identity space was also in its infancy. Early concepts existed as little more than academic theories with few attempts at implementation. Despite the lack of standards or the guidance of a marketplace, uPort began experimenting with our first architecture using smart-contract based identities.</p><p>Over time the technical limitations with on-chain identities began to pile up, which led to <a href="https://medium.com/uport/next-generation-uport-identity-app-released-59bbc32a83a0">uPort’s 1.0 architecture</a> and pioneering the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with our open-source libraries. At the time DIDs, together with verifiable credentials (VCs) were proposed W3C standards and are now nearing official status. Dozens of projects are still using several of our popular libraries: uport-connect, uport-credentials, uport-mobile, did-jwt, and did-resolver, to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>While successful, some of these libraries also presented challenges of their own. Maintaining libraries across different tech stacks (web, mobile, backend) became an impediment to the rapid iteration so critical in a space where standards evolve quickly. Around 18 months ago, we began work on the next iteration of our architecture, a project internally known as DAF (DID Agent Framework).</p><p>The primary goal of DAF was to create a flexible, modular architecture based around a library of core functionality that would run on each primary stack (web, mobile and backend), and could be easily extended through add-on packages. This approach allows us and the developer community to easily add the application specific functionality they need, whether it be additional DID methods, key management functions, new protocols, and many more possibilities without needing to modify the core&nbsp;library.</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the culmination of these efforts, informed by years of open-source work, learning, and iteration, as&nbsp;<a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a>.</p><p>This next major iteration also makes it necessary to begin deprecating the previous uPort mobile app, libraries, and services. The following is an outline of the schedule and what will be affected. If you currently depend on any of these, or simply have a question or two please send us an email at hello@veramo.io.</p><p>uPort Mobile</p><p>uPort Mobile will be removed from the Apple AppStore and Google PlayStore as of June 1st, 2021. The code is already open-source and will remain available in an archived github&nbsp;repo.</p><p>Libraries and&nbsp;Services</p><p>First, we will be archiving the deprecated github repos. Open-source code will still be available for reference, but no further changes/updates will be made. In addition, we will be shutting down hosted services, some of which will cause issues in libraries and/or the mobile&nbsp;app.</p><p>Chasqui: a server that allows communication between dApps, mobile apps (like uPort Mobile) and servers. Shutting down Chasqui will cause breaking changes in uPort Mobile and uport-transports. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Caleuche: an event hub service which allows the backup and sync of uPort mobile app events. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Pututu: a server that allows dApps and servers to send push notification messages to any uPort Mobile App. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The services below are related to proxy-contract identities and will be shutdown a couple weeks&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Sensui: uPort Transaction Funding Service. Shutdown date: May 15th,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Nisaba: provides user verification for the uPort ecosystem. Shutdown date: May 15th,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Unnu: phone verifier and creator of identities.

<p>Are digitally encrypted COVID-19 vaccine certificates the tech-way forward to social living again?</p>



<p>COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented shift in our ability to meet, socialize and interact throughout the world. Almost overnight, we became subject to contact tracing and the need to keep social distance from everyone including family and friends. Since contact of any kind carried the risk of COVID-19 transmission, especially as variants multiplied, there seemed little hope of communities, countries and the world being able to reopen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we take the first steps towards the safe opening of different regions, an increasing number of governments are requiring people to provide validated proof of COVID-19 vaccinations or test results. These certifications must be verifiable and linked to official identity documents to travel, gain access to local venues or anything involving social gatherings.</p>



<p>The good news is there’s been significant advances in the ability to digitally link verified vaccination certificates and COVID-19 test results to an individual’s identity. Many organizations and governments are now looking to create a contactless verification process as part of this digital transformation. Additionally, they need something that will prioritize data privacy. As these solutions are developed and rolled out, several important issues have hit the headlines such as:</p>



  Being able to trust how the data will be used and stored&nbsp;&nbsp;  How to protect against fraud when certificates are often hard copies only and partly handwritten&nbsp;  How to prove the certificate is tied to a specific individual&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>In this series, we’ll look at the real-world benefits of digitally verifying credentials. We’ll discuss problems surrounding proof of identity and keeping data safe. We’ll highlight how your customers can have peace of mind knowing their data is encrypted, never stored anywhere other than their own personal device and can only ever be shared with their explicit instructions and consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using an elegant, safe and user focused smart application that people can use to confidently gain access to venues and travel is the answer.&nbsp; People need security knowing that despite any requirements to provide proof of vaccination or test results they remain in complete control of their own data and are able to start enjoying life and allowing businesses to thrive again.</p>



<p>After months of lockdowns and restrictions governments are looking for safe ways to gradually open the doors and encourage people to come out of their homes and be social again.&nbsp;However, allowing people to travel and attend events still carries big risks, particularly as new variants spread rapidly. Governments are looking to be able to provide documentary evidence ensuring all travelers and visitors are fully vaccinated or have recent negative test results as a requirement of entry. This in itself brings new challenges. If verification remains a manual process, the individual will need to carry and produce several documents that authorities will then need to scrutinize for authenticity and manually check against the individual’s official identity documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ability to minimize physical contact, including the handling of passports and vaccination cards, is a critical element in containing a pandemic. If the existing verification processes also include fingerprint scanning and the need to type in a secure PIN on a publicly used device, then this further increases the risks of virus transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contactless technology is the key to creating an effective solution. Companies are starting to recognize the need to evolve and offer streamlined processes that embrace digital verification. Digital verification is actually not a new concept; the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> back in 2019 which references digital certification and best practices. The need for safe and secure digital verification of personal identity and certification documents becomes even more critical if we are to address and contain the pandemic.</p>



<p>ShareRing’s solution to the current challenges is both innovative and simplistic. It leverages the immutability of blockchain technology to build the highest levels of security, privacy and consumer trust into a flexible digital verification system.</p>



<p>ShareRing has created a complete ecosystem for the issuance, ownership, and consumption of documents. For both the issuer and the consumer of the document/data, the ShareRing system provides fundamentally greater levels of confidence in the validity of the document. It eliminates the opportunity for fraudulent manipulation of data that’s been uploaded onto the ShareRing blockchain platform. For the user, our independent custom-built&nbsp;blockchain platform is available&nbsp;to anyone with a mobile device. And its no-nonsense interface makes it easy for anyone to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ShareRing app includes many unique features providing users with a Personal Identification Vault and Health document access. This allows users to safely store and easily share multiple documents, including their COVID-19 vaccination, passport, national ID card and more, in an encrypted format. None of these documents are held centrally and remain only on the individual’s personal device. Our transformative products offer the highest level of security providing reassurance that documents can’t be accessed by anyone without the owner’s expressed consent.&nbsp;Once the documents are uploaded to their personal device a digital “fingerprint” of those documents are stored on the ShareRing blockchain. This means they are not open to hacking and/or personal data theft, as has been the case with many database-dependent systems in the past.</p>



<p>For businesses and operators who wish to consume the data, we have developed an easy contactless digital journey which allows them to use QR Codes scans to request and check the information they require from the individual. This not only streamlines and speeds up the journey, but it also significantly increases the reliability of their checks since the documents will have been uploaded at source and/or verified using face matching and OCR checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issuer of a document or certificate can be confident that the certificates they are issuing to an individual will not be tampered with or misused by a third party.</p>



<p>Using COVID-19 vaccinations certificates is one example of how our ecosystem works. It also includes actions by:&nbsp;</p>



  A vaccination center that will issue the COVID-19 certificate at the point of vaccination. They then send an encrypted digital copy to the user, which only the user can access using a private key. At the same time a digital “fingerprint” or hash of that document will be uploaded to the blockchain.  The user who receives the digital copy of the vaccination certificate from the issuer and uploads it to their Personal Information Vault on their mobile device, alongside their OCR and face matched identity document which they uploaded when they created their ShareRing account.  A consumer of the data, for example a customs official at an airport or a ticket attendant at a venue, who scans a QR code from the user’s mobile phone which will, with the user’s explicit real-time consent, allow them to see the verified COVID-19 vaccination certificate alongside the user’s ID. The process automatically checks the digital fingerprint on the blockchain. Even if a single pixel of the image has been altered or the document on the user’s device has been tampered with in any way it will be rejected by the system.  



<p>Additional, optional features include the ability for an issuer to allow a user to find their nearest COVID-19 testing or vaccination center, book an appointment and prove health status in a private and trusted way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the ShareRing app, you can have confidence that your customer:&nbsp;</p>



  ID and accompanying information are valid&nbsp;  Will have the security to travel and access venues and events&nbsp;  Will feel safe knowing their information is always secure&nbsp;  



<p>ShareRing is their digital passport to freedom allowing them to unlock the world.

<p>The Inception Of NFT’s Has Created A Craze: Will It Last And Have NFT’s Progressed Beyond Just&nbsp;Hype?</p>NFT’s Have Sold For Millions: So Did ICO’s In 2017: Can We Draw A Fair Comparison?<p>Introduction: Hype vs. Utility: Which Foundational Ethos Causes The Transcendence of Blockchain Ecosystems?</p><p>Throughout the history of blockchain, it has become more and more evident and obvious that hype is a cornerstone of a blockchain ecosystems success, specifically surrounding token price and awareness of the project. Ethereum’s infrastructure smart contract code capabilities transformed the zeitgeist of blockchain, enabling different projects to be built on Ethereum. This notion conceived of the “Great ICO Bubble Of 2017” which led to new projects skyrocketing in valuation without real-world utility. When “The Great Bear Market of 2018” commenced, investors succumbed to digital shell-shock, coming to the clear realization that many of these projects were extremely hyped but lacked utility. Fast forward to 2021, although hype is still a fundamental zeitgeist of the blockchain sphere, utility is becoming the superior and aggrandizing force. Will NFT’s meet the same fate as the ICO Bubble of 2017, or is there something deeper that is incumbent to analyze surrounding real-world utility? Lets delve deep into the intricacies of NFT’s and how projects like AERGO have created revolutionary innovations surrounding NFT expansionism.</p><p>What Are Non Fungible Tokens? The Modern Day Tulip Craze, Or Real World&nbsp;Value?</p>NFT’s, Amalgamated With DeFi, Have Been The Cornerstone Of The 2021 Bull Run, But Why&nbsp;NFT’s?<p>NFT’s have exploded during The Great Bull Run Of 2021, and it is important to recognize the intricacies of what NFT’s are. Non Fungible Tokens is a digital asset(s) that represents real-world objects such as art, music, in-game items, videos, collectible cards, an essay, a unique-sneakers and clothes etc. NFT’s are similar to cryptocurrencies in a variety of different ways, specifically highlighted by their similarities in cryptographic coding. The inception of NFT’s began in 2014, but their popularity has soared over the last two years, and since 2017, over 174 million dollars has been spent on NFT’s. But where do NFT’s garner their value, and&nbsp;why?</p><p>NFT’s main valuation proposition is the inception of digital scarcity. In the traditional exterior world, rarity breeds value, surplus leads to hollowness in many circumstances (see every single monetary currency that has succumbed to runaway inflation since the dawn of humanity). Within the digital world, rarity also breeds value, specifically in an entire consolidated web of an infinite supply of the majority of creations. It is evident that NFT’s hold a value proposition, but how far has NFT’s evolved since the Great NFT Craze of 2020&nbsp;began?</p><p>Value In Non-Fungibility: The NFT Paradigm Of Evolution</p>Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS: The First 5000 Days” Sold At Auction For 69.3 Million&nbsp;Dollars<p>Since the inception of NFT’s, many artistic renderings have been anything but unique. Many NFT’s began as a digital copy of a creation that was already in existence somewhere else. Clips from iconic sporting events to securitized versions of artistic expression that already existed on social media outlets such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter all became amalgamated under the umbrella term known as an NFT. So if NFT’s can be basically seen, screenshotted, downloaded and/or printed, how does this create an exterior value proposition; the answer is ownership. NFT’s allow the buyer to own the digital item; NFT’s enable such a digital feat through digitized authentication which can lead to owners garnering a sense of uniqueness surrounding their ownership of such a unique piece of data. Since the creation of NFT’s in 2014, the function and maxim’s of owning these pieces of data have evolved substantially, and we’re going to find out why and&nbsp;how.</p>Digitized Authentication=Legitimate Unique Ownership<p>NFT’s have created numerous different opportunities for celebrities, musicians, and artists to expand their business models in a variety of different ways. Artists, to begin, can utilize and add stipulations to an NFT to ensure that they receive a portion of proceeds every-time that specific NFT is sold. NFT’s, because they provide digital ownership rights through a unique paradigm, eliminate the need to track an asset’s progress and the need to enforce entitlements associated with any sale of that property. NFT’s can also benefit musicians who can utilize them to provide special perks to fans. It is also evident, to any collector, that it can be extremely difficult to point out what is a genuine collectors item or a reproduction; NFT’s end that dilemma. NFT’s with clear transaction histories back to the original creator would eliminate such an issue that has plagued collectors for far too long. NFT’s have the potential to transform the paradigm of digital ownership, and I believe NFT’s have evolved into the “Vision and Real World Application” stage, rather than blatant hype without a valid sense of&nbsp;utility.</p><p>The Dilemma Of NFT’s: The Great Expense: Different Blockchains Look To Solve The&nbsp;Issue</p>NFT’s Provide Real World Value And Utility: But Their Biggest Dilemma Are Minting&nbsp;Fees<p>The largest breeding ground for minting NFT’s, as of 2021, is Ethereum. Unfortunately, just like expensive transaction fees that plague the Ethereum Blockchain, minting an NFT has unfortunately met the same fate. Although there is a complete guarantee of decentralized digital ownership when an NFT is issued on Ethereum, scalability and high costs plague the network. Many blockchains have attempted to rectify the high cost dilemma of minting NFT’s, blockchains such as Tezos have created scalable solutions that allows for NFT’s to be mint in as little as two minutes and cost approximately&nbsp;.50 cents per&nbsp;mint.</p><p>Blockchains such as Aergo and ICON have also created their own NFT platforms where individuals can ensure the movement and minting of their NFT’s for a fraction of what it would cost on Ethereum. Scalability and high transaction costs have plagued blockchain networks since the inception of Bitcoin and different blockchain projects have been working tirelessly to create a seamless, affordable and efficient digital paradigm for NFT’s to be minted and sold&nbsp;on.</p><p>Future Use Cases Envisioned: The Practicality of&nbsp;NFT’s</p>Changing The Dynamics Of Ownership<p>Ownership has unfortunately been in the hands of middlemen before the birth of NFT’s, but future potential can rectify this paranoia of changing hands of ownership. Similarly to smart contracts, NFT’s enable a reliable transfer of information between two or more parties. NFT’s enable assets to reliably move around within a blockchain system, and blockchain systems such as Aergo are creating bridges where NFT’s can be transferred from a side-chain of the network to a main network. NFT’s can resolve a variety of issues that coincide with land and vehicle ownership. Did you know that less than 40% of the global population has their land registered to the rightful property owner? NFT’s can fix this! Individuals who lack verifiable defined rights find it much more difficult to access financial services and credit. With NFT’s, individuals can verify their rights through original ownership attached to their property through digitized verifiable authentication.</p><p>Aergo’s Merkle Bridge: Bridging The Gap: Rectifying Dilemmas</p>NFT’s Merkle Bridge Provides An Interoperable And Cost Effective Approach To Data Transfer And&nbsp;NFT’s<p>Ask yourself a focal and important question about interoperability from a humanistic and primal standpoint; if tribes can’t communicate through a similar language, how can civilization evolve as a whole? Its a simple answer, we couldn’t of. In the 21st century, one of the main dilemmas blockchains face (as digital tribes) is the inability to communicate with one another. Interoperability is blockchains next step, its destiny as a digital innovation.</p><p>The Merkle Bridge is designed to become a bridge between different blockchains and side-chains, enabling blockchains to talk with one another and exchange value in a cost effective manner. Multi-sig operators are the main and predominant form of data transfers in blockchain systems, unfortunately, a lack of security and increased costs plague this type of transference paradigm. Small transfers cannot exist with this type of paradigm because costs are incredibly high. Aergo fixes such a notion through the utilization of the Merkle Proof Tree, which is less costly and more efficient than the Ethereum Patricia Tree; however, Aergo intends on developing bridges between Aergo and Ethereum. Now how can this benefit NFT’s when utilizing the Merkle&nbsp;Bridge?</p><p>Merkle Bridge’s technology can benefit not only individuals attempting to transfer tokens, but data and information as well such as NFT’s. Merkle’s Bridge can be seen as a type or oracle-feed between different networks that are interconnected through the Merkle Bridge. Many centralized institutions and blockchain projects have issued their own NFT’s without the ability of cross-chain functionality and transference. With Merkle Bridge, NFT’s can be transferred to “wallets” that connect to Aergo and Ethereum and in the future, other blockchain projects connected to Merkle Bridge. Interoperable NFT transfers, as interoperable protocols are inevitable, the future of NFT’s are fated to be consolidated with the interoperable paradigm.</p><p>AERGO Incubated: An NFT Use Case Utilizing CCCV</p>Aergo Has Incubated A Project That Creates Member Vaccine Verifications<p>Since February 2020, it is evident that COVID-19 has conceived of an onslaught against our modern civilization that hasn’t been seen for at least 100 years. Nations closed and economic regimes were brought to their knees against an ancient paradigm that humanity has never truly conquered and risen victorious: The Great Biological War. Blockchain enterprises realized that immutability and transparency thereof could assist in the inception of tracking the virus through vaccine verifications; Aergo understood this notion to the fullest extent. Aergo and Blocko XYZ conceived of an incubated project known as CCCV which enables individuals who have their COVID vaccination to identify themselves as vaccinated by adding a real-time badge and sticker that can be shown to others who utilize the platform. In South Korea, an apparent dilemma is that COVID badges are only given to individuals over the age of 65, that leaves a massive age demographic where identifying who is vaccinated and who isn’t is incredibly difficult to track. CCCV solves this dilemma. Although companies have created COVID vaccination tracking apps, security and standardization have been a focal issue; with CCCV, users can request a badge and a sticker and when the document of their verification is authenticated, it is uploaded to their account. Now how does this tie into NFT’s, Ill tell&nbsp;you.</p><p>CCCV has garnered over 2 million subscribers (roughly 1.3 times the population of the island of Manhattan) and offers numerous different services which include NFT services. CCCV is a social networking platform and professional person validator, simultaneously, NFT’s can be implemented into this platform and its 2 million plus subscribers! Fake online impersonations, false influencer credentials and fraud are unfortunate but occur incredibly often in cyberspace and NFT’s can solve such an issue through unique-original-digital-ownership through the utilization of CCCV. NFT’s service as an authenticity technology that prevents users from succumbing to SNS linkage and enables individuals to create unique personalized design badges that emphasizes personal ownership and authenticity of ones profile. The platform is blockchain based: immutable, trustless and reliable. NFT’s also enable individuals to control the ownership of their own credentials and CCCV provides such a service utilizing this technology. CCCV has a multitude of use-cases which amalgamate digital identity verification, COVID-19 vaccination status and authenticating digital ownership through&nbsp;NFT’s.</p><p>Conclusion: Envisioning An Evolved NFT&nbsp;Paradigm</p>NFT’s Have Come So Far, Yet We Have A Far Way To&nbsp;Go<p>It is evident that since the inception of NFT’s in 2014, the concept and expansion of non-fungible tokens has occurred exponentially over the last seven years. We have seen over 170 million dollars spent on NFT’s since 2017, different blockchain projects creating their own NFT marketplaces, effectively competing with Ethereum by creating low-cost and scalable alternatives, and we’re beginning to see the availability of cross-chain NFT technology. The overall future prospect of NFT’s is yet to be seen, but for what we can empirically observe now, we can presume that NFT’s have a bright&nbsp;future.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency and NFT investing requires substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose! I am not a financial adviser and I am not responsible for any of your trades. It is incumbent that you always do your own research before investing in anything!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-transformation-of-nfts-the-unfolding-8d60fc382625">The Transformation of NFT’s: The Unfolding</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Java has been able to invoke native programs on an operating system for decades. Invoking native programs is often done using JNI (Java Native Interface) and JNA (Java Native Access). In the last few years, Java has also gained the ability to run JVM apps as native apps. That is, they’re binary executables that have no dependency on the Java runtime.</p>
 
 
<p>This is huge! Mostly because it gives Java apps the ability to start up in milliseconds (as opposed to seconds). If you’re scaling up to handle millions of requests and using a serverless environment to save costs, this is a game-changer. Developers have enjoyed using Node.js, Python, and Go on serverless environments for years. The ability to use Java (or Kotlin) opens this world up to a massive swath of the developer community.</p>
 
 
<p>This post will show you how to run a secure, OAuth 2.0-protected, Java REST API that allows JWT authentication.

If you want to see how to build native images in each framework, skip to the <a>build native images for Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> section.



 
 
 
 
 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.1.0.r11-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Launch a Micronaut Java API 
 
 
<p>In a terminal window, cd into the <code>micronaut</code> directory and run <code>mn:run</code> to start it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd micronaut
./mvn mn:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you open another terminal window and try to access it with HTTPie, you’ll get a 401 Unauthorized error.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>$ http :8080/hello

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
connection: keep-alive
transfer-encoding: chunked</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make it so you can access this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an OAuth 2.0 access token and update the JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets) URL to yours (in this project’s <code>application.yml</code>).</p>
 
 






If you’re unsure what OIDC and OAuth 2.0 are, see our <a>Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.



 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Take note of the <code>clientId</code> and <code>issuer</code> values. You’ll need those to get an access token and to configure each framework for JWT authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>micronaut/src/main/resources/application.yml</code> and change the Okta URL to match yours.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  application:
    name: app
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Stop your Micronaut app with Ctrl+C and restart it with ⬆️+Return.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvn mn:run</code> 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 Access Token 
 
<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click Send Request to continue.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have an access token, set it as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM...</code> 
 
 
 






You might want to keep OpenID Connect &lt;debugger/&gt; open to copy your access tokens. It allows you to quickly start over and regenerate a new access token if it expires.



 
 
 
 Test Your Micronaut API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to pass the JWT in as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should get a 200 response with your email in it.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Build a Native Micronaut App 
 
<p>To compile this Micronaut app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will take a few minutes to complete. My 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM took 1 min. 28 s. to finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/app</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/app
 __  __ _                                  _

  Micronaut (v2.5.6)

17:20:23.980 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 25ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080 
 
 
 
<p>You can see it starts pretty darn quick (25ms)! Test it with HTTPie and an access token. You may have to generate a new JWT with <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com">oidcdebugger.com</a> if yours has expired.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Make a Micronaut App from Scratch 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "how did you build a secure Micronaut app"? Did I just hide the complexity? No, it only takes five steps to create the same app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use <a href="https://sdkman.io">SDKMAN!</a> to install Micronaut’s CLI:</p>
 
 
 sdk install micronaut 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create an app using the <code>mn create-app</code> command and rename the project’s directory:</p>
 
 
 mn create-app com.okta.rest.app --build maven
mv app micronaut 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add Micronaut’s libraries for JWT security:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-security-jwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest/controller</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.micronaut.http.MediaType;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Produces;
import io.micronaut.security.annotation.Secured;
import io.micronaut.security.rules.SecurityRule;

import java.security.Principal;

@Controller("/hello")
public class HelloController {

    @Get
    @Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable and configure JWT security in <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  ...
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now you can start the app or build the native image as shown above.</p>
 
 
<p>Now let’s take a look at Quarkus.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Run a Quarkus Java API 
 
 
<p>Open a terminal, cd into the <code>quarkus</code> directory, and run <code>quarkus:dev</code> to start the app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd quarkus
./mvnw quarkus:dev</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Update the URLs in <code>quarkus/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to use your Okta domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 Test Your Quarkus API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Generate or copy an access token from OpenID Connect &lt;debugger/&gt; and use it to test your Quarkus API.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see your email in the response.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Did you notice that Quarkus hot-reloaded your <code>application.properties</code> file updates? Pretty slick, eh?!</p>
 
 
 
 Build a Native Quarkus App 
 
<p>To compile this Quarkus app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The native compilation step will take a bit to complete. On my 2019 MacBook Pro, it took 1 min. 9 s.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner

<p>Supersonic Subatomic Java (in 14ms)! Test it with HTTPie and an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Quarkus App from Scratch 
 
<p>You can create the same Quarkus app used in this example in five steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use Maven to generate a new Quarkus app with JWT support:</p>
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.13.7.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.okta.rest \
    -DprojectArtifactId=quarkus \
    -DclassName="com.okta.rest.quarkus.HelloResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Edit <code>src/java/com/okta/rest/quarkus/HelloResource.java</code> and add user information to the <code>hello()</code> method:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;
import java.security.Principal;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    @Authenticated
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Principal userPrincipal = context.getUserPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.getName() + "!";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HelloResourceTest</code> to expect a 401 instead of a 200:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;

@QuarkusTest
public class HelloResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
            .when().get("/hello")
            .then()
            .statusCode(401);
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add HTTPS support to the native profile at the bottom of <code>pom.xml</code> with the <code>quarkus.native.additional-build-args</code> property:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;quarkus.package.type&gt;native&lt;/quarkus.package.type&gt;
  &lt;quarkus.native.additional-build-args&gt;
    --enable-url-protocols=https
  &lt;/quarkus.native.additional-build-args&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The last step is not necessary if you’re running with Maven, but it is for the native image. Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl">includes SSL for many extensions</a>, but not for SmallRye JWT. The good news is <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/17929">Quarkus will enable SSL by default for SmallRye JWT in Quarkus 2.0.0.Final</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Last but certainly not least, let’s look at Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot Java API 
 
 
<p>In your IDE, update the issuer in <code>spring-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to use your Okta domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
 Test Your Spring Boot API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Generate an access token using ttps://oidcdebugger.com[oidcdebugger.com] and use it to test your Spring Boot API.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see a response like the following.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>But wait, doesn’t Okta <a>have a Spring Boot starter</a>? Yes, we do—however, it <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192">doesn’t work with GraalVM yet</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>However, we’re calling in an expert to help us fix it! Join us next Tuesday, June 22, 2021, on <a href="https://twitch.tv/oktadev">twitch.tv/oktadev</a> for a session with <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long</a>. We’ll attempt to fix things live!</p>
 
 
 
 Build a Native Spring Boot App 
 
<p>To compile this Spring Boot app into a native executable, you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The native compilation step will take a bit to complete. On my 2019 MacBook Pro, it took 2 min. 56 s.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it using Docker:</p>
 
 
 
 $ docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
2021-06-16 02:21:24.193  INFO 1 --- [           main] o.s.nativex.NativeListener               : This application is bootstrapped with code generated with Spring AOT

<p>Bootiful! Test your API with HTTPie and an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot App from Scratch 
 
<p>To create the Spring Boot app used in this example, it’s just five steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to generate a new Spring Boot app with OAuth 2.0 support:</p>
 
 
 <code>http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
     bootVersion==2.5.1 \
     dependencies==web,oauth2-resource-server,native \
     packageName==com.okta.rest \
     name==spring-boot \
     type==maven-project \
     baseDir==spring-boot | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> class that returns the user’s information:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.security.Principal;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Configure the app to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server by adding an issuer to <code>application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure JWT authentication:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(request -&gt; request.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable HTTPS for native builds by adding a <code>@NativeHint</code> annotation to the <code>DemoApplication</code> class.</p>
 
 
 <code>import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@SpringBootApplication
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-url-protocols=https")</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>You can build and test a Spring Boot native image using the steps I outlined above.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Build Native Images for Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>To recap, Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot all support building native executables with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. Yes, there are other frameworks, but these three <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=micronaut,quarkus,spring%20boot">seem to be the most popular</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The commands to build each app are similar but not quite the same.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Micronaut: <code>./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image</code></p>
 
 
<p>Quarkus: <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code></p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot: <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Of course, they all support Gradle too.</p>
 
 
 Startup Time Comparison 
 
<p>Performance comparisons are complex, but I’m going to do one anyway. Since this post is all about native Java, below is the data I gathered that shows the average milliseconds to start each native executable. I ran each image three times before I started recording the numbers. I then ran each command five times.</p>
 
 
<p>These numbers are from a 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM. I think it’s important to note that my WiFi connection was 340 Mbps down and 246 Mbps up (according to the Speedtest app).</p>
 

Table 1. Native Java Startup times in milliseconds







Framework
Command executed
Milliseconds to start




<p>Micronaut</p>
<p><code>./target/app</code></p>
<p>20.4</p>


<p>Quarkus</p>
<p><code>./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code></p>
<p>13.4</p>


<p>Spring Boot</p>
<p><code>docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</code></p>
<p>60.6</p>



 
<p>The chart below should help you visualize this comparison.</p>
 

 

 
<p>The Spring Boot startup times looked a little long, so I contacted my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long</a>. We did a debugging session over Zoom and discovered the longer startup times are because Spring Security is doing OIDC discovery with the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot’s "initialization completed" time seemed to be right around 30ms. The duration between that and the "Started in …​" time is the time it takes to make the call to Okta. We tried optimizing it by just using the JWKS URI. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This only improved the startup time by 1.6ms (59ms on average).</p>
 
 
<p>We also experimented with using <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code> for Spring Boot. This allows you to create a native binary and run it with <code>./target/demo</code>. There’s no need for Docker with this command. Startup times are relatively the same in my and Josh’s experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Our hypothesis is Micronaut and Quarkus do the JWKS lookup on the first request rather than at startup. That’s how they achieve faster startup times.</p>
 
 






We later confirmed this hypothesis with <a href="https://github.com/JasonTypesCodes">Jason Schindler</a> (from Micronaut) and <a href="https://github.com/sberyozkin">Sergey Beryozkin</a> (from Quarkus).



 
 
<p>If I just take the value of the "initialization completed" time from Spring Boot, the numbers look a little more even.</p>
 
 

 
<p>I also tested the startup times on a Linux laptop with 64 GB of RAM. I used the value the framework displays for startup time and did not make the "initialization complete" adjustment for Spring Boot.</p>
 
 

 






If you disagree with these numbers and think X framework should be faster, I encourage you to clone <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples">the repo</a> and run these tests yourself. If you get faster startup times for Spring Boot, do you get faster startup times for Micronaut and Quarkus too?



 
 
 
 
 
 Testing Native Images 
 
 
<p>When building native images, it’s essential to test them as part of an integration testing process. This post is already long enough, so I won’t explain how to test native images in this post. We’ll publish a post in the future that covers this topic.</p>
 
 
<p>I do like how Quarkus generates a <code>NativeHelloResourceIT</code> that’s designed specifically for this, though.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.NativeImageTest;

<p>However, this test did not help me <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67977862/quarkus-jwt-authentication-doesnt-work-as-a-native-app">detect an issue with my Quarkus native image</a> when writing this post. That’s because I was lazy in writing my test and changed it to confirm a 401 instead of <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect#integration-testing">testing it with Quarkus' OIDC testing support</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, see <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/gradle-and-maven-plugins-for-native-image-with-initial-junit-testing-support-dde00a8caf0b">Gradle and Maven Plugins for Native Image with Initial JUnit 5 Testing Support</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, you learned how to develop, build, and run native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot. You learned how to secure them with OpenID Connect and access them with a JWT access token.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’re a Spring Boot aficionado, I recommend you watch Josh Long’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsUAGJqdvaA">Spring Tips: Spring Native 0.10.0</a> video.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for all the examples used in this post on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples">native-java-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Server-side apps that serve up REST APIs aren’t the only thing that’s gone native in Java. <a href="https://twitter.com/gluonhq">Gluon</a> has done a lot of work in recent years to make JavaFX apps work on iOS and Android using GraalVM. See <a href="https://twitter.com/gail_asgteach">Gail Anderson</a>'s <a href="https://foojay.io/today/creating-mobile-apps-with-javafx-part-1/">Creating Mobile Apps with JavaFX – Part 1</a> to learn more about this emerging technology.</p>

<p>The regulators are coming. The regulators are coming.</p>



<p>Whether it’s FATF, FinCEN, CFTC, or one of many other governing bodies, lawmakers have been incrementally shaping new legislation aimed at further regulating centralized finance and DeFi. Most recently, the World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wef-defi-white-paper">published a white paper</a> to help policy makers understand DeFi, so that better guardrails may be designed for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>A confusing regulatory landscape</p>



<p>Companies in this new ecosystem, though, remain unclear on how to lawfully proceed. As we talk to companies about Civic age verification, log-in and KYC, we continue to hear a similar message from them: what should we do about compliance?</p>



<p>As an advisor offering identity services, it’s become clear to us that Civic can bring greater value to our existing and potential customers by offering more of what we do well.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re proud to share a window into the future of digital identity’s role in the DeFi ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic Compliance is coming soon</p>



<p>The new DeFi ecosystem makes it possible for anyone to trade using simply an internet connection and open-source code. The fact that these new marketplaces have proliferated illustrates the need for next generation financial services, but these solutions must begin to operate within the context of necessary compliance guardrails. Fortunately, digital identity with built-in compliance will help blockchain protocols, liquidity providers, and individuals create trust and comply with evolving regulations all at the same time.</p>



<p>More specifically, our newest offering, <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/compliance/">Civic Compliance</a>, will help DeFi companies and individuals know their counterparties, so that all parties can ensure KYC, AML requirements are met.</p>



<p>Civic is uniquely positioned to create decentralized identities, putting users in control of their own personally identifiable information (PII) so they can access compliant DeFi services. Users of Civic Compliance may sign up once and then re-use their “attestation” again and again. This gives protocols and liquidity providers visibility into each and every user transaction. And, it gives users more control over their PII.</p>



<p>Partners in compliance</p>



<p>Whether it’s KYC, AML or regulations not yet in place, Civic is a partner in meeting DeFi regulatory requirements, all while putting users back in control over their unique digital identities. We’re looking forward to sharing more about Civic Compliance.</p>

 If you’re new to Ontology, or confused by terms like DID, ONT ID, and OScore, this brief introduction is for&nbsp;you. <p>DID, ONT ID, OScore…you might have heard us use these words,&nbsp;before.</p><p>Yet, you’re still unsure what they all&nbsp;mean.</p><p>Here’s an overview of the key features that make Ontology&nbsp;special.</p> Decentralized Identity &amp; ONT&nbsp;ID <p>With traditional ID systems, a central authority or tech platform controls the data (e.g. phone numbers, email addresses) provided to it by&nbsp;users.</p><p>The users (i.e. the data providers), therefore, have very little control over how their personal data is stored and who has access to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) framework, <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, is different. By providing a self-sovereign system of data authorization and ownership confirmation, ONT ID puts the power in the hands of&nbsp;users.</p><p>With ONT ID, ID generation, storage, and other critical operations, are fully automated and decentralized, allowing users operating within the ecosystem full control and ownership over any data associated with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Discrete IDs linked across various ecosystems can have multiple delegates and attributes. With verifiable credentials, entities (i.e. individuals, enterprises, institutions, devices) can make and verify claims related to data ownership, access rights, and validation.</p> Verifying Credentials with ONT&nbsp;ID <p>ONT ID allows you to verify credentials, whilst protecting your data and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>You can verify many different kinds of credentials such as passports, national IDs, and social media accounts. Verifying credentials is one way to boost your OScore (more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>The beauty of ONT ID is that you, the user, decide who has access to your verified&nbsp;data.</p><p>For example, imagine a third party required you to verify an aspect of your identity, such as your nationality. With ONT ID, you could share this single data point whilst keeping your name, date of birth, home address, and any other sensitive information, completely private.</p><p>You can <a href="https://medium.com/onto/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet-96943997df2b">create an ONT ID</a> now by downloading <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, Ontology’s decentralized cross-chain wallet.</p> OScore <p><a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a> is an independent on-chain reputation system, generated using on-chain data including your ONT ID, engagements, assets, and credentials.</p><p>Your <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore</a> is based on data authorized by you and is updated to reflect changes in behavior and lending practices.</p><p>OScore is not associated with your off-chain identities. In other words, it respects user privacy and supports full anonymity.</p><p>Your OScore increases as you add more decentralized data to your ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>A higher OScore brings with it certain benefits such as better lending rates on platforms like <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing Finance</a>, Ontology’s credit-based DeFi platform.</p><p>OScore also benefits credit grantors, helping them decide whether to open a credit line and how much credit to extend to a particular borrower.</p> Summary <p>Let’s put together everything we’ve learned so&nbsp;far.</p>  Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) framework is called ONT&nbsp;ID.  Create an ONT ID with <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> to start verifying credentials.  Verifying credentials using your ONT ID helps boost your decentralized credit rating, aka&nbsp;OScore.  Having a higher OScore entitles you to certain benefits.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Simplifying access to IT services by building on platforms for IT workflows and beyond 
<p>ServiceNow, over the past few years, has emerged as one of the leaders in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger" title="ITSM">ITSM</a> (IT Service Management) market and beyond to what today is named ESM (Enterprise Service Management). In fact, the evolution of that market has helped ITSM leave the bunker of IT, and become a strategic element for businesses.</p>
 ESM today is much bigger and more important than ITSM ever was 
<p>The reason is that ESM supports organizations in business process optimization, based on central platforms with centralized data management and workflow capabilities. ESM is way bigger and more essential than ITSM has ever been, because it is business-centric and user-centric, instead of the technical, IT-centric approach exemplified by ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), one of the foundational principles of traditional ITSM. Yes, ITIL still plays a vital role for the IT core of ITSM and thus ESM, but it is just a small piece of the puzzle today.</p>
<p></p>
 For a seamless experience, Identity and Access Management must be integrated with ESM 
<p>Essentially, ESM combines the ability to automate and improve processes with the workflow capabilities on common platforms that allow customers as well as partners to extend the reach. While there is the potential risk of lock-in to such a platform, the advantages outweigh this risk for many buyers (or are buyers just ignoring the lock-in risk, e.g. to ServiceNow?). ESM provides (relatively) user-friendly access to IT services. This is of ever-increasing importance, driven by trends such as Cloud Computing and Cloud first, Work from Home, and Citizen Development.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing: With more and more services procured from the cloud, and a higher rate of change in the use of services, managing these services and making them accessible to the users becomes of ever-increasing importance. Managing access and the identities of users, must integrate with the ESM platforms for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Work from Home: We’ve all learned over the past 15 months that the delivery of new services must become seamless. Walking to the desk of the user and administering the local machine does not work anymore in the age of WfH. Seamless procurement of services is essential in today’s dispersed work environments.</p>
 Usability is not only a matter User Interfaces but of ubiquitous digital identity thinking 
<p>Citizen Development: Low-code and no-code platforms are changing the way of developing solutions. Many solutions are built by the business. They still need management. Platforms that unify initiatives and that help in getting a grip on all services, become essential.</p>
<p>ESM is an approach that helps address many of the emerging needs of businesses in delivering their services, where IT is not IT anymore, but ubiquitous across all parts of the business. Strategic platforms can help here, despite the lock-in risk. But they will only work with the context of the user: Who can do what, who is allowed to access which service, etc. Usability is not only a matter of UI, but of ubiquitous digital identity thinking across these platforms – and the platforms might also serve as an element or even the foundation of the IAM infrastructure.</p>

Tim (~timluc-miptev) will impart the implicit knowledge he gained working with Bitcoin in the course of his projects, and give an open workshop on what you need to know, either to satisfy your curiosity or to jump in and help. Tim will give a structured presentation on low-level Bitcoin fundamentals, intended to make it easy to use Bitcoin resources for further study.</p>
<p>Tim is the technical director at the Urbit Foundation, and wrote the backend for the Urbit Bitcoin wallet. He is currently managing <code>volt</code>, a project to integrate a Lightning client into Urbit.  This workshop will be interactive — Tim will take questions throughout, and will conduct another session later if material remains.</p>
<p>As always, there will be an informal call afterwards to hang out. We will also open a Bitcoin development channel on Urbit specifically to handle follow-ups from this and for those who can't make it live.</p>

It would be useful to be able to attach arbitrary metadata to a user, both in textual format to describe them, graph-store links to materials they've written, automated lists of groups they're in, and programmatically-accessible metadata that can be used for filtering and permissioning.</p>
<p>These contact lists could then be shared between ships as a way to jumpstart people into your social network. Alternate interfaces to chats could give read/write access to them.  While it's unlikely that this exact product would be what people finally use, it would go a long way towards feeling out the user-metadata design space.</p>
<p>This project would be great for someone who wanted to learn more about how Urbit data storage and sharing between apps works, as well as understanding how to interact with <code>graph-store</code>.</p>
 User Stories 
<p>As a user I can:</p>
 
 add text data to another user 
 add permissions/markers to another user 
 create a collection of <code>graph-store</code> links with data about the user 
 automatically collect known groups the user is in 
 search the user's written materials in <code>graph-store</code> (using <code>graph-query</code> or similar). 
 share metadata about users with other ships, along with ways of merging it.

<p>It’s the business challenge of this&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>: how to engage and convert customers&nbsp;in a&nbsp;fast-paced digital&nbsp;market&nbsp;while being&nbsp;good&nbsp;and&nbsp;compliant&nbsp;stewards&nbsp;of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>?&nbsp;There are two sides to this coin: personalization is improving the user experience, but&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data abuse is growing</a>—and consumers are noticing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those of us in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">privacy space</a>&nbsp;completely understand the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">problem</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;fix&nbsp;and are&nbsp;helping brands rapidly&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">bring it to market</a>:&nbsp;building privacy-first products and services that&nbsp;give&nbsp;consumers power over their privacy,&nbsp;and&nbsp;companies an easy way to engage without collecting, managing and risking personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a&nbsp;‘middle ground’&nbsp;solution that brands must rapidly engage or risk alienating their customers.&nbsp;The stats tell the story:&nbsp;</p>



  As far back as 2012, Pew Research found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2012/03/13/internet-users-dont-like-targeted-ads/">68 percent</a>&nbsp;of US consumers&nbsp;don’t like targeted ads and disapprove of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">invasive data surveillance</a>&nbsp;that drives them.&nbsp;  Seven years later&nbsp;in 2019 Pew Research found&nbsp;an even higher number of US consumers, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81 percent</a>,believes&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential risks&nbsp;from data-driven products and services&nbsp;outweigh the benefits.&nbsp;  This past February in Europe,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">YouGov</a>&nbsp;polled 2,000 consumers&nbsp;in France and Germany&nbsp;and found 57 percent don’t want personalized ads on their devices and feel&nbsp;“deeply uncomfortable” about the granular categorization&nbsp;based on highly personal&nbsp;information,&nbsp;such as illness, pregnancy and religion,&nbsp;that drives it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Media and ad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2020/12/07/media-an-advertising-outlook-in-2021/?sh=6b4aa47e70cc">experts</a>&nbsp;get the point:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yashina&nbsp;Burns, Director, Data Privacy and Legal Affairs at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deepintent.com/">Deep&nbsp;Intent</a>, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2020/12/07/media-an-advertising-outlook-in-2021/?sh=6b4aa47e70cc">Forbes</a>: “While CPRA won’t become law until 2023, other states will likely create similar regulations in the interim and further push the ad industry to adopt targeting technologies that are more conscious of consumer privacy. Marketing leaders need to get ready now by focusing on privacy-friendly solutions that limit the use of sensitive personal information. Publishers and platforms that offer compliant data collection across platforms – especially in the healthcare space where privacy is of the utmost importance – will be well-positioned to continue the services they offer to marketers amid the coming regulatory change.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Edmonds,&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of global digital&nbsp;services giant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pacteraedge.com/">Pactera EDGE</a>&nbsp;says similar:&nbsp;“The challenge moving forward into 2021 will be the continued delivery of personalized experiences while maintaining compliance with existing privacy laws and those regulations appearing on the horizon.&nbsp;It’s a delicate balancing act marketers will have to pull off as consumers&nbsp;increasingly embrace the hyper-personalization experience, but also demand transparency when it comes to how their information is being used.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">YouGov</a>&nbsp;poll of consumers in France and Germany we mentioned earlier says it’s the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">behind the scenes</a>&nbsp;or back door nature of personalization that gives people the creeps.&nbsp;This perception isn’t helped&nbsp;by the fact consent to&nbsp;datapractices&nbsp;is&nbsp;often so&nbsp;convoluted and tied&nbsp;to&nbsp;long-winded&nbsp;terms and conditions&nbsp;and privacy policies&nbsp;that&nbsp;consumersdon’t know exactly what&nbsp;it is&nbsp;they’re agreeing to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The YouGov research&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">commissioning agency</a>&nbsp;says,&nbsp;“The EU has a unique opportunity to tackle these issues by making sure existing privacy rules are enforced and by bringing in new rules via the Digital Services Act (DSA). We’re calling on Members of the European Parliament to amend the DSA to ensure users can see all the ways they’ve been targeted and prevent surveillance overreach.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re still&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">waiting to see</a>&nbsp;how US consumers&nbsp;might&nbsp;get similar,&nbsp;national data and privacy protections.&nbsp;In the meantime, we suggest brands recognize&nbsp;both the&nbsp;opportunity to deliver consumer applications with <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy at their core</a>, and the&nbsp;responsibility to comply with <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">tightening regulations</a>.&nbsp;Discover how&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, our complete business toolkit for rapidly developing branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions,&nbsp;can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engagement with asset allocators, quantitative-focused hedge funds and academia to learn more about Ocean’s core technologies</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is collaborating with Battle of the Quants to drive growth within the quantitative hedge fund space and bring more data providers and buyers into the Ocean ecosystem. <a href="https://battleofthequants.com/">Battle of the Quants</a> connects academia, asset allocators, and quantitative-focused hedge funds to explore and discuss the critical issues confronting the quantitative approach to&nbsp;finance.</p><p>In 2021, we will collaborate for a series of events targeting the quant hedge fund world to increase awareness of Ocean Protocol within the industry. The online and offline events, in conjunction with background business development activities, aim&nbsp;to:</p>  Enroll new data providers to Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Increase data buyer usage on the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Increase group usage of the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  <p>Ocean Protocol Founder Bruce Pon said, “<a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/quantitative-finance/#:~:text=Quantitative%20finance%20is%20the%20use,relates%20to%20portfolio%20management%20applications.">Quantitative finance</a> uses extensive datasets and mathematical models to analyze financial markets and securities, helping investors evaluate investment opportunities and develop informed and profitable trading strategies.

 Plug-and-play Passwordless Authentication with Magic and Gatsby.js <p>If there’s one thing web developers know better than anyone else, it’s this: authentication sucks. Authentication is one of those things that seems simple yet oftentimes ends up being a frustrating, overly-complicated process. Even worse, your production app might be completely dependent on your auth server — if it goes down, you’re in&nbsp;trouble.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> comes in. With only a few lines of code, you can integrate Magic into your application to enable passwordless authentication using magic links (similar to Slack and&nbsp;Medium).</p> ✨ Why Magic&nbsp;Links? <p>In my opinion, passwordless is simply better than the typical username/password authentication. It provides developers with a seamless development experience, users love the idea of not having to keep track of a password, and best of all: it works like magic; passwords disappear and everyone’s lives are just made&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is secure. Over 59% of people reuse their passwords everywhere, leading to poor passwords accounting for 81% of all security breaches [<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2017_dbir.pdf">source</a>]. (Gentle reminder to update your passwords! I recommend rotating them every few&nbsp;months.)</p><p>Magic leverages blockchain-based, standardized pubic-key cryptography to achieve identity management. When a new user signs up via your Magic integration, a public-private key pair is automatically generated for&nbsp;them.</p><p>In order to authenticate requests, a user’s private keys are used to sign cryptographic proofs to verify their identity. Thus, your resource server will no longer need to store and manage (1) hashed + salted passwords or (2) user sessions in its database&nbsp;table.</p><p>To learn more about Magic’s enterprise-grade security thanks to the cutting-edge identity tech they use involving zero-knowledge proofs, delegated key management and decentralized ID tokens, visit their <a href="https://docs.magic.link/security">security page</a> or read <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">Magic’s Whitepaper</a>.</p> 💻 An Enhanced Developer Experience <p><a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> is a developer SDK that you can integrate into any application to enable blazing-fast, hardware-secured passwordless authentication with just a few lines of code (even if you already have an existing auth solution). The Magic SDK currently offers support for <a href="https://docs.magic.link/#start-building">32+ ecosystems</a> — from Social Logins like Google, Facebook, and Github to Blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, and&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up or log in to your application:</p>  User requests a magic link sent to their email&nbsp;address  User clicks on that magic&nbsp;link  User is securely logged into the application  <p>In this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate just how easy it is to get started integrating with Magic in just a few lines of&nbsp;code.</p> 👩🏻‍💻 Integrating Magic with Gatsby.js <p><a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby.js</a> is a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>-based static site generator powered by <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">GraphQL</a>. Gatsby essentially takes the best parts of React, Webpack, GraphQL, and various front-end tools to provide a seamless developer experience. If you’re new to Gatsby, you can learn more from their documentation <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs">here</a>.</p><p>I’m personally a huge fan of Gatsby and have built dozens websites with it. It’s great for building portfolio sites or blogs, both of which you can easily integrate with Magic — which I’ll demonstrate below.</p> 🛠 What We’ll&nbsp;Build <p>In this tutorial we’ll be integrating Magic to a static Gatsby.js site and deploying it to Netlify. Feel free to view and try out the production application live on Netlify&nbsp;<a href="https://magic-gatsby.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p> Step 1: Clone the Starter Template &amp; Install Dependencies <p>To get started, clone the starter template from Github <a href="https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial">here</a>. We’ll be working out of the dev/ directory, but feel free to play around with the final code in the prod/ directory. I recommend following along with the tutorial before jumping into the production code.</p><p>To clone the starter template, run the following command from your terminal:<br>git clone <a href="https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial.git">https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial.git</a></p><p>Change to the tutorial’s directory:<br>cd passwordless-authentication-tutorial</p><p>And install the project’s dependencies from the root directory:<br>cd dev &amp;&amp; npm install<br>cd prod &amp;&amp; npm&nbsp;install</p><p>If you’d like to try the final application, you can run the production application locally from the root folder:<br>npm run start:prod</p><p>Otherwise, to follow along with the tutorial, spin up the development server (also from the root folder):<br>npm run start:dev</p> Step 2: Initialize Magic <p>Before we get started integrating Magic into our application, I recommend you take a look at <a href="https://docs.magic.link/">Magic’s documentation</a>. They’ve got easy-to-follow documentation and helpful <a href="https://magic.link/guides">guides</a> on other most commonly used developer tools.</p><p>The starter template for this tutorial lies in the dev/ directory of this tutorial's codebase. To begin integrating Magic, we'll need to install the Magic Client SDK in the dev/ directory:<br>npm install --save magic-sdk</p><p>By default Gatsby supports two environments: development and production. To support both environments, we’ll create two files in the root of the dev/ and prod/ directories:&nbsp;.env.development and&nbsp;.env.production. Copy the contents (it's only one variable) of&nbsp;.env.example to both&nbsp;files.</p><p>Before we initialize Magic, you’ll need to sign up to the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a> to get your own API keys. Replace GATSBY_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY in&nbsp;.env.development and&nbsp;.env.production (in both directories) with your "Publishable API Key" from the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a>:</p><p>Now that we’ve set our environment variable, we can create an SDK instance to initialize Magic.</p><p>Because Gatsby generates static HTML at build time when you run gatsby build, we need to ensure the global window object is defined before importing Magic.</p><p>We’ll initialize Magic in the src/lib/magic.js file like&nbsp;so:</p> import { Magic } from "magic-sdk"  let magic  if (typeof window !== `undefined`) {   <br>   magic = new Magic(process.env.GATSBY_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY)<br>}    export { magic }  Step 3: Handle Authentication <p>Navigate to the index.js file in src/pages and import your newly-created Magic instance.</p> import { magic } from "../lib/magic" <p>Next, we’ll implement our login &amp; logout methods. Handling user sessions is made incredibly easy with Magic. Add these two methods to the same index.js&nbsp;file.</p> // Handle login with email<br>const handleEmailLogin = async (e) =&gt; {<br>    // Get the current value from the input field<br>    const email = userEmail.current.value<br>    if (!email) return<br><br>    try {<br>      // Login with Magic ✨<br>      await magic.auth.loginWithMagicLink({<br>        email<br>      })<br><br>      // Set user metadata<br>      let userMetadata = await magic.user.getMetadata()<br>      setUser(userMetadata)<br>    } catch (error) {<br>      console.error(error)<br>    }<br>  }<br><br>  // Handle logout<br>  const handleLogout = async () =&gt; {<br>    // Logout with Magic<br>    await magic.user.logout()<br>    setUser(null)<br>  } <p>In our useEffect hook, we'll check if the user is logged in and set their metadata if they are. If not, we'll set the user to&nbsp;null.</p> useEffect(() =&gt; {<br>    // Check if user is logged in<br>    magic.user.isLoggedIn().then((isLoggedIn) =&gt; {<br>      return isLoggedIn<br>	// If user is logged in, set metadata<br>        ? magic.user.getMetadata().then((userData) =&gt;       setUser(userData))<br>        : setUser(null)<br>    })<br>  }, [])  Step 4:&nbsp;Deploy <p>Deploying the application is completely optional, but I’m personally a big fan of <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and once you register and connect your Netlify account to your Github, you can configure auto-deployments from the branch of your choice. If you choose to do this, set your build command as gatsby build and the public directory to&nbsp;public.</p><p>Don’t forget to set the GATSBY_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY environment variable in Netlify with your publishable API key from the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a>.</p> 🚀 Wrapping&nbsp;Up <p>So… ready to integrate with Magic? Magic is currently offering users the ability to earn free logins by referring friends. For every friend that signs up for Magic, you’ll both get 3,000 bonus logins — up to 90,000&nbsp;total.</p><p>You saw how easy it was to plug passwordless auth to our Gatsby app with Magic and start playing with the rest of our app’s business logic, so grab your referral link and start&nbsp;sharing!</p><p>Follow Magic on <a href="https://twitter.com/magic_labs">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/magic.labs/">Instagram</a> to stay up-to-date.

 Consortium Partners, Jungheinrich AG and Evan Developing a Blockchain-based IoT Infrastructure Utilizing Self-sovereign Identities for Sharing Machines 
<p>Dresden, Germany,&nbsp; June 16, 2021&nbsp; – Evan GmbH, a subsidiary of Blockchains, Inc., announced that it has begun the implementation phase of its ID-Ideal Consortium project in the&nbsp; <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">Secure Digital Identities Innovation Competition</a> . Implementation is the second part of the multi-month, two-phase competition sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). After being named a winner during the first phase of the competition in November 2020, the ID-Ideal Consortium project was awarded approximately 15 million euros in funding, to be paid out over the next three years.</p>
<p>The mission of the ID-Ideal Consortium is to create a blockchain-based trust network where digital data can be securely exchanged between companies, citizens, and administration. The consortium currently consists of 40 partners including evan, which also provides <a href="https://evan.network/">evan.network</a> , the infrastructure where consortium partners can engage securely.</p>
<p>“We are honored to have been chosen and to be awarded this funding from the BMWi. It will enable us to drive innovation on secure digital identities together with the partners of the ID-Ideal Consortium and to illustrate the importance and value of these on real use cases, ”says Thomas Müller, CEO of evan GmbH. “Within the consortium, we focus on building a digital infrastructure with which companies can securely and autonomously make physical resources digitally available and integrate them into multi-party processes. We believe that the true success of Industry 4.0 will be measured by how we can more easily and securely share resources and exchange data: human-to-human, machine-to-human, and machine-to-machine. “</p>
<p>One example of an ID-Ideal Consortium innovation that partners Jungheinrich AG and evan are working on is the digitalization of the rental process for industry trucks and forklifts using blockchain-based digital identities. With a digital identity, the prospective renter can be attested and verified by the rental company that they have a valid driver’s license to rent and operate the machine. The prospective renter can also view important data about the rental machine in advance, such as operating hours or the last maintenance date. All of this can be done in a blockchain-based digital world, including processing the payment – further minimizing administrative work and eliminating the need for physical paper documents.</p>
<p>Evan is also helping the ID-Ideal Consortium to enable companies to prove compliance with regulatory requirements in multi-stage supply chains. Digital identities built on blockchain technology can be used to trace product lifecycles from manufacturing to usage to recycling. In addition to optimizing processes, this data can also be used to reduce carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ID-Ideal Consortium has a broad and diverse membership to better understand and be able to meet the variety of requirements of today’s businesses that want to enable digital identity-based exchanges. The consortium is led by the University of Applied Sciences Dresden. In addition to evan GmbH and Jungheinrich AG, members of the project team include HTW Dresden, the state capital of Dresden, the Leipzig city administration or Fraunhofer FIT.</p>

  <p>Sessions can be a challenging topic for developers of all skill levels.  Many React developers never consider the internals of session management because so much of the work is abstracted away.  But, it is important to understand  what sessions are, how they work, and how best to manage and manipulate them.</p>

<p>There are several different strategies for session management in React.  In this article, you will learn the basics about sessions, how to manage them in React, and see some examples using common packages.</p>

 Session Management Overview 

<p>The first thing you should know is what exactly a “session” is.  In its simplest terms, a session is some data that is stored on the server.  The server then provides an ID to the client, which the client can use to make requests back to the server.  For example, if you needed access to a user’s email address, you could store it against the session, then return an <code>ID</code> to the client.  The client could then request an email be sent using the <code>ID</code>, rather than passing his/her  email back to the server.  The  <code>ID</code> field is opaque, meaning that the client knows nothing about what is saved against the ‘ID’ field.  The <code>ID</code> can also contain validation and encryption.  And, the server can return client data, which would typically be encrypted, to the client that  he/she would frequently need.</p>

<p>In this article, I consider a range of server scenarios, as many times when working in React, developers don’t have control over what the server does.  For example, when passing session data, the server will include the data in a cookie.  The server may also expect a cookie to be present when making a request.  Therefore, as a react developer, you will be required to include this cookie in your requests.  You may also choose to store the data in <code>localStorage</code>, however  then the server doesn’t have access to it.  Local storage allows for more storage and can persist over browsing sessions, making it ideal for situations where you want to remember user actions across multiple browsing sessions.</p>

<p>Another situation where you may receive a cookie from the server,  is when it is marked <code>HttpOnly</code>.  When a cookie is marked <code>HttpOnly</code>, it cannot be read by the client in javascript.  This helps minimize the risk of attack against the cookie.  For example, if your site has a cross-site scripting vulnerability, marking the cookie <code>HttpOnly</code> will protect the cookie’s contents.  Of course, you still need the data that the cookie represents, so you should make a request to the server for the resource you need and present the cookie to the server.</p>

<p>Along these same lines, you should also understand cookie validation.  The server you are attempting to access should validate the cookie before processing any request on it.  There are many validation tools to help server-side developers, such as signing and expiring cookies.  Many times, the server will provide a way for you to check the state of a cookie without requesting a resource.</p>

 Manage Sessions in React 

<p>There are many packages for helping manage sessions in React.  If you are using Redux, <code>redux-react-session</code> is a popular choice.  If you are not, <code>react-session-api</code> is another helpful package found on npm.</p>

<p>Focusing on <code>redux-react-session</code>, the first thing you need to do is add your session reducer.</p>

   <code>import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { sessionReducer } from 'redux-react-session';
 
const reducers = {
  // ... your other reducers here ...
  session: sessionReducer
};

const reducer = combineReducers(reducers);
</code>   

<p>Next, you need to initialize your session service.</p>

   <code>import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { sessionService } from 'redux-react-session';
const store = createStore(reducer)

sessionService.initSessionService(store);
</code>   

<p>Once you are set up, you have access to the full API by the session service. There are several key benefits to this.</p>

<p>First, you have <code>initSessionService</code>.  As the name implies, this call will initiate  the session service. Below you can see an example of a call:</p>

   <code>import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { sessionService } from 'redux-react-session';
 
const store = createStore(reducer)

const validateSession = (session) =&gt; {
  // check if your session is still valid
  return true;
}

const options = { refreshOnCheckAuth: true, redirectPath: '/home', driver: 'COOKIES', validateSession };
 
sessionService.initSessionService(store, options)
  .then(() =&gt; console.log('Redux React Session is ready and a session was refreshed from your storage'))
  .catch(() =&gt; console.log('Redux React Session is ready and there is no session in your storage'));
</code>   

<p>To understand this call, you should understand the options that are passed in.  First is <code>refreshOnCheckAuth</code>.  This option defaults to <code>false</code>, but if set to <code>true</code>, will refresh the Redux store in the <code>checkAuth()</code> function.  The <code>checkAuth()</code> function is provided by the <code>sessionService</code> object from the <code>redux-react-session</code>.</p>

<p><code>redirectPath</code> defaults to <code>/login</code>.  This is the path used when the session is rejected or doesn’t exist.  Suppose a new user attempts to access a secured page by browsing to the URL directly.  Because there is no session, the user will be re-routed to <code>/login</code> by default, or <code>/home</code> in the example above.</p>

<p>Next is the <code>driver</code> option.  The two you have already learned about are <code>COOKIES</code> and <code>LOCALSTORAGE</code>, however <code>redux-react-session</code> also accepts <code>INDEXEDDB</code> or <code>WEBSQL</code>.  <code>IndexedDB</code> is a database that is built into the browser.  Applications that require a lot of client-side data storage should consider this option.  <code>Web SQL</code> is also a browser based database, however it is not supported in HTML5 and is deprecated.  <code>IndexedDB</code> is considered the default alternative to <code>Web SQL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the <code>validateSession()</code> function.  This will pass the logic for session validation to the <code>sessionService</code>.  As discussed before, this is largely dependent on your server functionality.  If you can validate the session from the client-side, you can implement the logic here.  Otherwise, you can use <code>axios</code> or <code>fetch</code> to make a call to the server to request session validation.</p>

<p>Two other useful functions are <code>saveSession()</code> and <code>deleteSession()</code>.  It is a best practice to enforce some rules for deleting the session, though these rules will vary based on your use cases.  These functions return promises, as does the entire API.  To save the session, you need to pass your custom session object.  Setting the session also changes the <code>authenticated</code> flag to <code>true</code> in the Redux store.</p>

 Learn More About Sessions and React 

<p>Managing sessions in React is an immense topic. In this article, you learned the basics of session management and how to apply them to React.  You also learned how to use one of the most common react session management packages available.  But this is just a start.  I encourage you to look into more react session packages and continue to learn and understand how to properly manage the session.  Doing so will make your applications more secure and performant.</p>

<p>Apple’s WWDC 21 had a great set of new announcements around security. The most exciting one for us Identity and Access Management (IAM) geeks is the update on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/">Apple’s commitment towards moving beyond passwords</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>In this post, I wanted to share some thoughts on this great announcement and what it means for enterprise identity and authentication.</p>
      
<p>The updates presented by Garrett Davidson from Apple build on Apple’s previous support for FIDO2 and WebAuthn open standards in the Safari browser on both iOS and OS X (now MacOS). Previously, Apple provided support for passwordless authentication in the Safari browser by adding a FIDO2 authenticator to the underlying operating system. This was a step in the right direction and followed Google’s Android passwordless implementation, which has been available for nearly three years.<br><br><br>Screenshot: Apple</p>
      
<p>Apple’s approach to passwordless is not particularly unique since it adheres to the FIDO standard, however their implementation and approach to the credential recovery problem is unique and relevant to enterprises. One refreshing aspect of their messaging and stance on authentication is their dedication to eliminating shared secrets.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Statements such as “Each time that a secret is shared, there is risk,” and “Servers are less valuable targets for hackers because there are no shared secrets to steal” are encouraging to hear and reflect what we’ve been saying at HYPR for years. We put it this way: moving away from shared secrets takes an enterprise from an infrastructure that’s expensive to defend and easy to attack to one that’s expensive to attack and easy to defend.</p>
      

      
 Here’s what’s new in this announcement:&nbsp; 
      
  Apple now has WebAuthn and FIDO2 support for native mobile apps. This means that users can enroll for passwordless authentication in a mobile app as well as browsers. These credentials, enrolled using the native app APIs, can then be used on mobile browsers as well without having to re-enroll.<br>  Synchronization via Keychain. Apple’s new feature “Passkeys in iCloud Keychain” —&nbsp;which are what they call the FIDO2 private key credentials —&nbsp; are now synchronized across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;  
      
 Thoughts on These Updates 
      
  Unsurprisingly, Apple’s keychain synchronization is more focused on consumer authentication than the enterprise.<br><br>Apple’s Passkeys approach is concerning. A Passkey is a private key, make no mistake about it. The best practice in security and cryptography is to not transfer or duplicate key material. I do believe that Apple’s approach to this is going to be world class, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a bad practice that adversaries will likely exploit.<br><br>  Enterprises will not want to synchronize their users’ Passkeys in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios.<br><br>Many enterprises allow BYOD. However, the Passkeys are synchronized across a user’s Apple account and devices. That means that if I’m using my personal phone to authenticate to my corporate resources, the credential used to access those resources could be copied over to my iPad that is shared with my entire household. This could hold a significant liability risk because it would be difficult to track user attribution tied to accessing corporate accounts.<br><br>I predict enterprises that want to leverage the Passkeys method of authentication will opt out of the synchronization offering from Apple and require more enterprise-friendly methods for credential recovery.<br><br>  Developers and IAM vendors will need to leverage the strong association between a native app and website in order to leverage this functionality.<br><br>This functionality is seldom used in apps today. It will need to be provided as an out-of-the-box capability since oftentimes mobile app teams and web teams manage projects in silos.  
      
 Conclusion 
      
<p>Overall the developments from Apple are highly encouraging and have an eye on the future of a passwordless world. Many of their approaches are consumer-centric which is understandable, but for those of us who want to leverage these powerful tools on the enterprise side, there are major security aspects to consider. It will be interesting to see how the MDM technologies in the market address and enforce the Passkeys replication capabilities within Apple’s products. It’s exciting to see future developments from Apple on this topic and we look forward to providing these additional capabilities to HYPR customers soon!</p>

<p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-163-eus-portable-identity-supreme-court-on-data-access-rights-d163bcb022f6">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea&nbsp;Project</a></p><p>This week:</p>  When Apple owns your digital&nbsp;identity  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. When Apple owns your digital&nbsp;identity <p>First the good. Apple is taking digital identity seriously — announcing last week that its latest mobile operating system will allow users to store digital copies of their driver’s license in their&nbsp;wallet.</p>Photo: YouTube<p>With a U.S. base of more than 43 million users on Apple Pay in 2021 — according to<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-will-store-digital-us-state-ids-in-apple-wallet-2021-6"> eMarketer for Business Insider</a> — that’s a big deal. And with Apple’s brand and platform cachet, they’re able to drive adoption on both sides of the equation by working closely with local governments. According to CNET’s<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-us-states-will-support-apple-wallet-digital-identity-cards/"> Russell Holly’s napkin math</a>, there could be at least 12 states live at launch, ready to accept Apple&nbsp;ID.</p><p>As GlobaliD’s head of verifications /vs noted, “the digital government ID transformation is further along than you&nbsp;think.”</p><p>So in a lot of ways, Apple just made digital ID relevant — by helping to build the dream where we can finally ditch our chunky physical wallets with a much more robust and convenient digital offering. And because Apple’s business model isn’t based on farming data per se, their commitment to privacy should be commended.</p><p>Now for the not so good. The story of identity should be about individual empowerment. Apple’s story is more about individual convenience in service of Apple. When it comes to the Big in Big Tech, Apple’s as Big as they come — all while being renowned control freaks. Their top-down approach to digital identity isn’t about portability or interoperability, it’s about strengthening their platform moat, where Apple takes a 30 percent cut on all&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Which ultimately serves as a huge tax on creators and developers. Here’s The Information:</p><blockquote>Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said more than 80% of the celebrity shoutout platform’s revenue comes from web vs. its&nbsp;app.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s notable because Galanis is joining a chorus of large and small app developers complaining that the 30% commissions Apple and Google app stores charge customers for digital purchases are holding back smaller businesses, including creators. As we reported last week, some sites that act as platforms for creators, such as Patreon and Medium, side-step those commissions by focusing primarily on purchases over web browsers. Count Cameo in that&nbsp;camp.</blockquote><blockquote>The app takes 25% of a customer’s purchase; the celebrity takes home the other 75%. But if the sale happens on Apple’s iOS, after paying the fees, “the creator is getting 52.5%,” Galanis said. “The big issue here is that if Apple continues these policies, it’s really putting a tax on creators.”</blockquote><p>As we all know, Epic Games has taken Apple to court over that very issue. But that’s basically the point — why do we want a digital identity that doesn’t allow us to choose how we want to pay for things? That’s the end result when your digital identity is still controlled by one of the largest corporations on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Naturally, there’s rumblings as well about privacy concerns when it comes to storing digital copies of your stuff — as<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wallet-digital-ids-privacy-wwdc-2021/"> Mashable’s Jack Morse highlighted</a>. Those concerns are valid — but it’s the type of problem with plenty of potential solutions, whether it be encryption, user education, or UX failsafes. The world is getting more digital — and as more and more companies evolve toward that inevitability, those solutions will only get more refined and secure over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The big takeaway. That Apple is venturing deeper into the digital identity and wallet space can only be a net good as well as being awesome validation for where things are going. The big challenge for smarter approaches to identity will always be around infrastructure and ecosystem development around those new identity tools, and Apple’s entrance in this space will serve as a super catalyst for getting a lot of key puzzle pieces in place such as local government support for digital offerings.</p><p>Moreover, the more people learn about their digital identity, the more they’ll also realize what they really need or what they’re missing when it comes to individual control and ownership. Having a credential is nice — in this case, your state ID in your digital wallet. But it’s really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a portable and interoperable identity’s true potential.</p><p>So we’re already seeing that with the various fights Apple is facing on the Apple Pay side of things. We’re also seeing a lot of initiatives such as the EU digital wallet that will compete head to head with Apple’s new offering, which, as GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd noted last week, was another step in the right direction for a truly portable identity.</p><p>Apple — whether they intend to or not — is getting us all closer to that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="http://global.id/vs">/vs</a>—<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-us-states-will-support-apple-wallet-digital-identity-cards/">What US states will support Apple Wallet digital identity&nbsp;cards?</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>—<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wallet-digital-ids-privacy-wwdc-2021/">Now Apple wants to store your driver’s license on Apple&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/privacy-tech-industry-explodes-52f490ae-e96b-4f1f-abea-13634f5cddef.html">Privacy tech industry&nbsp;explodes</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zuckerberg-jabs-apple-over-creator-fees-floyd-mayweather-joins-onlyfans">Zuckerberg Jabs Apple Over Creator Fees; Floyd Mayweather Joins&nbsp;OnlyFans</a>  Plus, a couple of tweet reactions highlighted by GlobaliD product guru&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>:  <blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/malonehedges/status/1401991977768341504?s=21">https://twitter.com/malonehedges/status/1401991977768341504?s=21</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/psb_dc/status/1401954735020810242?s=21">https://twitter.com/psb_dc/status/1401954735020810242?s=21</a></blockquote>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d573aea0-1c37-429e-812b-5a430f23bb2b.html">Great overview on the state of privacy regulations from&nbsp;Axios</a>   2.

   The biggest obstacle to blockchain-based improvements in the global supply chain isn’t technology, it’s getting companies to trust one another.

        <p>Nilsson observes of supply chain actors, “even if they’re working together they’re also competitors.” But, he says, a public ledger is able to allow for the smallest actors in a supply chain to get involved in the sending and receiving of data. This is in part because microtransactions and small fees reduce economic barriers to entry. As blockchain technology continues to be misunderstood, those stewarding supply chain companies into the future of data must devote their attention primarily to education in the coming years. When reshaping the foundations of global distribution networks, slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists no such thing as a Permissioned/Private Blockchain. A Blockchain is per definition a public timestamped record. If it is not public, it simply is a Private Database with a fancy replication mechanism.</p>

<p>Humpty Calderon <br>Está bien ya estamos en vivo, así que bienvenidos a todos. ¡Quién se une a nosotros aquí hoy! Uh, mi nombre es Humpty Calderon, jefe de Comunidad Ontology, tenemos a Raindy, ¿Te gustaría presentarte?</p><p>Raindy<br>Hola a todos, soy Raindy Lou, jefe de marketing y comunicación de Ontology, me alegro de estar&nbsp;aquí.</p><p>Humpty Calderon <br>Excelente y para que lo sepan aquellos de ustedes que no están familiarizados con Ontology, Ontology es una cadena de bloques para identidad y datos soberanos que saben que hay una gran cantidad de tecnología que se ha creado para facilitar la identidad soberana, datos crediticios, marketplaces, DeFi, sabe que si está interesado en obtener una instantánea de lo que es, puede ir a ont.io y puede ver algunos de los diferentes productos y protocolos que se han desarrollado como ont-id, score, Wing piscinas inclusivas dentro de Wing, que es la prueba del concepto de crédito descentralizado y DeFi, hay una billetera ONTO, por supuesto, que no es ningún secreto, mi billetera favorita de activos digitales de múltiples cadenas, la forma más fácil de crear su identidad digital.</p><p>Una vez que haya creado, puede ver lo fácil que es para usted hacer una verificación suave, una verificación dura lo que necesite y luego, por supuesto, saga, algunos de los cuales vamos a hablar hoy sobre cualquier cosa que quisiera agregar a Raindy antes de comenzar, la presentación.</p><p>Raindy <br>Eso ya, está bien, sigue por&nbsp;favor.</p><p>Humpty <br>Está bien, así que hemos compartido una presentación aquí como una plataforma de diapositivas que sabes si alguien está interesado después de esta llamada para tener acceso a esto, solo háganos saber si en los mensajes aquí o a través de las redes sociales de Ontology o en Telegram, diga “Yo vi esta plataforma de lanzamiento realmente genial”. Realmente quiero conseguir uno de esos para mí porque quiero aprender más, quiero sumergirme en cualquiera de estos temas realmente complejos para aprender más sobre cada uno de&nbsp;ellos.</p><p>Así que, como dije, Ontology es una cadena de bloques para auto soberanos, identidad y datos, usted sabe en tres pasos que puede ver qué es Ontology lo que ofrece y su ecosistema, probablemente los exploraremos paso a paso a lo largo de la presentación, plataforma de colaboración distribuida blockchain pública de alto rendimiento de Ontology, básicamente significa blockchain realmente rápido el consenso ha alcanzado, creo que la finalidad es de menos de un segundo, así que definitivamente una de las cadenas de bloques más rápidas que existe, es eficiente en términos de consumo de gas y es capaz de construir sobre ella. Es compatible con Python, Java, Golang, C ++, así que definitivamente es una vía de acceso para los desarrolladores para que puedan comenzar a trabajar en desarrollo de blockchain sin necesariamente tener que aprender un lenguaje de programación diferente.</p> Ontology que proporciona soluciones DID para plataformas de transmisión de música,&nbsp;ROCKI <p>Entonces, si avanzamos por aquí, podemos ver algunos de los diferentes socios que Ontology ha recientemente incorporó a la cadena de bloques para su identidad, debería decir solución y eso es rocki, si no está familiarizado con quiénes son, son una plataforma de música que está construida para que músicos, artistas, creadores, compartan su música de manera descentralizada y, como se dice aquí, Ontology y rocki han desarrollado una asociación estratégica para integrar las soluciones de identidad descentralizadas desarrolladas por Ontology para verificar a sus artistas.</p><p>Ciertamente, profundicé en eso, de hecho, lo hice anteriormente en la llamada de hoy y en otras conversaciones que publiqué en Twitter y Clubhouse, donde analizamos por qué eso es importante, por qué la identidad es importante cuando se trata de verificar al creador y verificar los activos digitales, por supuesto, la autenticidad es clave, especialmente porque la razón por la que recopila algo es porque desea apoyar a un creador en particular. Raindy, ¿Quieres agregar algo sobre rocki y en términos de saber por qué Ontology ve que el proyecto es importante y valioso para expandir la identidad descentralizada?</p><p>Raindy <br>Genial, así que hablamos con rocki durante mucho tiempo que, dado que el mercado NFT está aumentando ahora y tienen los requisitos sobre el sistema de registro KYC y AML, están encontrando socios que prueben especialmente soluciones en esta área y compararon diferentes proyectos entre todos los que están haciendo, lo mismo que la cienciología y luego de continuar los esfuerzos de nuestro equipo técnico y de negocios, finalmente eligieron Ontology porque piensan que Ontology es el principal experto en esta área, por lo que el objetivo tanto de rocki como de Ontology es que queremos transformar el sistema de inicio de sesión tradicional para cada creador en la plataforma rocki de una forma centralizada a una forma descentralizada para que de esa manera y todos los usuarios puedan tener el poder de controlar sus propios datos y accesos sin vincular la información a la plataforma tan que es muy importante y también es una forma de innovación para todos los proyectos que tiene ese sentido de proteger la identidad y los datos del usuario, así que a través de esa manera ahora vamos a construir todo el sistema y luego mostraremos a los miembros de nuestra comunidad y también a los usuarios que saben que funciona.</p><p>Creo que no habría mucha barrera entre la forma de inicio de sesión tradicional para descentralizar la forma para que los usuarios simplemente inicien sesión como lo hacen antes, pero en realidad está protegiendo su identidad utilizando las soluciones de identificación, lo cual es realmente genial.</p><p>Humpty<br>Sí, creo que otra cosa que vale la pena señalar si observamos que rocki está construido en la Binance Smart Chain, por lo que esta es una plataforma, un producto que no está operando en Ontology, pero está operando en otra blockchain, por lo que es importante tener en cuenta que Ontology ha implementado estas soluciones de identidad en otras cadenas de bloques correctamente, por lo que puede decirnos brevemente cuáles son algunas de estas cadenas de&nbsp;bloques.</p><p>Raindy <br>Sí, además de BSC, también estamos probando soluciones como Ethereum, Polkadot, Tron y todas las cadenas públicas líderes, diría que puede encontrar el registro de w3c en su sitio oficial para ver cuántos hicieron soluciones y registro el cual es proporcionado por la Fundación de Ontology. Entonces, creo que no importa el “ID de ONT” o el O-score, no solo se limita a la cadena de Ontology y el ecosistema que debería ser a todo el sistema blockchain, por lo que estamos impulsando más aplicaciones y rocki es un buen comienzo para fomentar más proyectos. sobre la base de BSC para considerar que las soluciones que pueden ser empoderadas en sus propios proyectos.</p><p>Humpty <br>Absolutamente quiero decir que realmente me encanta esa idea de que conozcas la interoperabilidad y la portabilidad de esa identidad, porque si estás creando soluciones de identidad y las estás bloqueando dentro de un protocolo en particular, ya sea que conozcas una plataforma como esta o solo una blockchain, tú sabes que hay valor para los usuarios, pero ese valor es limitado. Es genial que lo que Ontology está construyendo, usted sabe en ONT-id y O-score y todos estos otros protocolos de identidad es esa interoperabilidad, porque de esa manera las personas que, por ejemplo, pueden utilizar su identidad en Binance Smart Chain, podrían llevar esa identidad a otra blockchain como Ontology.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, esa es la idea para que todos tengan su identidad descentralizada, pero no quieren que sea individual, por lo que debería funcionar siempre que sea posible, así que eso es lo que hacemos y hacer nuestros esfuerzos para eliminar todas las barreras y límites entre las diferentes cadenas para ser la verdadera diafonía.</p><p>Humpty <br>Sí, absolutamente, creo que en los últimos años hemos visto el valor de la interoperabilidad, ya sea para crear algún tipo de puente entre cadenas para activos digitales o incluso dentro de DeFi con el derecho de compatibilidad de estos protocolos para que puede crear un ecosistema más dinámico Creo que lo mismo va a ser cierto para la identidad, habrá una necesidad de esa interoperabilidad y compatibilidad para crear una experiencia más rica, una experiencia más sólida y segura para las personas.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, definitivamente genial.</p><p>Humpty<br> De acuerdo, en realidad, esta es una diapositiva genial, me gusta mucho esta y, de hecho, podría hacer de esta mi foto de perfil por un tiempo porque me gusta que muestra el rico ecosistema y profundo de ONTO-id, la cantidad de blockchain en la que se encuentra actualmente y sabes que esto está creciendo.</p><p>Quiero decir, vemos como dijiste que algunas de las cadenas de bloques líderes aquí tenemos Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Near Protocol, Elrond, Tron, Klaytn, Ontology obviamente, así que es realmente genial ver que conoces el desarrollo que cubre la gama. de blockchains, al igual que tiene su token favorito, es probable que su blockchain favorito, ONTO-id ya esté&nbsp;allí.</p><p>Entonces, ONTO, mi billetera favorita, ve a Twitter, verás que hablo lo suficiente sobre eso y luego sabes que las charlas que tengo en el clubhouse, ¿hay algo que no sepamos sobre ONTO o tal vez otra perspectiva sobre ONTO que creas que es valiosa para que sepamos más allá del hecho de que es una cadena múltiple que admite múltiples tokens y del hecho de que es una forma sencilla de crear su identidad descentralizada.</p><p>Raindy<br> Creo que hay tres puntos los puntos brillantes de ONTO, que el primero es que es una billetera descentralizada, que es diferente de las billeteras centralizadas, por lo que solo mantienen sus activos criptográficos en su servidor y aún tiene el riesgo si lo hacen, algún daño a los activos, por lo que también puede evitar ese tipo de&nbsp;riesgos.</p><p>El segundo es la verdadera cadena cruzada con él, por lo que significa que una vez que tenga su propio wallet, una vez que descargue y abra hasta que realmente se vincule a los otros activos que se admiten como se enumeran, debería haber como 14 en total para que no lo haga, no es necesario obtener una copia de todas las palabras dinámicas para cada diez, pero solo necesita obtener una clave privada para eso, por lo que ahorra tiempo y esfuerzos para que los usuarios administren sus activos y aunque vayan a apagar sus dispositivos. como si tuvieran el nuevo teléfono, luego descargan ONTO en su nuevo móvil e importan fácilmente sus activos&nbsp;allí.</p><p>Entonces, el tercero es que es el único veredicto criptográfico con la identidad activada en poderes, por lo que obtiene el ONT-id y puede tener su puntaje O con el ONTO-id dentro de ONTO, el cálculo se basa en su comportamiento en la cadena también los activos criptográficos que tiene, por lo que es realmente diferente y el criptográfico líder quería, entre otros, diría y otra cosa es que no solo es la billetera móvil porque el mes pasado obtuvimos la versión web de ONTO, por lo que es una extensión de Chrome, por lo que no importa si está usando el teléfono móvil o la PC, en realidad está usando la misma billetera y que es fácil de saltar la barrera entre los interruptores, por lo que solo tiene un ONT-id y puede administrar sus&nbsp;activos.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sabes, creo que tener esa flexibilidad para poder ir desde tu billetera de escritorio o debería decir la billetera de tu navegador e ir a tu billetera móvil para poder utilizarla no solo para activos digitales sino para identidad. Creo que es una experiencia rica esta dinámica, utilidad que le das a la gente creo que eso hace que la billetera sea mucho más valiosa es una de las cosas que digo cada vez que hablo con la gente sobre billeteras digitales lo digo y lo sabes honestamente, además creo que la billetera digital ha recorrido un largo camino desde el principio pero sabes que todavía hay espacio para la evolución, todavía hay espacio para mejorar y a medida que la identidad comienza a convertirse en un elemento importante para ayudar a que blockchain y cryptos,&nbsp;maduren.</p><p>Creo que veremos un montón de valor en tener billeteras que tengan estas soluciones integradas en estas soluciones de identidad y quiero decir que no estoy diciendo que sepa lo que hacen todas las billeteras, pero no creo que haya otra billetera.</p><p>Esto es lo que tiene ONTO en términos de esa flexibilidad y esa rica utilidad de conocimiento que va más allá de simplemente mantener activos digitales o más allá de simplemente trabajar en múltiples cadenas de&nbsp;bloques.</p> ¿Por qué&nbsp;ONTO? <p>Humpty <br>Entonces, ya sabe un poco sobre lo que acabamos de hablar en términos de por qué desea usar ONTO, sepa que es esa billetera descentralizada, usted es dueño de sus activos, posee sus claves, le brinda o le permite tener su identidad también como parte de su billetera digital, creo que sabe que todos estos son elementos críticos para hacer que estas billeteras sean más seguras y las hace más valiosas para las personas, ya que, como dije, blockchain continúa creciendo y evolucionando.</p> Beneficiarios de ONTO&nbsp;ID <p>Humpty<br> Entonces, no sé si vamos a hablar sobre el o-score en una de estas próximas diapositivas, tal vez ya hemos ido más allá porque hemos hablado de ONT-id, pero creo que tal vez no deberíamos ir demasiado lejos, sin hablar de o-score, ambos van de la mano juntos o-score en ONTO-id siendo su identidad digital correcta y luego o-score siendo su reputación basada en esa identidad, ¿podría darnos una introducción rápida a qué es el o-score y por qué es importante desde su perspectiva.</p><p>Raindy<br> Claro, entonces, una vez que todos tienen la identidad, es como un identificador para que la gente lo conozca, quién es usted, pero cómo pueden juzgar su confianza, eso se basa en el puntaje o-score, por eso tenemos el o-score el protocolo de puntuación en nuestro ecosistema, por lo que todos pueden obtener una puntuación extra de las clasificaciones o puntuaciones que se basan en su ONTO-id y se vincula a todos los comportamientos que hacen en el chat, pero se puede personalizar de acuerdo con sus propias demandas, por lo que diría que no hay límite o pautas para decirle a la gente que cómo se generará su puntaje o porque es bastante diferente, depende de diferentes demandas, por lo que básicamente el caso de uso, Wing Finance, la plataforma DeFi que es desarrollada por la autoridad, por lo que hay un grupo inclusivo que es una plataforma de aprendizaje basada en créditos, por lo que una vez que obtenga su puntaje o, le permite estar sub-caracterizado para obtener los activos criptográficos permitidos.</p><p>Digamos que tienes $1000 USD como garantía, puede ser el USDT y obtienes un puntaje muy alto, entonces te permite pedir prestado como $ 1.000 y $ 100.000 USD tal vez en función de la confianza que tengas en el chat, por lo que hace que en la aplicación real permitir que las personas usen la reputación de sus credenciales y obtengan los beneficios reales a lo largo de ella, por lo que es un protocolo importante para el mundo de la cadena de bloques porque está resolviendo los problemas sobre el estrés, por lo que ¿Cuál es la cadena de bloques el objetivo y el valor de la transmisión? Diría&nbsp;yo.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sí, sabes, creo que existe una relación sinérgica entre ONTO-id y o-score, realmente la forma en que se utilizan y, como dijiste, hay mucha flexibilidad en cómo se puede crear esa puntuación. Realmente me gusta lo que ha hecho Ontology con Wing porque realmente está demostrando que el futuro de DeFi, sabes que aún es tan temprano que no tiene que estar demasiado colateralizado, sabes que no es así como funciona el mundo real, tienes una reputación en el mundo real y esa reputación es lo que le permite tomar prestado correctamente y, por lo tanto, con o-score y en Wing como un ejemplo como el que mencionó Raindy, es solo para reiterar porque creo que es importante que luego pueda obtener mejores tasas ya sea que se trate de un préstamo con garantía insuficiente o de mejores incentivos, lo digo en serio, eso también depende del protocolo en el que se integran el puntaje en el sitio y el puntaje o, usted sabe que puede haber un caso de uso diferente.</p><p>Ejemplo… Veo que Alonso aquí en el chat es preguntar si los sistemas de fidelización del consumidor es un buen caso absolutamente, sabes que te imaginas ahora mismo sabes que en el mundo real tienes estas tarjetas de fidelización y cuántas tienes o tal vez tienes que descargar la aplicación y cada vez que vas tienes que escanear esto pero realmente es esto la mejor manera es que haya una manera de que pueda potencialmente llevar esa reputación a todas las diferentes tiendas y sitios web que conoce que visita, si lo hace, tal vez sea una representación más precisa de quién es usted sabe que va a cinco mercados y estás diciendo&nbsp;… bueno, quiero comprar las mismas cosas y voy a todas partes bien con ONTO-id con&nbsp;o-score.</p><p>Potencialmente esta información nuevamente esta es tu identidad tus datos depende de ti cuánto de esto quieres para compartir, digo que quiero compartir esta información con estos cinco proveedores y, a partir de ahí, ellos pueden dictar su lealtad y luego otorgarle recompensas basadas en esa cadena que conoce en el mundo real o en la que conoce en la web también, porque, por supuesto, la mayor parte del mundo se ha vuelto digital, por lo que la mayoría de nosotros compramos todas nuestras cosas en línea, definitivamente un caso de uso muy bueno para los airdrops, dice&nbsp;Liu.</p><p>Estoy preguntando absolutamente que sabes en términos de lanzamientos aéreos, tal vez Raindy, podrías hablar un poco sobre cómo se está utilizando hoy en&nbsp;día.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, y en realidad, el equipo está trabajando en el caso de uso relacionado con el lanzamiento aéreo con el ID de ONT, porque en el mundo de las criptomonedas, especialmente cuando el nuevo proyecto está lanzando los tokens, habrá lanzamientos aéreos masivos allí, así que lo que el equipo del proyecto puede decir es que saben que pueden evitar que los robots obtengan los lanzamientos aéreos de forma gratuita y que es un poco perjudicial para los usuarios reales y los miembros reales de la comunidad obtener las recompensas de una manera confiable, por lo que a través del sistema ONTid y lo llamaremos Al igual que lo hicieron, las soluciones SDK brindaron a los proyectos que estamos buscando formas de evaluar a todas las personas que participan en la dirección como acreditaciones y también en función de sus retiros anteriores en la cadena, por lo que es una especie de solución de los problemas y sus inquietudes, no estoy en ese caso porque Gloria, nuestra jefa de líderes de desarrollo de ecosistemas, está liderando los proyectos, así que creo que podemos guardar esas preguntas en nuestras notas y buscaremos información más detallada con ella y le daremos las respuestas directamente.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sí, creo que es algo genial, reo que una de las cosas valiosas de eventos como este es que recibimos preguntas que, aunque no somos la persona técnica o no tenemos toda la información, podemos usar esto para asegurarnos. que podemos ayudar a continuar educando a la comunidad sobre todos estos casos de uso particulares e incluso algunos de los que ya estamos explorando, tal vez solo para tocar los lanzamientos aéreos un poco, ya sabes, en una de las llamadas que he alojado en la ClubHouse.</p><p>Alguien dio un muy buen ejemplo y sabes que UNI lanzó Uniswap por airdrop, debería decir que UNI lanzó a toda su base de usuarios, pero sabes una de las cosas, una de las preguntas que nos hacemos en términos de que sabes la forma en que se distribuyó frente a tal vez si hubieran usado algún tipo de solución de identidad es si una persona hubiera usado 10 billeteras y una persona solo usó una billetera, ¿cree usted que es justo que la distribución se envió de manera justa porque una persona obtuvo mucho más que otra? Es decir, porque no saben que está mal que esté usando 10 billeteras diferentes, pero ahora la distribución de esa riqueza de esa ficha no es justa, no es por persona, ahora va a las billeteras correctamente, así que si realmente queremos busque formas de crear una distribución más justa de estos&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Potencialmente, podemos buscar soluciones como ONT-id para asegurarnos de que lo estamos enviando a personas reales correctamente y cómo verificamos que estas personas son reales. Quiero decir, si descarga ONTO, puede ver que hay formas de&nbsp;hacerlo.</p><p>En la verificación social, también puede hacerlo a través de algunos métodos de verificación estrictos que utilizan el elemento KYC que conoce, por lo que ciertamente hay muchas formas diferentes en que podemos hacer esto y usted sabe que lo realmente bueno es que hay muchas áreas que pueden ser explorado con identidad.</p> SAGA <p>Humpty<br> Bueno, estamos redondeando bien, somos todos, casi hemos estado aquí una hora Raindy, así que es fantástico, veamos si podemos terminar esta presentación.</p><p>Sé que Saga es algo que su equipo sabe que está desarrollando actualmente y explorando casos de uso para que pueda darnos un resumen muy rápido, qué es Saga y por qué es importante.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, Saga es un mercado de datos descentralizado que está diseñado tanto para individuos como para empresas, así que lo que estamos haciendo ahora es eso, recuerdo que un miembro de la comunidad mencionó que cuál es su comprensión de la saga es la pulgada de esos datos, por lo que es realmente impresionante porque obtuvo la idea principal, tan recientemente que en la mayoría de los casos en torno a los activos digitales, es por eso que tenemos tantas, muchas plataformas DeFi, pero en realidad tenemos los requisitos y preguntamos sobre los datos en largo plazo, esa es la razón por la que acumulamos datos y, como presentamos antes, Ontology es una cadena de bloques no solo para la identidad descentralizada sino también para los datos y el ONTid es uno de los elementos importantes del proyecto.</p><p>Entonces, ahora puedes iniciar sesión en el sitio web de Saga, ya está en vivo como por el año&nbsp;pasado.</p><p>Por lo tanto, puede intentar iniciar sesión con su ONT-id y comenzar a obtener los datos enumerados en el sitio web, pero a largo plazo vamos a construir más que eso, por lo que será un mercado de datos verdaderamente descentralizado, debería construirse en la Cadena de Ontology, pero será más interesante con la otra oportunidad, así que esa es la idea y hacer que este mercado sea más útil que la idea es que vamos a obtener más casos de uso que es el uso de la lógica de las plataformas de Saga y hacer el lanzamiento oficial en una etapa posterior para estar completamente preparados y mostrar nuestro profesionalismo y también el respeto a los antiguos usuarios, por lo tanto no nos queremos apresurar y mejor prestar más atención a los detalles para tenerlo mejor y más preparado.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sí, eso es fantástico, quiero decir, creo que lo que está haciendo Ontology es crear un ecosistema muy completo para la identidad y los datos correctos, si tiene su identidad digital, tiene su puntaje de crédito digital, tiene, debería decir, puntaje de crédito descentralizado, identidad descentralizada. tiene la integración de DeFi, que es la siguiente diapositiva a la que vamos a llegar con Wing, tiene la billetera que le permite utilizar todo este ecosistema, desde la creación de su identidad hasta la utilización de estos protocolos DeFi y potencialmente en el futuro utilizando SAGA, que es este mercado descentralizado.</p> WING <p>Humpty<br> Entonces, Wing la primera plataforma de préstamos de DeFi de cadena cruzada basada en crédito que es una gran realidad, básicamente la plataforma de préstamos tiene grupos flash tradicionales, actualmente es de cadena cruzada porque actualmente está en Ontology, está en Ethereum y en OKchain, que era lanzado recientemente el creo que hace una semana o&nbsp;dos.</p><p>El tiempo vuela, recuerdo que estábamos anunciando que era tan emocionante y luego lo interesante o el elemento único de esta plataforma es porque Ontology ha desarrollado estas tecnologías enfocadas en la identidad descentralizada, fueron capaces de crear, supongo que como un campo de pruebas de cómo eso podría funcionar y eso es derecho inclusivo.</p><p>Hablamos antes en términos de préstamos garantizados, mejores recompensas, lo cual es genial y creo que si saben que el futuro de DeFi será este, cuanto más escucho a la gente hablar sobre este tema en Twitter en Clubhouse. Sé que en YouTube, una variedad de canales de medios, la gente está viendo que actualmente la forma en que se construye DeFi no es justa, solo beneficia a aquellos que están&nbsp;contigo.</p><p>Conoces mucha riqueza, la palabra que veo que se usa mucho como plutocracia, lo que significa que tú tiene una tonelada más de dinero, entonces su voz cuenta más y sabe realmente lo que blockchain crypto está tratando de resolver es realmente ir en contra de muchas de estas formas tradicionales de cómo funciona la economía y quiere ser más justo y creo que con la Introducción de identidades y puntajes crediticios descentralizados.</p><p>Existe la posibilidad de aprovechar su comportamiento, su reputación para poder acceder a estos mercados sin tener necesariamente esta gran cantidad de activos digitales que usted conoce para poder respaldar eso préstamo.</p> Comunidad Ontology <p>Humpty<br> Entonces, creo que estamos casi al final de nuestra presentación aquí, Raindy, ¿quieres hacer algunos comentarios finales en términos de que conoces Ontology y este ecosistema tan&nbsp;rico?</p><p>Raindy <br>¡Si! Entonces, pienso a través de la charla de hoy y la presentación que la gente ya tuvo la idea de que lo que Ontology está haciendo, lo que estamos haciendo es enfocarnos en la identidad descentralizada que es lo primero y lo segundo son los datos, entonces, ¿Qué enumeramos en&nbsp;esto?</p><p>El gráfico de información muestra que lo que hemos logrado en este aspecto, pero más que eso, todavía estamos haciendo lo tradicional, como todos los proyectos de criptografía, estamos haciendo el ecosistema rico con todas las cadenas públicas, billeteras, proyectos e intercambios DeFi y también los otros protocolos y con el objetivo de construir palabras confiables con el esfuerzo de todos, para que pueda ver que ya hemos tenido comunidades de más de 29 idiomas y estamos presionando a nuestros socios a alrededor de 200, creo que debería ser más que eso recientemente y también hablando de la gobernabilidad, sabía que tenemos redes descentralizadas y globales de Ontology, como pueden ver, tenemos alrededor de 1.000 nodos en total y los 65 de ellos como nodos candidatos.</p><p>Por ende, incluso para los usuarios individuales que pueden apostar su ONT en cualquiera de los nodos y ganar ONG, la tarifa del gas es la que les da acceso para hacer transacciones en la cadena de Ontology y lo que es increíble es que ahora tenemos tantos ONT-ids creados en la Cadena de Ontología y es muy bueno ver que tanta gente tiene una identidad descentralizada a partir de Ontology, y espero que haya más personas que tengan sus ideas y datos que controlen por sí mismos a través de una manera descentralizada y Ontology seguirá esforzándose en estos aspectos y construyendo un mundo más confiable para&nbsp;todos.</p><p>Live session tomado de: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDojJAwTXhc">Ontology live session at Consensus 2021 by CoinDesk — YouTube</a></p><p>Traducido por:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/aidonker_x">aidonker</a></p><p>Encuentra mas en: <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology | A blockchain for self-sovereign ID and&nbsp;DATA</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/resumen-de-ontology-live-session-at-consensus-2021-by-coindesk-c668d5918061">Resumen de Ontology live session at Consensus 2021 by CoinDesk</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					  Nicht verpassen: Alles dreht sich um digitale Identitäten und den Einsatz von Vertrauensdiensten in der Praxis auf dem „eIDAS Summit“ des bitkom. Auf der virtuellen Hauptbühne spricht Dominik Deimel, Gründer von comuny, über “Föderierte Identitäten und Datensouveränität – ein Modell nicht nur für den Gesundheitsmarkt” (Bühne Vertrauensdienste in der Praxis, 11:50-12:10 Uhr, 15.06.2021). <p>Föderiertes Identitätsmanagement ist heute ein etablierter Standard, der es dem Nutzer erlaubt, mit seiner Identität verschiedenste Dienste im Sinne eines Single-Sign-On zu nutzen. Dieser Ansatz bedingt, dass ein Identitätsprovider (IDP) viele Informationen des Nutzers verarbeiten kann (Stichwort “Profilbildung”) gleichzeitig aber – in regulierten Märkten – einen hohen Aufwand für den Schutz persönlicher Daten betreiben muss. Dies gilt zum Beispiel für Krankenversicherer, die den Zugang zu Diensten der Telematikinfrastruktur wie ePA oder eRezept organisieren. Hier brauchen die Teilnehmer eines föderierten Netzwerks im Gesundheitsmarkt gegenseitige Kontrolle und Akzeptanz. Die Herausforderung in Zukunft: Der souveräne Umgang des Nutzers mit seinen Identitätsdaten in der eID Wallet auf dem Mobilgerät.</p><p>Im Vortrag wird die Architektur eines IDP vorgestellt, der Vorteile und Vorgaben von OIDC und eIDAS als etablierte Standards sowie die Prinzipien von Self Sovereign Identities zusammenbringt. Damit lässt sich sofort und ohne Blockchain Technologie das Mobilgerät als komfortabler Authenticator mit einer mobilen eID Wallet nutzen. Beide Seiten profitieren: Nutzer behalten die Hoheit über ihre sensiblen Daten, und Unternehmen erfüllen die hohen Auflagen von Datenschutz und eIDAS. Dieser Ansatz bietet ein Geschäftsmodell, welches sich sehr gut auf andere Märkte übertragen lässt und offen ist für Business mit weiteren technischen Lösungspartnern und Integratoren.</p><p>#bitkom #eIDAS21 #comuny #Vertrauensdienste #DigitalIdentity #MyDataOperator #verifizierung #authentifizierung #operator #trinity</p><p>Virtuelle Konferenz des Digitalverbands Deutschlands mit branchenübergreifendem Austausch, über 1.000 Expertinnen und Experten, #Tech-Trends, <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=insights&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=insights&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160">#Insights</a> &amp; <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=bestpractices&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=bestpractices&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160">#BestPractices</a> zur sicheren Digitalisierung von Prozessen.</p><p>Anmeldung und kostenfreie Tickets unter <a href="https://www.eidas-summit.de/de">https://www.eidas-summit.de/de</a> und mehr über den Ansatz von comuny <a href="https://www.comuny.de/produkt/">mehr über den Ansatz von comuny</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The growing degree of digitization and the ever-increasing online transactions has necessitated a strong and secure way to identify and authenticate digital entities. This has led to the emergence of Digital Identity Management, where digital documents that prove the identity of an entity are stored and shared digitally.</p><p>While there are many components in digital identity management, in this article, we will talk about a central component called identity&nbsp;wallets.</p> What’s an Identity&nbsp;Wallet? <p>An identity wallet is a digital wallet/storage where you can safely store your digitized documents and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>, and share them easily with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>You own this wallet and its contents, so you have the power to decide how and with whom you want to share your credentials. This concept of always being in charge of your identity is called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and it is one of the pillars of web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>So, how can this identity wallet be beneficial for you and why should you embrace&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here are five reasons why we think identity wallets are the&nbsp;future.</p> Reason #1: Keeps your Data&nbsp;Safe <p>One of the biggest issues facing the digital age is cyberattacks and the resultant <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-id-theft-what-happens-when-your-identity-stolen.html">identity&nbsp;theft</a>.</p><p>If you analyze identity thefts and their patterns, you’ll notice that hackers steal millions of identities from a single storage/database, and often, the owner of the identity would know of the theft only much later, and sometimes, may not know it at&nbsp;all!</p><p>But what happens when you do away with a central repository where all the data is stored and replace it with a decentralized form of storage where each entity stores its data separately?</p><p>It becomes that much harder for someone to steal data because it requires considerable effort to steal just one record, which is not tenable in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>To top it all, the owner is in complete control of the data at all times, so identity theft may not even be possible in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>In all, your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">data is&nbsp;safe</a>.</p> Reason #2: Know Where Your Data is&nbsp;Used <p>Surveys and opinion polls overwhelmingly show that users are concerned about their privacy and want to know how and where their data is stored and&nbsp;used.</p><p>For example, a <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/2020/consumer-data-report-kpmg.pdf">survey by KPMG</a> shows that data privacy is a concern for 97% of U.S consumers and almost 54% worry about what companies do with their data. Likewise, the Eurobarometer survey states that 72% of users want to know how their data is processed.</p><p>These numbers clearly show that users will feel more comfortable when they know where their data is stored and how it is&nbsp;used.</p><p>The good news with identity wallets is that you control the entire data sharing process, so there’s no concern about how someone else can use your&nbsp;data.</p><p>You can choose to send <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">only the relevant data</a> to entities for processing. For example, if you have to prove your age, just send your date of birth credential without including other details such as your address or government ID. That’s how granular you can get with data sharing and its&nbsp;usage.</p> Reason #3: Meets Mandatory Compliance Requirements <p>The European Parliament and Council implemented the eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication, and trust Services) regulation in 2014 and paved the way for greater digital security. The more recent <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity</a> further empowers users to store their identities in a digital wallet and use it seamlessly where needed, even across boundaries.</p><p>Such forward-looking regulations are likely to be adopted by other countries as well, so before long, having an identity wallet can become a way of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Why not jump on the bandwagon early and proactively meet the required <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">compliance</a> requirements?</p><p>This way, you can enjoy its benefits early&nbsp;on.</p> Reason #4: Facilitates Quick and Easy Authentication <p>Besides keeping your credentials safe, an identity wallet can facilitate quick, easy, and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">hassle-free authentication</a>.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">opening a bank account </a>in a different country doesn’t have to entail the collection and submission of a ton of documents that could take weeks to process. With digital credentials stored in an identity wallet, the entire process can be completed in a few minutes because all that you have to do is share it electronically.</p><p>The concerned bank authorities can verify the data and open an account for you. That’s how easy it can&nbsp;be!</p> Reason #5: Perform a Wide Range of Tasks Electronically <p>As more businesses accept identity wallets, it won’t be long before you can share the pertinent information in your identity wallets with a wide range of online services.</p><p>Some possible tasks you can do with an identity wallet&nbsp;are:</p>  Prove that you’re 18+ years of age to buy alcohol or enter a&nbsp;bar  Share your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">past employment</a> and educational qualifications with prospective employers  Use it as a <a href="https://www.safetravel.affinidi.com/">health passport</a> for travel or to buy the prescribed medicines in any part of the&nbsp;world.  <p>Here are some more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world ideas</a> where an identity wallet can come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>Undoubtedly, identity wallets are an integral part of the future as it comes with a ton of benefits geared for the next-gen online security.</p><p>So, are you ready to use an identity wallet and leverage the many benefits that come with&nbsp;it?</p><p>Already, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">European Union</a> has set things in motion as it plans to create a digital identity wallet that will securely store payment details, passwords, digital documents, and PII of individuals from all the 27 member nations, so the same can be used when needed across a wide range of public and private online services.</p><p>To leverage this trend, Affinidi offers APIs and SDKs to create a secure identity wallet to store your verifiable credentials.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint was released mid-June to help shape the development of a cohesive but decentralized method of issuing, holding, and verifying the results of a COVID status test. The Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) is an open and publicly funded collaborative; it was founded by <a href="https://id2020.org/" title="ID2020">ID2020</a> and the working group is managed by the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/" title="Trust over IP Foundation">Trust over IP Foundation</a>. The <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/" title="blueprint">blueprint</a>, which is now available for public comment, lays out the most important and intentional design choices as well as recommendations to implement an interoperable and inclusive system.</p>
 Intentional design choices 
<p>The Good Health Pass outlines their recommended architecture aspects:</p>
 
 Individuals should be in control of their data: This goes on to describe the relationship between the issuer of a credential (a test center) and the holder of a credential (the individual being tested), as well as the relationship between the holder and a verifier (entity that checks the credential before granting access to a service, such as airport staff, border control, etc.). It is explicitly stated that there is no room for a third party in these interactions – the holder should interact directly with anyone needing to issue or verify their credential. It recommends being restrictive by design with privacy by default. To enable this, the blueprint chooses to use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" title="W3C Verifiable Credentials">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> as a standard for interoperability, which also allows for selective disclosure of credentials. 
 Equity and Inclusion: There are concerns around tracking the health status of individuals and using it as a gatekeeper to accessing private and public services, and rightly so. When equal access to basic rights are sidelined in favor of promoting mobility, there are risks that some groups will be marginalized. It must be remembered that vaccines are not universally available. Therefore, a negative test must also suffice to allow equal access to services. Thus the name of a credentialing service is important. It should not be called a vaccine passport because it is misleading and would clearly create a barrier to services for large populations who do not have access or choose not to receive a vaccine. It is recommended to be called a “digital health pass”. Access also includes device and offline access. Although a smartphone is the preferred channel for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials, there must be an offline version for those who do not have a smartphone. QR codes on a hard copy credential can fulfill this, with multiple QR codes for different selective disclosure scenarios. 
 Decentralized for security and scalability: This blueprint argues that a decentralized approach boost security of holding and exchanging PII. This argument is made in more detail in <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80301/demystifying-the-blockchain-what-makes-a-blockchain-useful-to-a-firm/" title="other resources">other resources</a>. In terms of scalability, the GHPC explains that a decentralized digital health pass could reduce stress and traffic between healthcare information systems by shifting the work of issuing and verifying credentials to other parties, but the scalability of the decentralized ecosystems is not addressed. The scalability of decentralized ecosystems is still a relatively open question, with widely varying results based on the particular public/private/consortium blockchain arrangement used. 
 Open Standards for interoperability and participation: without a doubt, open standards must be followed so that a credential issued at one test center can be accepted at any verifier. The GHPC insists on a pragmatic and phased approach to designing and implementing. While that has led to a well-thought-out blueprint, it is already late to meeting real-world needs. In many countries, the initial rollback of lockdown measures has already occurred, and the reopening of economies means that systems to prove a negative COVID status have already been implemented in a disjointed way. The solutions that are out there many times provide a verifiable certificate, but can be missing other elements such as decentralization, the ability to certify a self-test without a smartphone, or the ability to just use one app for different testing stations. Decentralized systems also face a challenge of unified communication – already a trend in regional vs. federal measures where individuals may find it difficult to find reliable information that does not conflict with other sources. However, the systems in place are less than perfect but they do function to a limited degree and may disincentivize local governments from redesigning their initiatives based on the GHPC’s recommendations. 
 
<p></p>
 Identity Verification as a Foundation 
<p>Among the recommendations offered by the GHPC, binding the holder's identity with their credential is important to ensure that the credential does indeed belong to the holder. This lines up with the rising use of identity verification to accompany onboarding and authentication for higher security. Offline testing and credential issuance may rely on a manual check of a photo ID, but this does not last beyond the time of verification. Binding an identity to a Verifiable Credential remains valid beyond the point of verification by being able to match a real-time biometric data point with one which was logged at the point of verification – checking that a fingerprint matches the one which was logged when the credential was issued, for example. When using decentralized architectures, identity verification can still provide high and/or selective privacy for the holder while assuring the issuer or verifier that the credential can be trusted.</p>
<p>While the GHCP’s blueprint is well designed and offers concrete recommendations for a functional yet privacy-centric solution with implementation recommendations for 30, 90, and 180 day intervals, it comes late in the game and may face reluctance from public players. GHCP may also have limited the potential for its own adoption by relying on a decentralized architecture only, instead of building interoperability for health passes already in circulation. However, this may be the chance that decentralized identity has needed to demonstrate its efficacy on a global level. KuppingerCole will continue researching this market segment, as it has high potential to positively disrupt digital identity management for the individual as well as for the enterprise.</p>

<p>Companies today manage and maintain master data from business partners in multiple instances in various in-house IT systems — and do the same with their own master data in thirdparty systems. Each company has to invest a great deal of time and money in ensuring this data is of good quality. This is due to the high number of data sets created in the process — which amount to several million in the case of major corporations. In addition to this, suppliers have to submit hundreds of certificates year after year to customers such as car manufacturers. Sustainability certificates have recently become increasingly important, too. In practice, this usually results in a considerable amount of manual work on both sides that is very time consuming and prone to errors. The team responsible for the strategic advance engineering project “Economy of Things” (EoT) at Bosch Research is working with partners on an innovative concept that aims to tackle these very issues.</p>

			 Are Banks Missing Out on the Digital Money Revolution?<br>
 
<p>Digitalization continues to accelerate our everyday life, affecting people, businesses, governments and financial institutions. The Covid-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst that revolutionized the way people work, purchase, and invest. The hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) is evidence of the growing interest in investment opportunities brought by blockchain technology.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/security-tokens-growth-europe-cryptocurrencies?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bytj_o0CGsKv2t4Rzt2IJOjWe7Nzu2IM84T_XwAmnsDzl310A0Cwk9sAwuwGXzrPx9urm">According to a recent report</a>,&nbsp;security tokens are seen as the next blockchain wave&nbsp;and are predicted to reach a market of €918 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>Naturally, the demand for these new means of investment has pushed digital money into the spotlight. Why? Because&nbsp;the cash leg must be on the same infrastructure as the securities&nbsp;in order to allow a real transition to a decentralized network. While most banks are still waiting for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to show the way, stablecoins issued by crypto players have reached a record-high trading volume at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bytj_o0CGsKv2t4Rzt2IJOjWe7Nzu2IM84T_XwAmnsDzl310A0Cwk9sAwuwGXzrPx9urm">$766.02 billion in May</a>, up 51.9% from the previous month, and nearly 15x greater than one year ago.</p>
<p>CBDC&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Commercial bank digital money&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Stablecoins:</p>
<p>First, let’s take a deeper look at the two forms of money in the current banking system: central bank money and commercial bank money. Central bank money is made available to the public in the form of cash and to commercial banks in the form of central bank reserves. Private money is deposited into commercial banks, and banks are required to hold a certain percentage of these deposits at the central bank as a cushion. The rest of the deposits are used to grant loans to individuals and companies, where commercial bank money is created at this point. Therefore,&nbsp;in traditional finance, commercial banks act like trusted entities&nbsp;to not only provide essential services to customers, but also help create capital and liquidity in the market.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Similarly, stablecoins require promise and credibility, and they must be interchangeable with existing forms of money, in other words, they have to be anchored. This means stablecoins require users to have the same level of confidence as commercial bank money. Therefore,&nbsp;in onchain finance, commercial banks must take this role of trusted issuer of tokenized cash&nbsp;as they are the most suitable entities to issue stablecoins anchored by fiat money. They have already missed the ecommerce revolution to payment giants such as Stripe, Adyen, and Alipay, and have lost significant retail market share to neobanks. Will this happen again in the digital currency revolution?</p>
<p>Banks are at a critical juncture for catching up with this new wave. If they don’t act quickly, they will be seriously disrupted. With the emergence of crypto players such as Circle (which just reraised $440M), Paxos (which is now a bank), and our partner Monerium (a fiat-eMoney payment gateway for security token investors),&nbsp;the race is already on to become the tokenized money provider for digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-- The Garden of Forking Paths, Jorge Luis Borges</p>
<p>The pre-technological world was already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">networked</a>. No material object and no idea has ever stood alone—"no man is an island". Language itself is a network of associations shared between a group of people. The question of technology is: how do we bring our web of associations into the realm of computers? The legacy internet has focused on social networks almost exclusively—our mammalian brains readily took to this, we all love to <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/robin-hanson/">signal</a>. But before “social media” there was something called hypertext: a seemingly modest way to connect documents shared between computers.</p>
<p>A footnote in a book used to require a library, locating the referenced book, and finding the cited page (which might have footnotes itself)! Hypertext allows one to traverse a network quickly and easily with just mouse clicks, making information accessible to those without the time and resources to hunt down physical artifacts. Urbit’s “%graph-store” is not the same as hypertext but it does bear some familial resemblances. Fundamentally, %graph-store is a data structure that can accommodate disparate data types within a single edifice. It is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph databases</a> and recent implementations such as <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>. To understand this data structure it is worth diving into the origins of hypertext—the original linked network.</p>
<p>The story of hypertext begins at the end of WWII with an article in The Atlantic that proposed to extend the human mind via machine. Vannevar Bush had seen first-hand the explosion of electronics manufacturing and scientific knowledge, recognizing the great peril and opportunity of such a revolution. His <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">description</a> of the Memex presaged the technological world of today, envisioning a personal device that would allow the user to draw upon a vast library of information, and link documents together arbitrarily—what he called "associative indexing"—a deliberate recreation of how the mind connects thoughts.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw the first implementations of these ideas. Ted Nelson's <a href="https://archive.org/details/SelectedPapers1977/page/n15/mode/2up">writing</a> around Project Xanadu elaborated this linking between documents into what Nelson called hypertext. Nelson imagined "a text arranged in a graph structure", centered around a corpus arranged in nonlinear sequence, manipulable by author or audience. The concept was first demonstrated in 1968, at Douglas Engelbart's 'Mother of all Demos', where a vision of computers as a collaborative social environment was revealed to the world. "<a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/137/#7">The Journal</a>", presented alongside other revolutionary demos, exhibited collaboratively edited documents with hyperlinked connections. Any time-travellers in the audience would have immediately recognized the first webpage. From here, the idea of a linked network of documents would be developed through successive phases of computing, from the mainframe to the PC.</p>
<p>Experimentation with these ideas continued through the 1970s and 80s. A team directed by Andy Lippman at MIT extended the concept to threaded visual hypermedia with the Aspen Movie Map, a user-directed virtual tour of Aspen, Colorado. Hypertext and hypermedia gained a mass audience for the first time with HyperCard, a program that shipped with Mac computers. Users were able to collect or create '<a href="https://archive.org/details/hypercardstacks">stacks</a>' of interlinked cards; a personal body of text, art, and knowledge could be accrued and modified, or shared with others—though not yet with native networking capabilities. </p>
<p>With the World Wide Web, hypertext achieved escape velocity. Initially a one-man <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">project</a>, the world wide web was similar to Bush’s vision of the Memex—a way to share, index, and connect information between individuals and groups. The web succeeded by utilizing the physical infrastructure already available: PCs with graphical interfaces, DNS, and the internet. Critically, its method of transmitting and traversing texts was a standardized protocol, allowing a free body of information to assemble atop the new infrastructure by anyone willing to learn the tools. A new frontier was cleared and cultivated with open standards, but it would gradually face enclosure.</p>
<p>In the following decade, after the first wave of social networking sites had crested but before phones became the primary web clients, Twitter was launched. Originally an awkward bridge between SMS and the web, its design eventually coalesced around static identity, posts with chronological sorting, and interlinked post threads. These simple primitives spawned a vast corpus of information, a graph-of-graphs intertwined and overlapped, mapping an entire platonic world. Twitter is fundamentally constrained by its very nature: it is the walled garden of an advertising company. The financial incentives of the server operators demanded seizure of the commons and the replacement of standardized protocols with proprietary databases.</p>
<p>As the first networked services withered, a new critique was implicitly articulated in the construction of a <a href="https://moronlab.blogspot.com/2010/01/urbit-functional-programming-from.html">new kind of abstract machine</a>. Urbit learned from the past: tightly defined protocols, baked-in cryptography, and decentralization were key. If power over the network was determined by those who ran the servers, then we would run the servers ourselves. </p>
<p>Urbit is not fundamentally a hypertext system; it is a new kind of computer, designed to participate in a peer-to-peer network that rejects the client-server model. All Urbit software takes its networking model for granted, it is not an ad-hoc layering of mismatched abstractions. Fundamental design decisions determine the trajectory of the future.</p>
<p>Early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j">implementations</a> of graph databases and projects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> hit on the same core idea: linked data needs its own data structure. In 2020 Urbit OS adopted an application called %graph-store that made use of a new, native <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Gwfg442kV3cdfG7NnWPEf2TMa3uLUTAKkZD70ALZkE/edit">data structure</a> which would act as a database service for social applications. Chats, long-form text, and other types of data produced in the course of social computing now share the same tent, a single structure extensible to new types of content. Each item added to it is a node in a personal graph—a tree that grows branches as your computer communicates. These nodes can be linked arbitrarily to other graphs—Urbit's global immutable namespace grants both permanence and ownership and allows the graph’s branches to intertwine with others. Graphs can accommodate a variety of content, from simple text, to code and media yet to be conceived. You own your graph, and it is a record of your digital journey with others.</p>
<p>Personal hypertext graphs are leaving behind proprietary platforms and gaining independence. Graphs until now have been used as tools of surveillance and marketing, but they are being reclaimed and sewn back into the network, each bound to the cryptographic identity of an individual, permanent computer. Where the map of your life was once splintered across a thousand systems and held in the custody of strangers, it is now possessed only by you and shared only as you see fit. On Urbit, an infinite forest of digital lives can take root, nesting their boughs and stalks.</p>

<p>The team at Dock has taken another step towards providing secure, decentralized credential solutions by transitioning our testnet to a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) algorithm. We have kicked off this testing phase by successfully onboarding a number of candidate validators to the network, and will transition our current PoA mainnet to PoS as well once the security audit and testing activities are successfully completed, which is expected to happen by the end of June 2021.</p><p>What is Proof of Stake?</p><p>Proof of Stake (PoS) refers to an algorithm in which the validators are selected on a blockchain based on the amount of tokens they have staked. Validators are entities who are charged with the important tasks of producing blocks (hence processing blockchain transactions) and validating the blocks that are produced by other validators. </p><p>In PoS, validators are selected based on how many Dock tokens have been staked (locked up) in support of each candidate. Before validators are selected, candidate validators can stake their own tokens, and/or be backed by other token holders (“nominators”) who stake their tokens on the candidates’ behalf, and receive rewards if the candidates get selected and start producing blocks. Once the nomination period is over, the algorithm automatically selects the candidates with the largest stakes to become validators. The validators are incentivized to perform their duties properly, as the staked tokens can be slashed (taken away) in case of validator misbehavior.</p><p>This is distinct from the approach taken in Proof of Authority (PoA) - the algorithm currently used on the Dock mainnet. In PoA, validators are trustworthy entities selected by the Dock Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to overseeing the Dock network.</p><p>The transition to PoS takes the validator selection decisions away from a single entity (Dock Association) and distributes it across a network of nominators and validators, hence creating more decentralized power and greater security in the network.</p><p>An Open Network for Everyone</p><p>The transition to PoS also comes with further democratization of the network governance structure. Some of the governance for our current PoA mainnet is centralized to the Governing Council, as the Council members are the only ones who can vote on any changes to the network proposed by the Council or token holders. Once the mainnet transitions to PoS, however, Dock token holders will be able to vote on proposed changes to the network (including election of Council members) by locking up their tokens. This change, along with the ability for token holders to earn passive income by staking on behalf of successful validators, enhances the utility of the Dock tokens.</p><p>Participation by token holders as validators, nominators, and voters is made possible by the fact that the Dock network is a permissionless blockchain. This is unlike many of our competitors who leverage permissioned blockchains, and hence limit the access to their blockchain governance to the select few. It is part of Dock’s vision to build a network that has maximum participation and widespread adoption, and we believe that this can only be achieved through decentralization, democracy, and transparency offered by a public blockchain that is open for all token holders, and free from the control of a single entity.</p><p>What’s Next?</p><p>We will be running the PoS testnet for the next few weeks to ensure that all network features work correctly. During this time we will also work with <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a>, a team of security experts currently performing an audit on the PoS network, to ensure that the network is safe and secure. Once these steps are completed we will transition our mainnet to PoS as well. More posts will follow to keep the community posted on our progress and further explain the changes introduced in PoS.</p>

<p>In its latest Digital Signature report, Gartner identified InfoCert as a “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, ranking it among the leaders of the Digital Signature industry.</p>



<p>The consulting firm has served as an authoritative IT advisor for over 40 years. Recently, it released its eSignature market guide, “Market Guide for Electronic Signature”, a true reference for IT and technology solutions professionals and companies. Gartner’s report put InfoCert among the top providers of Digital Signature solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://infocert.digital/analyst-reports/the-gartners-market-guide-for-electronic-signature/">Download the report published by Gartner, free of charge, to see how the digital signature market has evolved and the main global players like InfoCert have performed</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Gartner’s analysis is intended to guide professionals and businesses in assessing the solutions available on the market offered by providers in the field of Digital Signature and Trust Services. Gartner’s report divides Digital Signature and Trust Service providers into three categories. It assigned InfoCert to the “Full Service, enterprise electronic and Digital signature platform” category, which includes firms able to provide highly flexible technological and process services that offer all the technological characteristics required to meet the needs of large, medium and small companies, and even individual citizens.</p>



<p>The report is very useful because it classifies providers according to their specific capabilities and the levels of service they offer. It is an excellent source from which to analyse the latest B2B, B2C and B2E Use Cases. The report also provides a detailed view of the latest “Assurance” requirements (i.e., compliance with the standards established by European reference regulations) and technology requirements – aspects to which companies should pay special attention if they intend to embark on a path of Digital Transformation.</p>



<p>The “Full-service, enterprise electronic and Digital signature platform” segment, in which InfoCert has been recognised as a sector leader, includes Providers that adapt best to their clients’ every need. In fact, according to Gartner, these providers are able to support simple, advanced and qualified electronic signatures, they can include industry-specific processes in their Enterprise solutions, and they are able to offer “out-of-the-box” solutions that can be integrated with third-party platforms and software such as document, HCMs, CRMs and CLMs. They also support API integration, identity verification and knowledge-base verification tools.</p>



<p>The report also analyses the other two supplier categories: “Stand-alone, workflow-focused, click-to-sign electronic signature platform” and “Enterprise digital signature providers”.</p>



<p>The Gartner team of analysts that prepared the report highlights that clients must have access to services that match their needs, their geographical areas (often characterised by different regulatory requirements) and the use case they take as reference. This is why it is essential that clients be able to choose the vendor that best meets their functionality and compliance criteria at every stage of the process.</p>

This secures against criminals; however, it can’t ensure protection against keylogging hardware or software.</p><p>Always remember your&nbsp;Passcode</p><p>You must ensure you always remember the password, or your digital assets or funds will be lost forever. In contrast to your bank, there are exceptionally restricted password recovery alternatives with Bitcoin. Indeed, you ought to have the option to recollect your secret phrase even after years even if the account is not in use. It is recommended to keep a paper duplicate of your passcode in a safe space like a&nbsp;vault.</p><p>Keep a robust&nbsp;Passcode</p><p>Any passcode that contains just letters or guessable words can be considered frail and simple to break. A robust password consists of letters, numbers, special characters and should be at least 16 characters in length. The most secure passwords are those created by programs planned explicitly for this. Strong passwords are generally harder to recall, so you should take care in retaining them.</p><p>We are starting soon, and we won’t mind you stalking our social media for constant and swift&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/GetSafle">https://twitter.com/GetSafle</a></p><p>LinkedIn — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-safle">https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-safle</a></p><p>Facebook — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getsafleofficial">https://www.facebook.com/getsafleofficial</a></p><p>Instagram- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/getsafle/">https://www.instagram.com/getsafle/</a></p>

<p>Building a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private&nbsp;yards</p> Summary Rémi Müller — Unsplash<p>Lawns are a desert in biodiversity, yet they are still the default landscaping approach across Canada. In the region of Montreal alone, lawns cover a surface 317 times the Mount-Royal Park. In the United States, it is the largest irrigated crop. Transforming the culture of perfectly manicured lawns therefore represents an enormous opportunity for collective climate&nbsp;action.</p><p>One of the most devastating causes and impacts of climate change is the global decline in biodiversity. Beyond the development of public policies, legislative strategies and financial incentives, it is essential to increase the capacity for on-the-ground action among individuals and communities through the development of ecological gardening on residential yards. This strategy aims to create spaces that can enrich and support biodiversity and, by doing so, transform our relationship with Nature right at home. This effort involves helping people see that the land they own is part of a larger ecosystem that requires nourishment and care; the land they own is a common responsibility.</p><p>To achieve this ambitious goal, there is a critical need to develop tools that bring together all the available knowledge about ecological gardening in order to inspire and help residents take action; to legitimize the adoption of this new residential landscape aesthetics of biodiversity by creating a community of interest and practice; and to document and measure the socio-environmental benefits of these local actions at different scales in order to sustain the movement and provide municipal authorities with necessary tools and information to incorporate biodiversity and climate mitigation into landscape planning decisions.</p>Pilot project, summer 2020 — Vivant &amp; Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins<p><a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins / New Neighbors</a> aims precisely at developing a platform bringing together different functions (pedagogical, actionable, evaluational, financial, regulatory, etc.) to support and accelerate this socio-ecological transition through the aggregation of residential and commercial yards. It is about establishing the foundations of a movement that proposes a new form of cohabitation between Nature and us, one yard at a time, across urban, suburban and rural divides. <a href="http://www.nouveauxvoisins.org">www.nouveauxvoisins.org</a> is meant to be a platform for informing communities, transforming grass into habitats rich in biodiversity, and mapping and measuring the impacts of a movement already gaining momentum.</p><p>This blog summarizes the case studies and the paper prototype of a platform developed thanks to the generous contribution of <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/">The McConnell Foundation</a> as part of the Transition Catalyst Fund, and was done in collaboration with Nouveaux voisins, Dark Matter Labs and S. Karthik Mukkavilli.</p> Context <p>While the impacts of climate change are increasingly disrupting our lives, the potential climate strategies that individuals and communities can deploy often remain abstract.</p><p>Beyond the actions themselves, the impacts of these practices on climate change at the local and global scales has also been&nbsp;unclear.</p><p>In this context, it is essential to support, document and measure the contribution of citizen actions in order to make them visible and encourage public authorities to support those initiatives.</p> How could a platform be designed to coordinate citizen engagement and scientific knowledge in order to inspire collective action?  What are the necessary functions and structures of a platform that coordinates citizen engagement and scientific knowledge in order to inspire collective action?  Case studies <p>The first step in this research was to identify certain rewilding initiatives that could inspire the development of the Nouveaux Voisins platform — and inform the relationship between citizen science and remote sensing&nbsp;tools.</p><p>These case studies were selected to represent different dimensions of the Nouveaux Voisins project (e.g., type of ecological actions, citizen involvement, use of technological tools,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>Following an initial search for international initiatives, 8 initiatives were selected. Following an initial analysis, these initiatives were classified into 4 main categories.</p><p>These case studies have highlighted certain key&nbsp;lessons:</p> Opportunities <p>Economies of care: While access to native plants and ecological gardening services has been identified as a barrier, encouraging a demand for rewilding resources can stimulate a respective shift in supply. This coordinated move towards a local market for native plants and ecological landscaping services can be the beginning of an economy of care and conservation.</p><p>Facilitating civic contracts between citizens, non-humans, and governments: Assembling small-scale citizen observations of local habitat at the landscape level can help gauge the impact of biodiversity on ecological services and public health. This insight can drive government and community programs that circle back to the needs of non-human beings (prioritizing habitat corridors) and citizens (funding for gardening projects, equal access to&nbsp;nature).</p><p>Fostering agency: Clarifying the links between small-scale practices and larger scale impacts can help reframe individual action as collective effort.</p> Challenges <p>Integrating equity and access: Ensuring environmental surveying is accessible to various publics and providing multiple channels for citizens to voice their experiences to their governments and communities. This challenge may call for citizen science toolkits, direct communication pathways between citizens and municipalities, community-building channels, and public events that value the stewardship of citizens unable to take part in gardening at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Respecting local specificity while pursuing common goals: Building in flexible strategies that respond to various ecological regions, community contexts, and individual constraints while navigating commitments and lessons at larger&nbsp;scales.</p><p>Deployment at scale: Assembling collective habitat from small-scale transformations and decentralized citizen observations depends on the engagement of many. Nevertheless, these case studies have highlighted the possibility for surprising collaborations to pursue overlapping goals such as public health and education.</p> Based on these lessons, how can we build a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private yards&nbsp;? <p>From what we learned from the case studies and the Service Blueprint, we decided to organize the platform design around five categories of&nbsp;actions:</p><blockquote>Informing<br>Transforming<br>Mapping &amp; Measuring<br>Modeling &amp; Visualizing<br>Coordinating and Influencing</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins</a> is intended to be a platform that consolidates various features; it provides information, assists in the concrete transformation of grassed areas, maps and measures the impacts of collective actions, and helps visualize possible&nbsp;futures.</p><p>Moreover, all the data collected will help mobilize communities wishing to promote biodiversity by helping them coordinate and influence different actors in their environment.</p><p>See below some early sketches of what it could look&nbsp;like:</p> Next steps <p>Currently, Nouveaux voisins is continuing its on the ground pilot projects with Vivant, while <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> continues to develop a full suite of deep code innovations in support of nature based solutions with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">Trees as Infrastructure</a> and other initiatives.</p><p>For this specific platform project, we are currently defining the minimum viable prototype and are looking for collaborators and investors around the world to build a first version of the platform.</p><p>If you have any interest or recommendation, please reach&nbsp;out!</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>Emile Forest <br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>emile@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>Jonathan Lapalme <br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</p> Credits <p>Jonathan Lapalme — Co-Project Manager and strategist<br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>Emile Forest — Co-Project Manager and researcher<br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>emile@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>S.

<p><a href="https://cccv.to/">CCCV,</a> product of Blocko XYZ, is an incubated project by the AERGO foundation, that anchors member data on the AERGO public&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Blocko XYZ has announced that from June 11th, anyone who has their <a href="https://cccv.to/cccv.info">COVID-19 vaccination status</a> verified through the social DID service CCCV, will be able to receive a real badge and sticker that displays their status to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Starting July, the Korean government is waiving the outdoor mask mandate for those who are vaccinated. Once this policy is implemented, it will be difficult to discern who has been truly vaccinated. As the government has only issued confirmation stickers for people who have been vaccinated above the age of 65, there needs to be a method of distinguishing vaccinated people in younger age&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Although apps for digital vaccination verification have been developed and other similar services are being announced, there is continuing controversy over the issues of security and standardization, and all responsibility is being placed on the individual. Self-employed business owners who manage small scale businesses, such as health and fitness managers, pilates teachers and golf coaches, are particularly in urgent need of a way to distinguish unvaccinated clients who falsely claim to be vaccinated for the sake of remaining unmasked.</p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, Blocko XYZ has announced that it will award free stickers and badges to people who verify their vaccination status by signing up to social verification service&nbsp;CCCV.</p><p>Users can request a badge by clicking on the digital vaccination badge under the CCCV verification tab and uploading evidence of their vaccination status. The requested badge will be granted within 24 hours after the authenticity of the uploaded document has been confirmed by an administrator. After this badge has been granted, users will be able to request concrete vaccination confirmation stickers and badges by simply filling out the required information.</p><p>The digital verification badge can be selected as a top badge and shared with others in the form of a link. Users will be able to easily announce their vaccination status to their family, acquaintances and clients, and influencers may in this way encourage many others to also get vaccinated.</p><p>Kim Kyung-hoon, CEO of Blocko XYZ, announced, “We would like to actively offer our support in finding a solution to the various social problems that may arise following the loosening of the mask policy in July. As a social content business card service, CCCV is used by many self-employed people, from models and coaches to freelancers in various fields, for the sake of verifying their qualifications. We hurried to create the vaccination badge in response to the demand of users like this who required vaccination confirmation due to the frequent interaction with clients. However, consumers have complained that online proof is simply not convenient to apply to offline businesses. Since the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination APIs are not open, services are only being provided manually. So, we decided to produce a real badge that could be used offline.”</p><p>Blocko XYZ’s CCCV, which has introduced the vaccination confirmation badge, was launched in November 2020. It is a new online content business card service that combines a badge system for expressing one’s academic background, assets and various abilities, with a link sharing service. Since its launch, within just 6 months, CCCV has gained over 2 million subscribers and offers a variety of blockchain-based services including DID and&nbsp;NFT.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-incubated-project-cccv-creates-member-vaccine-verification-f7acc1893feb">AERGO incubated project CCCV creates member vaccine verification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The evaluation hits a specific Okta endpoint, passing the received token. Based on the response provided by Okta, Kong Gateway accepts or rejects the request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For production environments, the OIDC plugin provides caching capabilities for the Okta responses. However, for this tutorial, I’m going to disable caching to better view the flow.</p>

 Set Up the Okta Application 

<p>Regarding Okta’s settings, I’m going to use the same client credentials application I created before. With the client ID and client secret. However, my OIDC plugin has to be set with specific parameters to implement introspection.</p>

<p></p>

 Apply the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>In the Konnect ServiceHub, I have an IntrospectionRoute OIDC plugin enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The settings should be:</p>

 
   
    <p>Config.Auth Methods</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Issuer</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Introspect Jwt Tokens</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Introspection Endpoint with a specific endpoint provided by Okta to implement introspection</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

 Test the Introspection Flow With Insomnia 

<p>To better view the flow, I will use <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>, Kong’s API spec editor, to send requests to both Okta and Konnect. Below are my two requests.</p>

<p>The first one I’m sending to Okta, passing the expected parameters to get it authenticated and receive a token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the second one to consume the route, I’m using a specific Insomnia capability called Request Chaining. With this, I’ll be able to extract values from the response of a given request to build new ones. In my case, I’m pulling the access token from Okta’s response to make the other request and then send it to Konnect.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>Next, let’s send a request to Okta to get our token. There it is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This time, we can see that Kong’s request is ready to be sent since we got Okta’s token injected inside of it.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>And here’s the Konnect response:</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s important to note that Konnect is validating the token behind the scenes. Here’s one EC2 terminal where my data plane is running. Since I disabled introspection caching for the OIDC plugin, Konnect hits Okta for each request to validate the token.</p>

<p></p>

 Deactivate the Okta Application 

<p>Another way to see introspection is by deactivating the Okta application. All tokens related to it will be considered invalid and, as a consequence, will not be accepted by Kong again.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to Okta’s application and deactivate it. We should get a 401 error code from Kong.</p>

 1.Introduction <p>CRISPY the&nbsp;world!!</p><p>Here is CRISPY WHALES selected as the second company for the AERGO incubation fund program. We are making the online platform, Banana Clips. Thanks to AERGO’s&nbsp;support.</p><p>Banana Clips is a platform that provides users to buy and sell short clips. It allows users to convert trendy video clips into NFT, and protects their copyrights of video clips through the service with patent technologies. Users on Banana Clips can easily purchase a variety of short clips without any concern about copyrights, and can trade their video clips and NTF assets. Please look forward to Banana Clips, the new paradigm of the short clip platform.</p> 2.On going Banana&nbsp;Clips <p>CRISPY WHALES is accelerating its development with the support of AERGO to open the Banana Clips service in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Not long before this report was written, new members with more than 10 years of experience joined us one after another to build and share the future of Banana&nbsp;Clips.</p><p>Among them, designer Jiwon Huh, who is leading the brand and UI/UX of our service, is with over 10 years of experience in various companies as Chief Design Officer (CDO) and has tremendous potential.</p>Jiwon Huh<p>Jiwon Huh</p>  ex CDO of&nbsp;3billion  ex CDO of Casual&nbsp;Steps  ex Design Director of&nbsp;Klleon   2–1. Creative <p>CRISP WHALES is currently working hard to develop Banana Clips. In addition to the technical part, we are putting a lot of effort into developing designs that users can directly&nbsp;feel.</p><p>PANTONE LLC, a global company that leads colour trends in various industries, selected Ultimate Gray and Illuminating, a yellow scale, as its 2021 colours, which contain warm and positive messages for tired humanity suffering from COVID-19.</p><p>This is Banana Clips’s primary colour, which naturally has melted the 2021 trend into our service. However, unlike other companies that use a yellow colour, we applied Baby Green, which reminds us of unripe bananas, to further clarify Banana Clips’ identity, to express the process of short clips becoming a well-cooked banana.</p><p>Banana Yellow</p><p>This colour means pure and warm affection, sincere participation and&nbsp;‘ego’.</p><p>We chose Persona, who shares fun and funny things with friends and blends from morning to night and blends in&nbsp;harmony.</p><p>Baby Green</p><p>This colour represents young and cute likning the unique to fresh-looking baby&nbsp;bananas.</p><p>It contains the future of short clips that can be anything with colours that contains infinite possibilities.</p><p>Banana Clips’ colors according to basic behaviors</p> 2–2.Growth <p>CRISPY WHALES is making great efforts externally as well for Banana Clips will blow a new wave in the contents business.</p><p>We have signed an MOU for a cooperative relationship between Videocon (videocon.co.kr), which is a video contest platform provided by Slate Media, and Banana Clips. Starting with this, we are preparing cooperations with various content productions and distribution channels like MOU. In addition, we completed a survey of popular works in major NFT markets and short clips’ markets and found out what they want through the main target community of video producers and editors. Based on these data, we will fill the service with various trending videos until the&nbsp;launch.</p> 2–3. Tech <p>CRISPY WHALES is a technical partner of AERGO and is in the process of maintenance on some of the AERGO modules. There are many aspects that have not been reflected in the AERGO source repositories because technical reviews are still in progress, but new features that suit the trend will be provided one after another&nbsp;soon.</p><p>In addition, the technical reviews for the recently announced ARC2 has been completed, and actual use is planned for the service currently under development. This smart contract will be mainly used for video transactions through our service, but we are not forgetting to carry out various usability experiments, so we look forward to introducing other use cases&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Finally, all videos uploaded to our service will be uploaded to the AERGO network after various information is extracted by our internal system. Currently, we are developing a video extraction system and search platform, but a new smart contract for this will be announced and distributed in time for the service opening in&nbsp;July.</p> TODO <p>CRISPY WHALES is planning several marketing plans to acquire early users and various contents according to the Banana Clips launch plan to be introduced in July. In addition, we plan to take steps to launch a global service and a mobile app in business. With Banana Clips, you will always have access to videos featuring local cultures from around the world. In addition, we will actively utilize SNS channels mainly used by each generation to share information about video creating and editing and NFT, so that community participants can use the service naturally at the same time as Banana Clips is launched.</p><p>The development team of CRISPY WHALES is putting development plans for another smart contracts and layer 2 on the roadmap in addition to ARC2 to safely store NFT, trading information and copyrights data on the AERGO blockchain network. We hope to share with our community extremely thrilling news&nbsp;, such as a new business model to increase the use of AERGO tokens in trading, but we ask for your understanding that we are still cautious about revealing many&nbsp;things.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES is doing its best to meet the AERGO community as soon as possible. In the next month or so, Banana Clips will be coming to you. Thanks to everyone who waited, and we hope that you will continue to keep in watching with a little more interest.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/crispy-the-world-9c6cb4fde3e5">CRISPY the world!!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

But what happens when that collaboration moves from a gallery or theatre on to the blockchain?</p><p>The answer is, well, just about anything.</p><p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is pioneering a new kind of digital art crafted as a collection of live, editable “Layers”. Artists can maintain control of those Layers, sell ownership of individual Layers to collectors, or program the Layers to adapt programmatically based on anything from time of day to fluctuating stock market prices. What results is a fascinating realm of art that morphs and evolves, reacting to its community and the world at&nbsp;large.</p><p>I sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/breadbreaker22">Lisa Liang</a>, Co-founder of Async Art, to learn more about how <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> helps make it all possible.</p><a href="https://async.art/art/master/0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8-1494">Desert Clockwork</a>, Cyrus James Khan, 4-state autonomous NFT,&nbsp;2021 Appealing to a wider&nbsp;audience <p>When Async launched, new users were required to log in using a crypto wallet. This seemed reasonable for a platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, but user onboarding quickly became a bottleneck for the company’s growth. As Async began branching out beyond the crypto art community, it was clear that using crypto wallets like MetaMask was a serious challenge for many&nbsp;artists.</p><blockquote>“Before Magic, only a very small percentage of new artists actually ended up minting a&nbsp;piece.”</blockquote><p>According to Lisa, “A lot of traditional artists aren’t even on Twitter. The concept of using MetaMask or buying ETH — these are huge user onboarding hurdles. Magic makes it a lot&nbsp;easier.”</p><p>Like any NFT platform that relies on wallets, the Async team regularly spent hours walking new artists and potential buyers through the wallet setup process. This meant that the startup production team had less time to spend on developing important new features, and only a certain percentage of artists ultimately minted and listed artwork. Something had to&nbsp;change.</p> Onboarding built for&nbsp;everyone <p>To appeal to a wider audience, the Async team knew they needed an onboarding flow that didn’t rely solely on a wallet integration. On the flip side, they had an existing user base of NFT collectors who were passionate about crypto and decentralization. Magic provided Async with the intuitive user experience they needed while maintaining the security and integrity that are table stakes for a Web3 application.</p><blockquote>“Having Magic there eliminates 4 or 5 steps from our onboarding funnel.”</blockquote><p>Async’s top priority is enabling groundbreaking new forms of art, not necessarily exposing users to the tech stack that makes it possible. Lisa said it best: “Our vision for Async Art is to make this accessible for everyone. This is not just about NFTs, this is about utilizing digital technology to create artwork that could never have existed&nbsp;before.”</p><p>With Magic, new users simply enter their email address, click a magic link, and then dive right into the bold new world of programmable art. This streamlined onboarding flow translated to a smoother, faster creation process for artists. After implementing Magic links along with other additional features, Async more than doubled the amount of artworks created on their platform.</p> Focusing on fundamentals <p>Considering Async has invented an entirely new medium of art, newcomers already have quite a bit to wrap their heads around. Magic authentication means login is one less thing for new users to worry&nbsp;about.</p>Almost 40% of Async’s new users are now onboarded with&nbsp;Magic<p>The Async team has seen a growing number of new users opt for passwordless login since implementing Magic just a few months ago. As of May 2021, about 39% of all new users opt for magic link login instead of using a wallet. For Lisa and the rest of the team, this has been immediate validation that choosing Magic has had a positive impact on Async’s&nbsp;growth.</p><blockquote>“Magic makes everyone’s lives&nbsp;easier.”</blockquote><p>In addition to providing a smoother, more accessible onboarding experience for users, Magic has helped the Async team get back valuable time. Lisa told me login-related support requests are now practically nonexistent. That means the Async team can stop worrying about wallet creation and instead focus on trailblazing the future of digital art with new offerings like <a href="https://async.art/music">Async&nbsp;Music</a>.</p><p>Whatever comes next, I can honestly say I’m thrilled to see where the journey takes&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/async-art-is-bringing-nfts-to-life-with-a-little-help-from-magic-ef558e7c1184">Async Art is bringing NFTs to life with a little help from Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I am not a lawyer, but as an analyst and advisor, however, I almost inevitably encounter the implications of laws and current case law. Thus, this text describes only a personal assessment and is not intended to be, and should not be used as, legal advice (and in any case KuppingerCole Analysts do not provide legal advice). At the end of the day, any action should be clarified with colleagues properly qualified to do so, including the legal team.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_small" title="ruling of the European Court of Justice">ruling of the European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ), which has gained some notoriety under the name "Schrems II", has caused great uncertainty among many organizations. The fact that the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/ccpa-gdpr-as-a-catalyst-for-improving-data-protection-outside-the-eu" title="data protection standard, as currently practiced in the United States of America">data protection standard, as currently practiced in the United States of America</a>, is to be considered non-compliant with the requirements of the European Union and the General Data Protection Regulation has had a direct significant impact on an assessment of the processing of personal data abroad, especially of course in the USA. The mechanism previously known as "Privacy Shield" was rendered void overnight. This, of course, particularly impacts the use of cloud services, which had grown significantly over the past year and a half, not least due to the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/pepp-pt-bridging-the-gap-between-covid-19-pandemic-control-and-privacy-by-design" title="pandemic-induced migration to digital services">pandemic-induced migration to digital services</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_kerl_kinast" title="state of limbo">state of limbo</a> and lack of legal certainty required a comprehensive solution. This is now available in the form of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/1_en_act_part1_v5.pdf" title="final version">final version</a> of the "standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries" (published on June 4, 2021). This document, which was published by the European Commission, and the measures it describes are intended to make it possible to continue transferring personal data to countries outside of the EU and to process it there.</p>
 More than just paper – tangible supplementary measures are needed. 
<p>However, merely amending the contractual basis is not enough: tangible technical and organizational measures that ensure the minimization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization#New_Definition_for_Pseudonymization_Under_GDPR" title="pseudonymization">pseudonymization</a> (as defined by the GDPR) and encryption of transferred data must be developed, and implemented precisely as described. This not only puts the onus on the providers of such Internet services (and their supply chain, end-to-end) to support these measures, but also forces the users of cloud services, for example, to practice data hygiene and reduce the volume of data, which can only be beneficial in terms of improved data protection. The SCCs (Standard contractual clauses) will only be considered effective providing these measures are in place.</p>

<p>Considering this development as a layman in legal matters this document and the updated SCCs represent an important first step in my opinion. Even if the actual problem (the root cause) namely the possibility of American authorities viewing personal data on the systems of American providers, is not solved. Consideration must now be given to each individual case where personal data is transferred outside of the EU to select and fully implement the correct tools for encryption, pseudonymization and minimization of data at rest, in transit and during processing. While this will involve considerable effort, it is certainly more favorable when compared to the previous legal uncertainty.</p>
<p>This is where we as analysts and advisors come into play. Concepts, technologies, and products that can help implement appropriate technical and organizational measures are evolving quickly. Information Protection and Secure Information Sharing will become increasingly important. These include, for example, Azure Information Protection or advanced tools that enable the transparent encryption and use of critical information, including personal data. Sensitive data discovery, data cataloging and encryption concepts will play a significant role in light of this development. This holds true for structured data and unstructured data alike. Data governance will become a key area to exercise appropriate control over data of varying sensitivity. Data catalogs and data management will facilitate transparency regarding the nature, location and flow of data.</p>
<p>Finally, the requirement for organizational and technical measures to protect transferred data will also have a significant impact on the spread and use of more sophisticated, emerging technologies for encrypting data during use. For example, providers of technologies for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/homomorphic_encryption" title="homomorphic encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> can make a substantial contribution to the definition and implementation of appropriate measures.</p>

<p>Pikkle is the first blockchain-based voting and global viewer participation service application built on the AERGO platform. Without understanding blockchain technology, users can access voting as well as attendance results in real-time. Pikkle will be used by the <a href="http://www.kba.or.kr/">Korean Broadcasters Association </a>and developed by <a href="https://www.blocko.io/">Blocko</a>, AERGO’s technology partner.</p><p>What problems is Pikkle trying to resolve with the traditional voting&nbsp;system?</p><p>1. Cost inefficiency</p>  In general, the voting process is complicated and incurs substantial cost in voter targeting, identity verification, ballot count, opening process tables as well as checklists  <p>2. Trust in voting&nbsp;result</p>  There has been trust issues with the electoral system for a long time. Many people do not trust the result of votes — such as resident votes, broadcast program votes and legislative elections  There is a prevailing believe that views and poll results collected via social network services can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platform provider’s own&nbsp;interest  <p>Main Features:</p><p>Voting:</p><p>With the Korean Broadcasters Associations, Pikkle aims to provide a reliable voting service for all users. Pikkle collects users’ views and help their decision-making process through an app service rather than the traditional text voting or spam-type cold calls. ‘Pikkle’ will solve the existing voting problems by storing key data of the voting process (identification of voters, validation of voting, voting results etc.) using blockchain technology.</p><p>Many polls and surveys are still conducted by classic methods such as texting or phone calls despite the current rate of mobile phone penetration. Pikkle encourages users to simply scan a QR code to participate in festivals and voting actions. In this manner, we believe it can be a more convenient and fun&nbsp;service.</p><p>This method has been attempted by many big tech platforms. However, due to public interest and platform dependency issues, it was previously difficult to be socially accepted. Using blockchain technology, Pikkle aims to prevent platforms or stakeholders from interfering in decision-making processes and to promote two way communication by introducing a fair voting system in many content based industries.</p><p>Event Participation:</p><p>In addition to participating in various cultural and artistic events, festivals and broadcasting programs, you can use Pikkle in ‘Metaverse’ events. Pikkle diversifies the participation experience by issuing NFT digital tickets built on the blockchain.</p><p>Mobile tickets with blockchain NFTs (Non-Fungible Token) applied can be used to prove the ownership in the offline world. It even provides features such as joining a queue and tickets for concerts in the virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pikkle’s vision and&nbsp;roadmap:</p><p>2021</p>  Q2: Develop Pikkle Service ver&nbsp;1.0  Q3: Release Pikkle Service ver 1.0 and integrate the system with broadcasting companies and festivals  Q4: Develop Pikkle Service ver 2.0 — Payment&nbsp;system  <p>2022</p>  Q1: Develop Pikkle Service ver2.0 — issuing tickets on<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/ARC2NFT"> ARC2 NFT </a>(AERGO Non Fungible Token Contract)  Q2: Develop and release Pikkle service ver 2.0 — Integrate the system with Metaverse  <p>Origins of&nbsp;Pikkle</p><p>Pikkle originates from the words ‘Pick’ and ‘People’.</p><p>Pikkle’s logo was designed using a round shape feature to emphasize friendliness for every user. Purple is the primary color of Pikkle as the color reflects credibility and creativity.</p><p>Pikkle’s symbol was inspired by ‘P’ from the word ‘Pikkle’ and the shape of a cell phone camera lens that is used to scan QR&nbsp;codes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/pikkle-x-aergo-7d1b3421e1ff">Pikkle x AERGO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Zusammenarbeit und neue Arbeitsformen ermöglichen, IT-Modernisierung unterstützen 
<p>IAM (Identity und Access Management) ist ein Kernelement jeder Strategie im Bereich der Cybersicherheit. Kontext- und risikobasierte Zugriffssteuerung und adaptive Authentifizierung sind Kernelemente jeder funktionierenden Sicherheitsstrategie. Gerade für Zero Trust mit seinem Grundsatz „Nicht vertrauen – überprüfen!“ ist ein gutes, modernes IAM essentiell, um eben diese Überprüfung durchführen und Zugriffe in Abhängigkeit vom Risiko steuern zu können.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger wird in seinem Vortrag auf die Bedeutung von Zero Trust-Strategien ebenso wie für SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) eingehen, aber auch für die Möglichkeiten, IT insgesamt zu modernisieren. Dabei wird er aufzeigen, wie ein modernes IAM die heutigen Anforderungen unterstützen kann und dabei hilft, eine IT zu schaffen, in der Zusammenarbeitsmodelle mit Partnern und Kunden ebenso wie neue Arbeitsformen für Mitarbeiter flexibel und sicher unterstützt werden und die bereit für alle Varianten von Deployment-Modellen ist.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kuppinger-zero-trust-sase-iam"></a>

  <p> Viele Unternehmen nutzen heute mehrere Cloud-Dienste, wobei ihre Enduser regelmäßig Dutzende oder sogar Hunderte verschiedener SaaS-Anwendungen verwenden. Diese große Cloud-Migration hat erfolgreich eine Ausweitung des mobilen Arbeitens ermöglicht und beschleunigt Initiativen zur digitalen Transformation. Eine steigende Anzahl an Cloud-Diensten bedeutet allerdings ebenso einen Anstieg an IT-Sicherheitsherausforderungen. Neben den grundlegenden Cloud-Sicherheitsaspekten entsteht eine zusätzliche Komplexität sowie Interoperabilitätsprobleme, die sich aus siloartigen Identity Stores, nativen Toolsets und einem Konflikt aufgrund der geteilten Verantwortlichkeiten der Cloud-Anbieter ergeben. All das schafft eine erweiterte Angriffsfläche und muss von Unternehmen adressiert werden.</p>
<p>Die Identity Challenge ist die wichtigste Sicherheitsherausforderung die es für Unternehmen zu lösen gilt und wird primär durch die Standardisierung des Managements und der Sicherheitskontrollen im gesamten IT-Ökosystem bewältigt. Nehmen Sie an dieser Sitzung teil und erfahren Sie mehr über:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Die wichtigsten Cloud-Sicherheitsrisiken&nbsp; 
 Wo native Toolsets Lücken in der Sicherheit hinterlassen, die Sie adressieren müssen&nbsp; 
 Wie Sie mit Privileged Access Management (PAM) Best Practices für Cloud-Sicherheit implementieren, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit und das Ausmaß von Sicherheitsverletzungen in der Cloud deutlich zu verringern

 The Day the Veriscope Secretariat Responded to the Financial Action Task Force&nbsp;(FATF) <p>Veriscope and Shyft Network’s response to FATF Draft Guidance on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers</p><p>Last March, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued a<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html#:~:text=asset%20service%20providers-,Public%20consultation%20on%20FATF%20draft%20guidance%20on%20a%20risk%2Dbased,and%20virtual%20asset%20service%20providers&amp;text=In%20July%202020%2C%20the%20FATF,G20%20on%20so%2Dcalled%20stablecoins."> Public consultation</a> on FATF draft guidance on a risk-based approach to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers. Their high-level objective is simple: to update its<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/RBA-VA-VASPs.pdf"> Guidance on the risk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)</a>.</p><p>As long-time players in the crypto industry, the decision to participate in the consultation was an easy one. The Guidance is an extremely important piece of international policy for our industry; it sets the pace for all member states of FATF on how to treat and deal with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing issues when it comes to cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;VASPs.</p><blockquote>… we support the FATF’s overarching objectives of updating its pre-existing Guidance in a manner that maintains a level playing field for VASPs, minimizes opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and preserves the intended technological neutrality of the FATF Standards. However, in our view, further revisions are required to ensure that the updated guidance achieves these objectives without going beyond the requirements of the FATF Standards or introducing elements that will have undesirable or intended consequences.</blockquote> Intro <p>The consultation presents five different areas of focus for participants to comment. For the purposes of keeping this post simple, we will only summarize the responses.</p><p>In general terms, the Veriscope Secretariat sees several omissions or shortcomings in the proposed guidance. Should these remain in the updated guidance and become policy, the development, adoption and improvement of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as a nascent industry will be at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If you want to read the complete document, please click on the following link:<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/public-consultation#public-consultation-on-fatf-draft-guidance--a-risk-based-approach-to-virtual-assets-and-virtual-asset-service-providers"> Response by the VERISCOPE Secretariat &amp; Shyft&nbsp;Network</a>.</p> The Response  I. Definition of VASP and VASP activities subject to the FATF Standards <p>The revised Guidance expansive approach to the definition of VASP appears to be inconsistent and its scope could potentially lead regulators to consider, for example, key signers for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s), as VASPs, regardless of their ability, or lack thereof, to participate in the decision making process and custodial obligations.</p><blockquote>We see unintended consequences from this that could move to eliminate key signers from these processes which can further lead to security vulnerabilities at the smart contract level (putting innocent users of these systems at risk), and could introduce innovative obfuscation techniques that further eliminate governance methods that play important roles in transparency and functionality.</blockquote><p>Here’s an example of how this approach can create unnecessary complexity or, worse, roadblocks in the development of solutions for better financial inclusion: Key signing entities in community-run asset pools in DeFi protocols do not have the ability to verify the destination of fund transmissions, and, at times, these signing parties are involved in the blind transmission of assets through autonomous routes. We proposed a review of the definition of control and the role of key signers entirely in the process of transmission.</p><p>In addition, the expanded guidance touches on the role of developers, and the distinction between development companies in contrast to open source software developers (a very common occurrence in our space), is unclear to the point of being&nbsp;blurred.</p><blockquote>It should be noted that in the event this was to be true, even public protocols that are being designed today to solve FATF guidance and travel rule requirements would therefore be VASPs. This would lead to a massive slow down in current timelines and the ability for the industry to utilize smart contract native systems in enabling effective methods of risk mitigation for regulatory purposes.</blockquote><p>Our recommendation to the FATF is to redraft the areas that describe “developers” making a clear distinction between development companies and individuals paid on a fee basis. The blockchain space has grown, in many ways, thanks to open-source software and independent contractors; it’s imperative that we defend and promote this practice.</p> II. Mitigation of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks relating to peer-to-peer transactions <p>We think that the measures and controls in the draft guidance will not mitigate the ML/TF risks that might emerge when P2P transactions gain widespread acceptance. Most of the proposed measures will place additional obligations on VASPs and other obligated entities, resulting in minimal impact of mitigating the ML/TF risks of P2P transactions of unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>We support the recommendation that countries would consider ways of mitigating ML/TF P2P transaction risks through blockchain analytics. We encourage the FATF to further explore how blockchain analytics and other innovative technological solutions can provide greater visibility over P2P transactions between unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> III. Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>We believe that further clarity is needed around the FATF’s expectations of VASPs when transacting with unhosted wallets since the recent drafting suggests that the transactions should be treated as higher risk without providing a supporting rationale.</p><p>Based on our reliance on VASPs and their role as the verifying entities of the largest amount of KYC’s users in the space, we proposed that the FATF allow time for travel rule solutions to work directly on unhosted wallet discovery as well as VASP discovery before determining risk profiles and mitigation methods that may inaccurately assume the risk and hinder&nbsp;growth.</p> IV. FATF and Stablecoins <p>The revised FATF Guidance is generally helpful in confirming the applicability of VASP regulations to stablecoin issuers. However, when it comes to the specific details of comparing stablecoin issuers to other VASPs, particularly for the purpose of conducting an AML/CFT risk assessment, there are several aspects of the Guidance that appear to reflect a misunderstanding of how centrally administered stablecoins function. We believe that conducting an accurate risk assessment of stablecoins is contingent upon having a thorough understanding of how these products currently function, in practice.</p><p>Stablecoins have become an essential element in the crypto industry, with <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/90439/on-chain-stablecoin-volume-december">billions of $USD in volume being transacted through them</a>. The FATF’s understanding of the key features of stablecoins is somewhat limited to them being a volatility avoidance instrument. We expanded on this definition and discussed that their true nature is speed, reliability and low cost for cross-border transactions. Their usability is not limited to issues related to virtual assets, rather, to limitations of cross-border banking.</p><p>Our position, in general terms, is that the risks of stablecoins and their issuers are analogous to the risks of VAs and other VASPs and that prior guidance was already sufficient to mitigate these potential risks. New recommendations by the FATF necessitate an updated risk assessment of this&nbsp;sector.</p> V. Effective implementation of FATF Standards <p>One important element that we identified and discussed was the licensing or registration of VASPs in the applicable jurisdiction. We view this, and the suggestion that local authorities impose conditions on VASPs seeking a license to be able to be supervised as an unfair adaptation of prudential and market conduct requirements for traditional financial institutions unfit for purpose in an AML/CFT context for the VASP&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We believe that the only way to effectively enable compliance in this new realm is to allow for data-collecting centralized intermediaries, to be able to represent users and act as data custodians of that data, while allowing users to passport across decentralized applications.</p><p>Rather than imposing requirements, we recommended that the FATF follows a similar path as it did with money or value transfer services (MVTS), which, like VASPs, may have no physical presence in the country where a transaction is sent or received. In its risk-based approach guidance for MVTS, the FATF encourages competent authorities in the host and home jurisdictions to liaise as appropriate to ensure any ML/TF concerns are adequately addressed. We believe that this would be a more appropriate approach in the VASP context that would ensure a more level playing field among AML/CFT-obliged entities and would reinforce the FATF’s principles of information-sharing and cooperation amongst VASP supervisors.</p><p>We also commented on the risk assessment requirement the FATF seeks to implement. To this point, we asserted that the currently available framework is insufficient in helping the industry identify, assess and understand their ML/TF risks. The crypto industry is rapidly evolving and, unlike the traditional financial sector, hasn’t developed effective controls over decades of experience and operations. That said, industry stakeholders are already initiating a risk assessment exercise and welcome the FATF to an open dialogue.</p> Wrapping up <p>As it pertains to the approach to effective regulation, we believe that the FATF will likely need a fundamentally different approach to regulation.</p><p>When it comes to decentralized systems and smart contracts that do not, and cannot, centralize the data collection and compliance processes that traditional intermediaries hold, we need to look at new approaches to compliance and KYC verification. This is especially true for Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>Systems are being built today that allow us to decentralize or passport the identities and KYC data sets of users across smart contracts and noncustodial wallets. We believe that the only way to effectively enable compliance in this new realm is to allow for data-collecting centralized intermediaries, to be able to represent users and act as data custodians of that data, while allowing users to passport across decentralized applications. These systems can allow us to have source nexus points for user validation and onboarding, but still allow those users (represented by the public addresses they use today to move assets) to utilize smart contract applications while leveraging reliance on the source data stores and validating onboarding entities. This will be the future of how compliant opt-in systems work across this ecosystem and can solve many of the largest risks and threats that are inherent from an AML/CFT perspective.</p><blockquote>While this infrastructure is currently being developed in systems like Shyft Network among others, we believe that users should not be required to take on compliance or sanctions obligations directly. These systems, when they are solely in the non-custodial realm, are extensions of bearer instruments like cash, and effective regulation needs to focus its efforts on the on-ramps and off-ramps (like that of the traditional financial system) without requiring innocent civilians to take on compliance obligations and the responsibility of sanctions requirements.</blockquote><p>Decentralized systems should be looked at largely as public utilities and enhancements to the utilization of digital bearer instruments that are designed to invoke user freedom and the betterment of individual choice, while still ensuring law enforcement has the ability to effectively address illicit activity. Our ability to ensure these networks do not unintentionally transition to deeper levels of obfuscation is critical in this current time to ensure we can maintain visibility and transparency into how these networks publicly function. Regulations can help maintain this visibility in collaboration with this technology, or hinder it if we do not act collaboratively and cautiously to nurture its benefits.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The global digital&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;spend&nbsp;is&nbsp;set to hit nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://au.oberlo.com/blog/digital-marketing-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20digital%20ad%20spend,on%20by%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.">USD&nbsp;390&nbsp;billion&nbsp;in 2021</a>. But in&nbsp;yet&nbsp;another&nbsp;blow&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;big tech&nbsp;companies reaping the rewards,&nbsp;a bipartisan group of&nbsp;US senators has raised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/senators-raise-security-concerns-over-selling-personal-data-a-16351">national security concerns&nbsp;</a>over&nbsp;the&nbsp;automated process that makes personalized&nbsp;ads possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, their concerns relate to what’s known as&nbsp;“real time bidding”, the split-second automated&nbsp;auction&nbsp;process used to&nbsp;rapidly place&nbsp;personalized ads&nbsp;on&nbsp;web&nbsp;pages, and&nbsp;the “bid stream data”, comprising a users’ personal data, that&nbsp;is&nbsp;used in the bidding process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;three&nbsp;important&nbsp;things to understand here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  What the senators want to know&nbsp;and why&nbsp;  



  How real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp;  



  The privacy issues that potentially risk the safety of US citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p></p>



 What the senators want to know&nbsp;and why&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>On April 1, 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-bipartisan-senators-question-online-ad-exchanges-on-sharing-of-americans-data-with-foreign-companies">six&nbsp;US&nbsp;senators</a>&nbsp;sent a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/040121%20Wyden%20led%20Bidstream%20Letter%20to%20ATT.pdf">letter&nbsp;</a>to AT&amp;T, Index Exchange, Google, Magnite, OpenX, PubMatic, Twitter and Verizon&nbsp;demanding&nbsp;to&nbsp;know,&nbsp;by May 4, 2021,&nbsp;every “foreign-headquartered or foreign-majority owned company” to whom&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies&nbsp;had given&nbsp;the&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data&nbsp;of&nbsp;US users&nbsp;over the pastthree&nbsp;years. In addition, they want to know:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The specific data about users, their devices and the websites and apps they’re using that&nbsp;these companies are sharing&nbsp;with&nbsp;ad&nbsp;auction&nbsp;participants&nbsp;  Every&nbsp;foreign and domestic company that has received bid stream data in the past three years&nbsp;thatisn’t&nbsp;contractually&nbsp;prohibited&nbsp;from using&nbsp;that&nbsp;data&nbsp;in&nbsp;any&nbsp;way&nbsp;unrelated&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bid&nbsp;process&nbsp;  Any contractual restrictions in place prohibiting the sharing, sale, or secondary use of bid stream&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data and&nbsp;all&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;audit efforts&nbsp;and results.&nbsp;  



<p>The&nbsp;senators&nbsp;fear&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;easy access to&nbsp;bid stream data during&nbsp;the&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;process allows&nbsp;foreign governments to&nbsp;profile&nbsp;US citizens.&nbsp;To wrap your head around that risk, it’s important to understand&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;and the significant&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy issues&nbsp;that result.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 How&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/real-time-bidding/">Real time bidding</a>&nbsp;is an exchange&nbsp;that happens in the&nbsp;milliseconds&nbsp;before a web page loads.&nbsp;It&nbsp;automates&nbsp;the process of buying and selling ad space online&nbsp;and makes personalized ads possible.&nbsp;It’s often&nbsp;difficult for non-tech people to believe this&nbsp;data exchange and ad placement&nbsp;can&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;milliseconds of real time,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp;like an auction in that advertisers bid on&nbsp;available space on web pages and&nbsp;the space typically goes to&nbsp;the&nbsp;highest bidder.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/real-time-bidding/">four-part process</a>:&nbsp;</p>



  Once a user clicks on a link to open a web site, the site’s publisher sends the dimensions of its available ad space to what’s known as a supply side platform (SSP), a technology platform (like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/">WebFX</a>) that automates the process of web&nbsp;publishers&nbsp;selling their ad space to advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  The SSP then analyzes the user’s cookies to gather as much data as possible about the user. This is known as bid stream data&nbsp;and&nbsp;typically&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adpushup.com/blog/what-is-bidstream-%20data/#:~:text=All%20the%20data%20passed%20with,Information)%20is%20exc%20hanged%20using%20bidstream">includes</a>&nbsp;URL, device type, model, screen size, CPU,&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;and connection, web browsing activity and interests, IP address and ZIP code location, as well as age and gender.&nbsp;This data determines the most relevant ad for the user.&nbsp;  



  Next, a demand side platform (e.g. Google Ad Manager) uses the bid stream data&nbsp;from the SSP&nbsp;to assign a dollar value to the user’s impression (display of the ad on the user’s screen)&nbsp;and place&nbsp;bids from&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;on the ad space.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Finally, the SSP receives the bids and awards the ad space to the highest&nbsp;bidder.&nbsp;The web page then loads with the ad&nbsp;in the contested slot.&nbsp;The publisher has sold their ad&nbsp;for profit, the advertiser has&nbsp;got its&nbsp;product in front of its highly targeted audience,&nbsp;and the user is none the wiser&nbsp;that&nbsp;their&nbsp;profiledata was&nbsp;up for grabs&nbsp;only moments before.&nbsp;  



<p></p>



 5&nbsp;significant privacy issues&nbsp;of&nbsp;the process &nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>You guessed it: the process is fraught with significant&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy issues:&nbsp;</p>



  Hundreds of companies can participate in the real time bidding process. Every auction participant gets access to the bid stream data and they don’t even have to bid.&nbsp;  



  Most anyone can participate in the auction: barriers to entry are low.&nbsp;And while there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bidstream/">penalties</a>&nbsp;for misusing bid stream data, parsing the data is still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bidstream/">highly valuable</a>&nbsp;to participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Bid stream data&nbsp;can be harvested&nbsp;even&nbsp;without third party cookies&nbsp;so recent efforts by&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">Google</a>&nbsp;to ban third party cookies do nothing to&nbsp;mitigate the privacy risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  The bid stream data is usually&nbsp;anonymized&nbsp;but, as we’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/re-identification-of-anonymous-data-is-scarily-simple/">recently&nbsp;covered</a>,&nbsp;it’s relatively easy to match a user to their information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Data brokers readily package the bid stream data&nbsp;(particularly valuable location data)&nbsp;and&nbsp;sell it&nbsp;to other companies&nbsp;and&nbsp;even&nbsp;governments&nbsp;with little oversight — the key point of&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators’ concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Sen. Ron&nbsp;Wyden,&nbsp;D-Ore.,&nbsp;who&nbsp;led&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators&nbsp;in&nbsp;writing to the eight ad exchange firms,&nbsp;says: “Few Americans realize that some auction participants are siphoning off and&nbsp;storing&nbsp;‘bid stream data’&nbsp;to compile exhaustive dossiers about them. In turn,&nbsp;these dossiers are being openly sold to anyone with a credit card, including&nbsp;to hedge&nbsp;funds, political campaigns and even to governments.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concern of course is that the information ends up with foreign governments who could create digital profiles of US citizens.&nbsp;“This information would be a goldmine for foreign intelligence services&nbsp;that could&nbsp;exploit it to inform and supercharge hacking, blackmail and&nbsp;influence&nbsp;campaigns,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see which companies reply, what they say, and what happens next. It’s definitely yet another reason to put a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">US national privacy law</a>&nbsp;in place&nbsp;and to&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">proactively protect</a>&nbsp;your users’ personal data while we wait.&nbsp;</p>

			 The growing interest in security tokens 
<p>Capital markets are advancing into a digital-first world and financial institutions have never been so enthusiastic about investing in digital assets. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/security-tokens-growth-europe-cryptocurrencies?">According to a study</a> conducted by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Plutoneo, and Tangany, the European security token market is expected to grow approximately 81% annually over the next five years, and is projected to reach €918 billion by 2026. Its market volume could surpass the cryptocurrency industry in the next five years.</p>
 Identifying wallet owners is a regulatory obligation 
<p>Security tokens are becoming popular and are likely to become a major investment option in the future as the interest keeps growing. However, the change in market infrastructure does not change the fact that securities need to comply with financial regulations. In the tokenization world, investors hold their assets in blockchain wallet(s). Therefore, it is critical for issuers to be able to identify who the wallet owner is and whether this owner is eligible to own the security. Blockchain identities solve this legal problem for issuers. Digital identities not only allow issuers to address compliance issues, but also enable protection for investors through recovery processes.</p>
 Digital identities enable the recovery of security tokens 
<p>If a cryptocurrency holder loses their private key or wallet access credentials for their self-custody wallet, the assets (Bitcoin etc.) are lost and cannot be recovered as most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and controlled by algorithms. Unlike cryptocurrencies, security tokens are controlled by issuers who are liable to their investors by law. As each investor is identified on the blockchain by his/her self-sovereign digital identity instead of the wallet, issuers can recover security tokens to the investor’s new wallet after confirming his/her identity. The traceability of ownership is recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, issuers of tokenized securities using the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX open source protocol</a> are able to trigger a recovery function present by default in the suite of smart contracts. In practice, the security tokens can be recovered in just a few steps:</p>
 
 Declare the loss of the wallet: The investor creates a request to recover their tokens to the issuer (or its agent). 
 Verify the digital identity – <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>: The issuer (or its agent) verifies the token holder’s identity with a standardized KYC process to validate the provenance of the request. 
 Recover the same tokens in the new wallet: If the verification is positive, the issuer triggers the recovery function and the lost tokens are transferred to the new investor wallet. This new wallet will also be added to the ONCHAINID of the investor. 
 
<p>Therefore, issuers and securities custodians can fulfil their securities restitution obligations, whilst investors can participate in tokenized investment opportunities with greater confidence.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Custodial wallets vs self-custody wallets 
<p>As security tokens are recoverable, investors can choose to use custodial wallets or self-custody ones to store their security tokens with low risk. A self-custody wallet, such as Metamask, allows investors to self-custody their assets by managing the private keys themselves. However, in the case of private key loss, the issuer may charge a recovery operation fee.</p>
<p>While self-custody may seem like a good option, it can be difficult for the layperson due to the technical knowledge required.&nbsp; Some investors may want another regulated party to hold the asset custody accountable, such as institutions. A custodial wallet is a more suitable option for them because regulated entities like banks, issuers or marketplace operators will then keep their private keys. The cost of a custodial wallet will obviously be more expensive, and is sometimes based on assets under management (AuM).</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Regardless of the type of wallet, digital identities lie at the heart of security tokens custody for investors, and secure the assets against loss and theft. As such, wallets are less important to tokenized securities holders than to cryptocurrency holders. With security tokens, the digital identities of investors double up as their blockchain account, with one or several wallets, where assets are controlled and managed, while their wallets are more like blockchain browsers where assets are viewed and where they confirm actions. Digital identity paves the way for the new era of asset custody.</p>

   Distributed Identity ist vielen eher weniger bekannt und noch weniger in Verbindung mit der Pandemie. Die Konzepte, welche DI liefert, sind aber ein hervorragender Ausgangspunkt einen digitalen Impfpass zu erstellen. Warum DI generell eine gute Idee ist und wie darauf basierend ein digitaler Impfpass aussehen kann, wird in diesem Vortrag dargestellt.

Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals. Cardea <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/privacy-first-covid-verification-technology-takes-a-giant-step-forward-with-cardea-301286983.html">recently announced its first reference implementation in partnership with SITA for the island of&nbsp;Aruba</a>.</blockquote><p>As part of this ongoing initiative, the Linux Foundation today <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">announced the launch of the Global COVID Certificate Network</a> (GCCN) with Indicio as an initial supporter, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The goal of the GCCN is to “to facilitate the safe and free movement of individuals globally during the COVID pandemic.

It follows and operationalizes the Interoperability Blueprint (the “Blueprint”) of the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC), an industry coalition that has defined principles and standards for COVID certificates. LFPH has co-led the process drafting the Blueprint, which was released on Monday for a period of public&nbsp;review.</blockquote><p>So what does this all&nbsp;mean?</p><p>Between Cardea’s verifiable credentials platform and the GCCN registry to promote standardization and interoperability, we’re that much closer to having a portable identity that works (and facilitates travel) across borders — all while giving users ownership and control over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Learn more:   <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-connects-to-the-indicio-network-2ad5688d72fd">GlobaliD connects to the Indicio&nbsp;Network</a>  <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">Introducing the Global COVID Certificate Network</a>&nbsp;(GCCN)  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/privacy-first-covid-verification-technology-takes-a-giant-step-forward-with-cardea-301286983.html">Indicio Announcement of the Cardea Project contribution to Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health</a>  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-welcomes-new-projects-and-members-to-advance-public-health-safely-reopen-amid-covid-19-301298729.html">Linux Foundation Public Health announcement of the Cardea&nbsp;project</a>  <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea App webpage</a> with community meeting information (as well as links to meeting archives in Github, Slack,&nbsp;Twitter)  <a href="https://ledgerinsights.com/good-health-pass-publishes-blueprint-for-health-credential-interoperability/">Ledger Insights pre-announcement coverage of&nbsp;GCCN</a>  <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass</a> (and Blueprint)   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 Implementing the Good Health Pass’s recommendations with Cardea 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Cardea is a fully open-source and field-tested verifiable digital credential that meets the major requirements of the Good Health Pass.   
			   
				
				
				 <p>With the rollout of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (previously called the Digital Green<br>Certificate), digital health credentials for managing COVID-19 are now a reality. Political urgency has, unsurprisingly, driven the certificate’s development. A borderless political bloc needs a safe way to ensure travel within its member states. The question is how to make these certificates work—and evolve—in a way that maximizes privacy and security, while interoperating with other credential systems outside the EU.</p>
<p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) is leading two collaborative projects that aim to do this. The Global COVID Certificate Network, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">announced today</a>, is a way for COVID-19 test certificates issued in one country to be recognized as authoritative in another. The second is the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>, an industry coalition that has defined principles and standards for COVID-19 certificates themselves so that they are privacy-preserving, secure, and interoperable. The Good Health Pass “blueprint” is currently in public draft review.</p>
<p>Cardea, a full, open-source ecosystem for verifiable health credentials developed by Indicio and now a community-led project at LFPH, meets the major recommendations of the Good Health Pass and facilitates the goals of the Global COVID Certificate Network.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the alignment between Cardea and the Good Health Pass recommendations—and where development efforts will be focused to enable full compliance.</p>

				 <p>Cardea has been <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">successfully trialed</a> on the island of Aruba by SITA, the leading global provider of technology to the air transport industry. The pilot project enabled travelers to prove their Covid-test status to restaurants and hospitality locations around the island without having to share any personal information. Dangui Oduber, Aruba’s minister of tourism, public health and sport, <a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/aruba-tests-blockchain-enabled-covid-credential-app">described</a> the ability to trust important health information while preserving visitors’ privacy as “a revolutionary step forward.”</p>
<p>Cardea’s strength as a functioning, deployable ecosystem is that it is built using open source software and doesn’t require any proprietary technology for implementation. It is based on the Hyperledger Indy platform, and uses Hyperledger Aries agents and Hyperledger Ursa cryptography—each backed by dynamic developer communities.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cardea.app/">Cardea Community Group</a>, which meets weekly, is led by co-chairs, Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, and Keela Shatzkin of Shatzkin Systems. The Cardea Steering Committee, which will guide Cardea’s development&nbsp; is currently composed of Trevor Butterworth, Indicio; Kristy Gale, Honor DRM; John Kindervag, ON2IT; RJ Reiser, Liquid Avatar;&nbsp; Adrien Sanglier, SITA; Mitja Simcic, GlobaliD, and Mike Vesey, IdRamp. The Cardea Steering Committee is committed to inclusion in developing this project and will actively engage in recruiting a diversity of voices to join the committee.</p>

 “Identità Digitale, opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni” 



<p>Le Identità Digitali stanno creando un paradigma in cui servizi online e transazioni elettroniche possono sfruttare nuove forme di identificazione digitale per gestire in modo più rapido, efficace e remotizzato quei processi in cui il riconoscimento è obbligatorio. In questo evento cercheremo di dare una panoramica il più possibile completa su: opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni in fase di studio.</p>



<p>Marta Gaia Castellan farà un intervento che avrà come focus “Il rischio del furto di identità digitale e le attività antifrode degli Identity Provider SPID”.&nbsp;Luca Boldrin invece, affronterà il tema “Self Sovereign Identity: un nuovo modello di identità decentralizzata”.</p>



<p>Chairwoman dell’evento sarà Claudia Sandei, dottore di ricerca, avvocato e professore associato di Diritto Industriale e delle Nuove Tecnologie dell’Università di Padova, Fondatrice di Itll.it.</p>



<p>Grazie alla collaborazione del ClubTI di Milano e di Infocert avremo i seguenti relatori:</p>



  Alberto Zanini – Esperto Identità Digitale e Consulente Commissione Europea  Andrea Danielli – ClubTI Milano  Fabrizio Lupone – ClubTI Milano  Gianluca Marcellino – Vice Presidente ClubTI Milano  Sergio Stefanoni – CIO Bein  Marta Gaia Castellan – Business Compliance, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert  Luca Boldrin – Innovation Portfolio, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert  



<blockquote><p>Le conoscenze e le competenze di RAO (Registration Authority Office), Incaricati al Riconoscimento e di tutti i soggetti coinvolti nell’attività di Identity Provider SPID sono varie e complesse: diplomatica del documento di identità (tecniche di stampa, microscritte, rilievi tattili, timbri), controlli antifrode, utilizzo incrociato di banche dati ministeriali, elementi di social engineering. L’obiettivo fondamentale è proteggersi dal rischio di furto di identità durante la fase di rilascio, e in particolar modo dall’utilizzo di documenti di identità falsi, rubati, contraffatti, attraverso precisi processi di identity proofing e di vetting.</p>Marta Gaia Castellan – Business Compliance, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>In parallelo all’evoluzione del quadro normativo per un’identità digitale europea, negli ultimi anni sta acquisendo importanza un nuovo modello per la gestione dell’identità digitale, noto come Self Sovereign Identity” (SSI). La principale differenza rispetto ai più diffusi modelli di identificazione e autenticazione sta nel fatto che non richiede la presenza di trusted parties per l’autenticazione: in questo senso si usa spesso lo slogan “you are your own identity provider”. Anche se spesso viene associato a distributed ledger e a nuovi standard (formati, protocolli), SSI è in realtà un paradigma che può essere implementato su diverse tecnologie e in diversi flavour. Questa presentazione fornirà una panoramica del mondo SSI e di alcune importanti iniziative a livello globale ed europeo.</p>Luca Boldrin – Innovation Portfolio, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCer</blockquote>

A step towards portable identity for the&nbsp;EU EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Photo: Radikale&nbsp;Venstre<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">FT</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The EU is set to unveil detailed plans for a bloc-wide digital wallet on Wednesday following requests from member states to find a safe way for citizens to access public and private services&nbsp;online.</blockquote><blockquote>The digital wallet would securely store payment details and passwords and allow citizens from all 27 countries to log into local government websites or pay utility bills using a single recognised identity, said people with direct knowledge of the&nbsp;plans.</blockquote><blockquote>The EU-wide app, which can be accessed via fingerprint or retina scanning among other methods, will also serve as a vault where users can store official documents such as a driver’s licence. Using the wallet was not compulsory, those involved said, but citizens who chose to sign up would benefit from an extra-secure digital ecosystem and greater flexibility ideal for post-pandemic life.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1399839260971356165">here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>A step in the right direction towards a more portable form of identity — well, at least for Europeans.</blockquote><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-travel-73f90d18909c595da463994e16e17348">The AP on the portable&nbsp;aspects</a>:</p><blockquote>All EU residents would be entitled to an e-wallet, but they won’t be mandatory, according to the EU Commission.</blockquote><blockquote>But dominant online platforms would be required to accept the wallet, a provision that aligns with the commission’s goal of reining in big tech companies and their control of personal&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>Vestager said people would be able to use their EU digital wallets to access Google or Facebook instead of their “platform-specific” accounts.</blockquote><blockquote>“Because of that, you can decide how much data you want to share — only enough to identify yourself,” the commissioner said from Brussels during a virtual media briefing.</blockquote><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">EU set to unveil digital wallet fit for post-Covid life</a>  <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-travel-73f90d18909c595da463994e16e17348">EU plans digital ID wallet for bloc’s post-pandemic life</a>  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en?mc_cid=7b73084a87&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">EU Digital COVID Certificate</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/anej">/anej </a>— <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/01/apple-pay-competitors-could-include-a-european-union-digital-wallet/">Apple Pay competitors could include an EU digital wallet — 9to5Mac</a>   2.

This includes things like “faceprints and voiceprints,” the policy explained.

Tweet of the&nbsp;week <p>New York governor <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1399863589045952518">Andrew&nbsp;Cuomo</a>:</p> 4. A landmark Supreme Court decision over data&nbsp;access <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security">the EFF</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The Supreme Court rightly overturned the Eleventh Circuit, and held that exceeding authorized access under the CFAA does not encompass “violations of circumstance-based access restrictions on employers’ computers.” Rather, the statute’s prohibition is limited to someone who “accesses a computer with authorization but then obtains information located in particular areas of the computer — such as files, folders, or databases — that are off limits to him.” The Court adopted a “gates-up-or-down” approach: either you are entitled to access the information or you are not. If you need to break through a digital gate to get in, entry is a crime, but if you are allowed through an open gateway, it’s not a crime to be&nbsp;inside.</blockquote><blockquote>This means that private parties’ terms of service limitations on how you can use information, or for what purposes you can access it, are not criminally enforced by the CFAA. For example, if you can look at housing ads as a user, it is not a hacking crime to pull them for your bias-in-housing research project, even if the TOS forbids it. Van Buren is really good news for port scanning, for example: so long as the computer is open to the public, you don’t have to worry about the conditions for use to scan the&nbsp;port.</blockquote><p>And here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd:</p><blockquote>If one accesses a public website or a private website with user permission, it should NEVER be a felony crime to do so. While it is certainly possible to have penalties that publish misuse of public or private information, it is crazy to have a reading of a statute that can be used to penalize mere access to public data or a user’s delegated access to their own&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>Public access to public data is a public good. And private access to one’s own data is a right not a privilege. Neither Linkedin/Microsoft nor Microsoft should be able to intimidate startup developers for innovating around these principles on behalf of users. We look forward to building on our past victories in this realm with additional ammo from the Supreme Court that included support from elements in both the liberal and conservative branches.</blockquote><p>You can <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf">check out the Supreme Court decision here</a>&nbsp;(pdf).</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security">Van Buren is a Victory Against Overbroad Interpretations of the CFAA, and Protects Security Researchers</a>   5. On the topic of data rights and Big Tech bullying — New York to “revolutionize” antitrust <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/business/dealbook/amc-meme-stocks.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>The act’s passage would put New York at the “vanguard” of a national movement, 15 state and national labor and policy groups wrote in a letter to legislators that DealBook is first to report. The organizations argue that the law would “rein in many abusive tactics corporations use against other firms and workers that are difficult to challenge under current antitrust law and precedent.”</blockquote><blockquote>Market dominance would be presumed with 40 percent market share. Currently, companies qualify as dominant if they have 70 to 90 percent of a market. “It’s not illegal to be dominant,” said Pat Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project, one of the groups that signed the letter. “It’s just illegal to block others from the market unfairly.” In the act, an “abuse of dominance” standard would replace the current “consumer welfare” standard.</blockquote><blockquote>“Where New York goes, often the rest of the country follows,” Garofalo said, and lawmakers at the federal level could be motivated “if they see the ship is leaving&nbsp;port.”</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/new-york-state-to-revolutionize-antitrust">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>What would this bill do? It would change standards for how a firm is considered to be too powerful. While changing standards seems technical and wonky, such a change would in fact be a revolutionary act to break the power that dominant firms have over our economy. (I testified on behalf of the bill last year, and my organization has written an explainer of the legislation.)</blockquote><blockquote>Right now, to be considered subject to monopolization law, a firm has to have 70–90% of a market, plus it has to engage in egregious behavior that economists measure as inefficient. This bill would blow up that entire framework. First, a firm would only have to have 40% of a market to be considered dominant. Plus, firms that are powerful enough to set wages across an industry, ahem Amazon, would also be considered dominant. It wouldn’t be illegal to be dominant, but under this legislative framework, dominant firms would no longer be allowed to engage in predatory conduct or block competitors from the&nbsp;market.</blockquote><blockquote>The legislation would also expand what would be considered anti-competitive behavior. A bunch of stuff that is now dead-letter law, like predatory pricing or selling below cost to capture market share, could come back. The bill would also let private actors sue under these new standards, so it would allow newspapers, grocery stores, pharmacists, manufacturer and employees to sue if they are being abused by a powerful buyer, seller, and/or distributor.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, on the Federal side of things.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-f64b55d3-ae02-40c9-ad4c-07352527058d.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Divisions within party caucuses, particularly Republicans, are emerging as a new threat to Congressional action against alleged monopolistic behavior by tech giants, Axios’ Ashley Gold and Margaret Harding McGill&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s a blow to the longstanding theory that a bitterly divided Congress could still agree to tighten the antitrust screws on Big Tech, since both sides have beefs with the industry.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/d71eae">Briefing: Facebook Will Face UK and European Antitrust Probes Into Data&nbsp;Use</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/eu-uk-antitrust-investigations-facebook-classified-5ab1e7e6-b18f-4f3b-b6ca-e737ec828af6.html">EU, U.K. launch antitrust investigations into&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/new-york-state-to-revolutionize-antitrust">New York State to Revolutionize Antitrust</a>   6. At Bitcoin Miami 2021 — it was all about community <p>GlobaliD senior product manager <a href="https://twitter.com/pstav90/status/1401789767063269376">Paul Stavropoulos</a>:</p><blockquote>My biggest takeaway from Bitcoin2021 in Miami — we’re just scratching the surface on how tokens + NFTs will be used together to facilitate community.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mariashen/status/1401505500567638020?s=21">Maria Shen</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/markonovak">/markonovak</a>):</p><blockquote>I saw crypto being used in the coolest ways in Miami this week &amp; none of them had to do with payments.</blockquote><blockquote>All of them had to do with building strong communities.</blockquote><p>Maria should check out GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups!</p><p>And here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-community-bitcoin-miami">Michael Casey</a> on “money=community”:</p><blockquote>Our $DESK experience was a reminder that money has always been about community. There’s a feedback loop between people’s desire to own and use a currency and the way in which it intermediates human interaction. Regardless of how functionally advanced your currency is as a technology, this community function is a major determinant of its&nbsp;value.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Let’s face it, technologically, the dollar is outdated. The inefficient U.S. banking and payments system still uses paper checks, for crying out loud. It integrates none of the cutting-edge monetary policy and governance features that comes with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. Yet, it rules the world thanks largely to the self-reinforcing power of a “dollar community.”</blockquote><blockquote>Now, for the first time, that community is looking a little less united. As concerns rise about the political and economic sustainability of a dollar-centric global financial system, and as technologies spanning crypto, data services, trading and social media foster new approaches to payments and other financial services, people are exploring alternatives. It’s why everything around money suddenly seems unmoored, as a baffling array of new finance acronyms and memes leaves many in the mainstream confused: NFTs, SPACs, stonks,&nbsp;DeFi.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-community-bitcoin-miami">Michael Casey: Miami, Piranhas and the Power of Community — CoinDesk</a>   7.

 African Cities — Disrupting the Urban&nbsp;Future Harare, Zimbabwe<p>The future of humanity is urban. Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent in the world with an expected 1.2 billion urban residents by 2050.<a href="https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/af2"> The continent’s urbanisation comes with extraordinary transformative potential, but the structural hurdles are equally huge.</a> Historically, there is<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19Urban_West-t.html"> compelling evidence</a> to suggest that urbanisation and economic growth are mutually reinforcing. Yet in Africa, urbanisation is happening in a context of slow structural transformation, pervasive urban poverty and inequalities that compromise a hopeful urban&nbsp;future.</p><p>Building on last year’s Istanbul Innovation Days, the 2019 Harare Innovation Days on #NextGenCities will focus on the strategic risks and opportunities inherent in Africa’s rapid urbanisation. It will invite senior civil servants responsible for cities and bring them together with cutting-edge practitioners working on urban solutions from digitally-enabled distributed infrastructure provision to nature-based solutions, and from participatory city-making to sustainable food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Harare Innovation Days is twinned with an Asia-Pacific focussed Innovation Days in March 2020 event on #NextGenGov. Following both events we aim to open up new pathways for targeted support for collaborative experimentation and learning trajectories within governments starting in the Asia-Pacific, Africa and Arab States&nbsp;region.</p> #AfricaIsNow <p>The numbers may be familiar but are staggering nonetheless. According to the World Bank, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/01/21/urban-resilience-challenges-and-opportunities-for-african-cities">the continent’s urban population is projected to reach 1.2 billion by 2050. </a>Currently, the continent has three megacities: Cairo (10 million), Kinshasa (12 million) and Lagos (21 million). But this is just the start: if Nigeria’s population continues to grow and people move to cities at the current rate, Lagos could become the world’s largest metropolis, home to up to 85 or even <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247816663557">100 million</a> people by 2100 — more people than California or Britain today. And Lagos is not alone — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/urban-explosion-kinshasa-el-alto-growth-mexico-city-bangalore-lagos">according to some scenarios</a>, Kinshasa may have 83.5 million inhabitants at that point; Niamey, currently home to fewer than a million people, may have 46 million; and Kigali could grow from 1 to 5 million residents already by 2050. And it’s not just over the next 30 years, with all of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/africa-cities-organisational-structure-cairo-institutions">world’s 10 fastest growing cities are going to be in Africa over the next 16 years.</a> In this context, it’s crucial to remember that over 60% of the land projected to become urban by 2030 is <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/sites/default/files/Brochure%20for%20Urban%20Resilience%20flagship%20report.pdf">yet to be developed</a>.</p><p>The accelerated growth, not just of Africa’s megacities but also its medium sized growth hubs and even <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2019/04/how-bidibidi-uganda-refugee-camp-became-city/">previously rural areas</a>, poses extraordinary challenges for national governments and municipalities. But behind the evident everyday challenges of Africa’s rapid urbanisation — <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/knowledge/publications/african-economic-outlook">unemployment</a> and informality; the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/africa-regional-studies/publication/african-cities-opening-doors-to-the-world">infrastructure gap</a>; structurally underfunded municipalities; huge <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1229079/ghana-the-worlds-fastest-growing-economy-has-a-trash-problem/">waste problems</a>; widespread issues with <a href="https://landportal.org/book/dataset/afrb-surv">land</a> registry and corruption — we see a range of more long-term, interdependent strategic risks: whether <a href="https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/maplecroft-in-the-media/fast-growing-african-cities-at-extreme-risk-from-climate-change-analysts/">climate change</a> and the impact of <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-africas-invisible-silent-killer-1">air pollution</a> on the health of urban dwellers; <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/economic-growth-sub-saharan-africa-challenges-risks/">uncertain economic development</a> and rising inequality; the lack of l<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04685-1">ocally rooted evidence</a> and its impact on planning and governance; the unintended consequences of disruptive technology; food insecurity and the risks of <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511?platform=hootsuite">nutrient decline</a>; or the impact of rapid development on the natural ecosystems cities rely on. They all call into question the current pathways to greater prosperity and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>On the other hand, it also provides a massive opportunity. Frequently celebrated under the banner #AfricaIsNow, we are seeing incredible dynamism, creativity and innovation across the continent, spearheaded by industry, forward-looking governments and creative, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and enabled by new technologies and new platforms enabling cross-sectoral collaborations.</p> NextGenUNDP <p>By building on such disruptive and pioneering ways of working from across the continent, the Innovation Days seeks to unlock an urban future that addresses the current challenges and strategic risks of our time — a future that is uniquely African, rooted in the diverse identities of Africa’s peoples and places, and the continent’s ability to combine global innovations with local solutions. Through the Harare Innovation Days and ongoing support, UNDP aims to accelerate this African future by supporting next generation strategic experimentation.</p><p>The 2018 <a href="https://apolitical.co/solution_article/how-to-make-governance-fit-for-the-future-7-lessons-from-innovators/">Istanbul Innovation Days</a> on <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-d5dc78e53b1c">NextGenGov</a> already showed how disruptive technologies are shifting the ability of cities to serve their populations, from the blockchain-enabled real-time pollution monitoring system pioneered by<a href="https://www.commonsimpact.org/"> Commons Impact</a>, to<a href="http://metasub.org/"> MetaSUB’s</a> use of advanced microbiome data to enable predictive approaches like early warnings on looming epidemics or emerging signs of microbial antibiotic resistance. Equally, it recognised that new spaces are needed for citizens and communities to access and make sense of such digital opportunities — showcasing institutions like<a href="https://www.medialab-prado.es/"> Madrid’s Medialab Prado</a> that enable such engagement and which develop participative tools like <a href="https://consulproject.org/en/">Consul</a>, a software now being adapted and adopted across the world including in the rebuilding of Mogadishu.</p><p>Recognising African cities are a key entry point to address the interconnected issues of uncertain economic growth, climate breakdown, social disruption and governance shortfalls; in Harare, we will explore how a series of cutting edge innovations already being pioneered in Africa could further develop cities’ capacity for sustainable and resilient growth. In an uncertain urban future it is essential we co-build the institutional capacity to explore and lead towards opportunities that are genuinely relevant to Africa without trying to replicate western models and mistakes. To do this, UNDP is reaching out to senior level civil servants across some of Africa’s fast-changing cities — the key risk holders in the decades ahead. The aim of the Harare Innovation Days is to be a springboard to supporting them with hands on policy experiments in urban governance, development and infrastructure provision, with UNDP providing the required infrastructure to help these key decision-makers develop experiments that will help address their strategic risks. By convening them alongside some of Africa’s leading innovators and disruptors in the technology, urban planning and policy space, we aim to build a platform and peer to peer network for accelerated learning and implementation capacity for urban innovation.</p> Zones of Experiment <p>We propose four initial focal themes below. Of course they are not all-encompassing, but they are indicative of the complexities and possibilities of urban change in Africa. They go across a series of cross cutting themes — new pathways to creating <a href="https://www.ilo.org/africa/media-centre/pr/WCMS_444474/lang--en/index.htm">secure livelihoods</a> and meaningful jobs in an often informal and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/africa-future-of-work">changing economic context</a>; accelerating the shift to environmental sustainability and ecological regeneration; using the best of cutting edge technologies (AI, IoT and real-time satellite data) to provide us with <a href="https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/digital-earth-africa-satellite-dat/">new governance capabilities</a>; and securing pathways to inclusion across highly diverse populations. These are indispensable elements for the achievement of the&nbsp;SDGs.</p> Participatory city-making <p>The future of urban development in Africa cannot solely rely on state actors or large-scale corporate investment; to be resilient and legitimate, it needs to tap into the creativity, passion and drive of local communities and embedded entrepreneurs to co-create urban spaces and re-imagine how they are used. This is crucial in order to build on the unique identity of cities and the creativity of young people as a source of strength and dynamism — to engender new cultures of participation that cut across ‘online’ and ‘offline’, and in turn to enhance sense of belonging (especially in a case of unprecedented migration from rural areas). For example: the <a href="https://www.blockbyblock.org/">Block by Block</a> project uses Minecraft (a game) to give citizens an opportunity to design and re-create local public spaces; <a href="https://www.sei.org/projects-and-tools/projects/i-cmiist/">i-CMiiST</a> in Nairobi and Kampala are using creative methods to explore more sustainable mobility and RanLab’s <a href="https://www.ranlab.org/deliberative-polling-in-uganda-on-resilience-issues-in-the-mt-elgon-region">deliberative polling experiments</a> across Africa show that offline settings for participation can enable better implementation of difficult policy decisions like the relocation of communities due to flooding.</p><p>This is being supported by a range of diagnostic tools, from Arup’s City Resilience Framework to <a href="http://capacitybuildingunhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/workshops/2017-foundational-training-course-climate-compatible-sustainable-and-resilient-cities/Day%203_%20Urban%20Resilience/Module%204%20-%20Urban%20Resilience/Engagement%20Steps%20.pdf">UN-Habitat’s City City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP)</a>, and newfound collaborative energy. The latter converges around innovation hubs which put African talents and innovation at the forefront of a movement that will shape their urban future. These hubs from — <a href="https://ihub.co.ke/">iHub</a> in Nairobi to the<a href="https://cchubnigeria.com/"> Co-creation Hub</a> in Lusaka — serve as data-driven catalysts and tech incubators for young creative talents to experiment with unlikely ideas that address gaps in service delivery in their local communities and beyond. Equally, networks of young civic innovators like <a href="https://i4policy.org/">i4policy</a> foster a collaborative dialogue amongst policy makers, technologists and local communities, in order to create policy frameworks conducive to bottom-up innovation. Such networked movements show how people are already finding ways for their voices to be heard, shaping fertile ground for creative problem solving as well as the leapfrog innovation the continent needs.</p><p>How can we build on such dynamics to re-invent urban governance fit for the 21st century, rather than merely tweaking the structures we&nbsp;have?</p><p>Distributed, hybrid infrastructure (and service) delivery:</p><p>While many African cities struggle after decades of underinvestment, they also have the opportunity to learn from the past mistakes in creating centralised large scale public works. Huge increases in the demand for electricity mean there are now more than 100 million urban Africans<a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/living-under-the-grid-110-million-of-africas-unconnected-customers-represen#gs.l4g9ee"> who live right under a grid, but lack an electricity connection</a>, with massive impacts on productivity — but various alternatives are being tested to make systems more affordable, faster to deploy and less fragile both physically and organisationally.</p><p>In response to this, we are seeing a growing series of infrastructure experiments that utilize decentralized approaches, leading to more resilient urban infrastructures that help to stimulate local economic development. These dynamics can be found across mobility infrastructure — with <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2016/10/mobilized-construction-pilots-new-way-of-fixing-africas-roads/">Mobilized Construction</a> piloting a digitally enabled approach to sensing needs for road repair and creating micro-contracts that can be procured locally, often at a fraction of the cost — and housing — with <a href="https://www.ibuild.global/">ibuild</a> creating a digital ecosystem that provides the transparency and accountability for both governments to procure locally and people to incrementally build shelters/housing based on their socio-economic state — as well as sanitation and waste management with start-ups such as <a href="http://wecyclers.com/">Wecyclers</a> which work with low-income households using an incentive-based model to tackle Lagos’ widespread waste problems. This also provides much-needed opportunities for the <a href="https://www.energy-generation.org/about-us">creation of innovative enterprises</a>, e.g. in renewables, that strengthen local economies by generating income. Enabling many of these is the rise of technological innovations, from smart-contracts to digital cash — ranging from the well known large-scale success stories such as Ecocash to local initiatives such as<a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/about"> Grassroots economics</a>, which issue digital complementary currencies to foster local&nbsp;growth.</p><p>How can cities embrace such distributed approaches in their policies and strategies to build the infrastructures for the 21st Century at the scale, speed and inclusion necessary?</p><p>Food as a lense for circular economies</p><p>Cities have a unique opportunity — and need — to spark a transformation towards a circular economy for food, <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/cities-and-circular-economy-for-food">given that 80% of all food will be consumed in cities by 2050</a>. In many African cities, urban agriculture already plays an important role in poverty reduction, food security, flood protection and (as biogas) energy generation. However a combination of population growth, development pressures and cultural change is threatening this provision model. On top of production, the arrival of industrial food processing and distribution (such as supermarkets) has in many cases gone hand in hand with a rise in low-nutrient food types, replacing traditional foods with nutritionally inferior food; extractive economic models and the rise of open food systems that create externalities — leading to reductions in economic, social and environmental sustainability.</p><p>In response, several entrepreneurial experiments are combining new technologies with traditional products to recover wealth from waste products — such as<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45978942"> </a><a href="https://singularityusouthafricasummit.org/2019-summit-speaker/murendeni-mafumo/">Kusini Wate</a>r which uses Macadamia nut shells in mobile solar powered water treatment — as well as using the mobile revolution to develop more transparent, equitable value chains such as<a href="https://twiga.ke/"> Twiga foods</a> in Nigeria and <a href="https://freshinabox.co.zw/#/">Fresh in a box</a> in Zimbabwe. Taking this to city-wide systems change scale, Lusaka’s<a href="https://foodchangelab.org/food-change-labs-in-lusaka-province-zambia/"> Food Change Lab</a> is starting to work with local stakeholders to create a new urban policy approach to the food system and Antananarivo have set up a <a href="https://www.ruaf.org/antananarivo-food-policy-council-policy-practice">Food Policy&nbsp;Council</a>.</p><p>How can new technological capabilities harness the potential inherent in such locally-rooted pathways to better food, jobs, and&nbsp;health?</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>Urban growth is damaging vital ecosystems globally, with land use change a key issue alongside pollution, waste and carbon emissions. African cities are starting to recognise the importance of integrating climate change information into long term planning and design for critical (and green) water related infrastructure which also drive economic development and inclusion. As our built world is made up of complicated, open-loop systems that subsume and deplete the substrate of our complex environment — it is imperative that we create city systems that don’t depend on depletion and accumulation dynamics.</p><p>City-wide innovations focused on strategic infrastructure include multiple examples of innovative financing such as the<a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/africa/stories-in-africa/nairobi-water-fund/"> Upper Tana River Water Fund</a>, which uses payments from downstream water users to provide education and support for over 20,000 farmers in methods that increase yields while reducing the maintenance costs for Nairobi’s water infrastructure. Other innovations include disruptive technologies, such as the use of real-time sensors to create<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kala_fleming_easing_water_scarcity_by_understanding_when_and_where_it_flows"> Digital Aquifers</a> in Kenya; community based solutions such as <a href="http://ecolooafrica.com">EcoLoos</a> which provide a sustainable waterless sanitation solution while creating fertilisers, and <a href="https://massdesigngroup.org/">Mass Design</a> which uses exclusively local, responsibly sourced materials, with community members trained and employed throughout the construction process.</p><p>Given cities’ vulnerability to the effects of climate change, how can we build the strategies, regulations and investment pathways to ensure that nature-based solutions become the norm instead of the exception?</p> NextGen UNDP: An antifragile organization <p>These innovations hint at alternative futures, ones where innovation has been nurtured in our policy-making and regulatory capacities and our agile, multi-level governance models are more fit for purpose. In this context of high complexity and accelerated change, our ambition as UNDP is to transform into an antifragile organization, borrowing from Nassim Taleb, that adapts to change and converts strategic risk into strategic opportunity. We understand that the key to antifragility is the ability to fail in small doses and to use external stressors, like the significant strategic risks that cities face, to ‘gain from disorder’ over time and arrive at better outcomes. Our collective ability to deal with such risks and shocks, and to rapidly learn and re-configure our strategies, technology, people and interventions, (in short: our transformational capability) will enable our partner governments and their partners to show how #AfricaIsNow isn’t just true for the continent’s booming creative industries but also its unique urban&nbsp;future.</p>

 Blockchain Layer Enhancement 
<p>We have fully tested the integration with all of our solutions on Polygon, and our customers can now choose to deploy their security tokens on Polygon or Ethereum.</p>

		 
	 
                               <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This month we’ll take a look at our recent integration with&nbsp;<a href="https://polygon.technology/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GeROieC2104YV1g-15YG54LvxpTPUngYOeS9eIiuZaINXDRGm-SLLuYKrcN2JMUcEKn8p">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>Polygon (previously known as “Matic Network”) is growing rapidly, and has recently overtaken the likes of Stellar, Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Tezos in terms of its market capitalization. In the last months Polygon made some serious strides with some blue chip DeFi protocols migrating, including Aave, Curve finance, and 0x.</p>
<p>But what does our integration with Polygon mean for our security token customers?</p>
<p>Over the last 6 months, we have seen gas fees skyrocketing as a result of network congestion and ETH price increase with an all-time-high reached last month. Transaction processing times have also been varying a lot depending on the network load. The congestion and issues related to fees should get resolved through the gradual implementations of various deliveries of Ethereum 2.0 in the course of this year and next. However, for our customers and for ourselves having live activity on the network, these congestion issues have become a handicap over the last few months.</p>
<p>Foreseeing that this will continue to be a problem for our customers, we benchmarked several so-called Layer 2 solutions and sidechains as well as some separate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains and we selected Polygon as the best alternative solution for deploying our products (ONCHAINIDs, the T-REX protocol and the T-REX platform) on Ethereum Public for the time being.</p>
<p>We have fully tested the integration with all of our solutions on Polygon to make sure that the deployment of new security tokens or the migration of existing ones will be as seamless as possible for our customers and their investors. The first T-REX security token has already been deployed successfully on Polygon in May on behalf of one of our customers.</p>
<p>Our customers will benefit from Polygon being:</p>
<p>Secure&nbsp;– the network is secured by a proof of stake consensus and by the Ethereum network;</p>
<p>Performant&nbsp;– transactions are executed in seconds for fees that are usually under 1 cent, making transaction fees virtually irrelevant (we have seen a fees reduction by a factor of 1/10000 compared to what they have been over the last few months on Ethereum Public);</p>
<p>Easy to use&nbsp;– users can still use their Ethereum-based wallets, such as a Metamask or custodial wallets like the ones connected to ONCHAINID;</p>
<p>Additionally, the consensus mechanisms used on Polygon are far-less energy-consuming and as a result more environment-friendly. The Polygon team has an aggressive roadmap to implement interconnection with other blockchains and support interoperability. It has also proved over the last months that it is delivering the products planned as per its roadmap with the introduction of full stack scaling last week (26/05/2021).</p>
<p>Obviously, we remain fully compatible and supportive of the Ethereum Public network, and our customers will be offered the choice between deploying their security tokens on one or the other network. Existing customers will also be offered the possibility to migrate existing tokens from one to the other. Finally, this integration makes us confident that our products and services could be adapted to other EVM-compatible Layer 2 solutions, sidechains and blockchains going forward according to our customers needs.</p>

 Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow 
 
 
<p>Last week, the EU Commission published a draft for the so-called digital identity wallet “EUid”. According to it, within 12 months of the law coming into force, every EU state must provide its citizens with a digital wallet.</p>
<p>The draft for the “Digital Identity Wallet” states the following: Every citizen will be given access to a so-called digital wallet. They have to identify themselves once and the data will be stored for further use.</p>
<p>In addition to electronic signatures, documents such as birth and marriage certificates or driving licences are to be stored in the digital wallet in future. This goes hand in hand with numerous use cases – from digital administrative procedures such as address changes or tax returns to the use of health services. A possibility that would revolutionise our daily lives.</p>
<p>According to the draft, each country has three options for implementation: either it launches a solution for its citizens and businesses itself. Or it commissions a private company to develop the wallet and make it publicly available. The third option is a government-approved certification programme that allows private companies to certify applications for identification. The exact technical standards are currently still being discussed at EU level. Only after publication of these standards, the member states will be able to start implementing the respective solution. In doing so, they will have to pay attention to two aspects in particular: high security standards as well as a user experience that is as pleasant as possible. This is the only way to ensure that the solution is accepted by as many citizens as possible.</p>
<p>From our point of view, the introduction of the digital wallet is a necessary and right step to simplify the everyday life of citizens and to overcome digital identification borders within the EU. With the new regulation, it is possible to create an overarching infrastructure.</p>
<p>As one of the European market leaders in the field of digital identification, IDnow itself is working on its own technology for digital wallets. With the “IDnow Wallet”, users’ data is stored securely on the user’s smartphone in compliance with data protection laws. Fingerprint or facial recognition (Touch or Face ID) is used to release the data for identification. The user retains control over his or her own data at all times. Due to the zero-knowledge principle, it is not possible for IDnow as a provider to gain access to the user’s data. As a certified identification service by the Registration Authority according to §24 1 d) eIDAS and as one of the largest providers of eIDs, the online ID function, IDnow is ideally positioned to provide all citizens and companies with an identity within the framework of a digital identity wallet in the future.</p>

<p>The second edition of Tools for Thought Interchange took place on June 3rd – or June 4th if you were joining us from the other side of the international date line! And in fact, Iian Neill did just that from Australia, plus Frode Hegland calling from the other side of midnight in the UK, rounded out by Brian Rubinton in North America.</p> Fission: IPFS as global data commons <p>Boris kicked things off with why we at Fission care about the category of tools for thought, and offering the IPFS protocol as part of the answer to interchange: a global data commons. </p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/toolsforthought/2021-06-03%20Tools%20for%20Thought%20Part%202.pdf">Slide deck PDF »</a><p>For those that aren't familiar with it, <a href="https://docs.ipld.io/">InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)</a> is also worth digging into.</p><p>JeffG from Fission also briefly talked about an idea we're exploring: an open source browser extension to be used as a shared web clipper by any tool for thought, with content clipped and shared to IPFS for maximum re-use. If you're interested in #ProjectPachyderm, get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/midijeffg">JeffG @midijeffg</a>.</p><p>As always, <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by the Fission Discord chat to find out more »</a></p> Part 2 Presentations <p>Here are the presentations, notes, and video from Part 2. <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/tools-for-thought-interchange-part-1/">Part 1 is also available on the blog here.</a></p> Iian Neil, Codex Editor &amp; Standoff Editing <p><a href="https://twitter.com/codexeditor">Iian Neill</a> talked about Codex Editor and the concepts around it:</p><blockquote><p>"We need a file system for thought" <a href="https://twitter.com/codexeditor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codexeditor</a> <br><br>Multiple apps, semantic artifacts that can be shared across each other. Something "like" an operating OS, or at least the desktop OS metaphor for knowledge workers.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToolsForThought?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ToolsForThought</a> <a href="https://t.co/h3Q3hRUdmm">pic.twitter.com/h3Q3hRUdmm</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400628265975386112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>The follow up here with Iian and what he has built with Codex was meant as a compliment to Blaine's talk on atJSON: the concept of Standoff Editing, where annotations don't just exist as inline markup, but in fact are meant to be multi player – including with past / future versions of yourself.</p><p>"Liberate the user from the tyranny of embedded markup" was a particularly strong phrase!</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sHt8j3UwYqNOnRCBFLqZjNBxwkdAlmyKisrjKXjWRxI/edit?usp=sharing">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://github.com/argimenes/standoff-properties-editor">Standoff Properties Editor on Github</a>  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/codexeditor">Main page for Codex Editor on Patreon</a>  <p>As well as his on camera presentation, Iian also prepared an extended demo to YouTube:</p> Frode Hegland, Visual Meta <p><a href="https://twitter.com/liquidizer">Frode Hegland</a> took us all the way back to the <a href="https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/">original Tools for Thought: Howard Rheingold's book by that name</a>.</p><p><a href="http://visual-meta.info/">Visual Meta</a> is what Frode demo'd for us, "BibTeX and a little JSON": a way to put metadata directly into documents, that is both human readable and machine readable.</p><p>Frode made an amazing case for PDF as the 1000 year format:</p><blockquote><p>"I expect PDF to be around in 1000 years"<br><br>"I don't want my son to grow up with PDFs that are basically JPEGs"<br><br>Visual Meta is meant to add more info to PDFs. <a href="https://t.co/JO2DGEf5kl">pic.twitter.com/JO2DGEf5kl</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400640639390208017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>His sentiment about building for his son called back to our presentation with <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/overview-of-logseq-by-tienson-qin/">Tienson, creator of Logseq, who also mentioned building for his daughter</a>. </p><p>Frode invites everyone to join the Future of Text community, as well as to submit work for inclusion in the forthcoming second volume.</p>  <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeialfrkxg5ip7npzp6xyzqzif3zka64zk62ovtrj5w6eulhikmak6u/Hegland%20VM%20Presentation%20T4T.pdf">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://www.augmentedtext.info/">Augmented Text Company</a>, supporting Visual Meta in Author &amp; Reader, both apps available for macOS  <a href="https://future-of-text.circle.so/c/welcome">Future of Text Community on Circle »</a>  <a href="https://futuretextpublishing.com/future-of-text-2020-download/">Future of Text Volume I</a>   Brian Rubinton, Kanopi &amp; RDF for interchange <p>Brian Rubinton joined us to talk about and demo <a href="https://kanopi.io/">Kanopi</a>, his fully RDF-based note taking tool.</p><blockquote><p>Crowded market, BUT "Almost everyone is still using digital paper. There is still a very long way to go"<a href="https://twitter.com/brianru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brianru</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToolsForThoughts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ToolsForThoughts</a> <a href="https://t.co/wStIFLQXWf">pic.twitter.com/wStIFLQXWf</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400643189308989445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>This point about "digital paper" in the crowded market of note taking was in reference to limited "meaning" embedded in those notes (same as Frode's PDFs-as-JPEGs comment). Which perhaps was the theme that ended up emerging from all three presentations: more meaning.</p>  <a href="https://app.pitch.com/app/public/presentation/345a5721-0401-4c79-8009-f7a5fe2e07c8">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUF4aFGjwN2GnO2bkf3cUdTQIRgSCwAkU">Demo playlist on Youtube</a>   Video <p>Even though we had one less presentation, we still ended up going for almost 2 hours.</p><p>We had many wonderful attendees keeping the chat active, including a number of European night owls. The chat log is once again checked into the <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/blob/main/2021-06-03-chat.txt">TFTInterchange repo</a>.</p> TFTInterchange Community <p>This two part series was organized by Boris and the Fission team. Tools for Thought are a recurring theme in our <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/tag/presentation/">presentations</a>, and we'd love to keep supporting Interchange with our Zoom webinar account and our time at the very least!</p><p>We'd like to get a more diverse group of people involved, and make this more of a community project, that bridges community discussion, open source code, and interoperable formats.</p><p>There seemed to be general interest in at least a monthly community event, so perhaps along with timezone differences, we'll see if we can stagger them and so still have a presentation every 2 weeks or so.</p><p>Next steps:</p>  Please share your thoughts and notes from Part 1 and Part2: #ToolsForThought on Twitter, add a link in the comments on this post  Who wants to help organize ongoing talks? <a href="https://twitter.com/shuyunzhang99">@shuyunzhang99</a> has already <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/4">volunteered in this thread on Github</a>. She's in Australia, which naturally may give us an organizing lead for that time zone.  What open source code and interchange can we work on together? Boris has proposed <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/3">ePub to atJSON</a> in the Github repo as a project, please add your own ideas.   <p>Fission invites presenters most Thursdays on a broad set of tech topics. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Sign up to get notified of future events »</a></p>

   Vision 
 Buying a star can be a daunting prospect, even for those who have owned a planet for some time. A star is much more expensive than a planet, and it comes with new and confusing vocabulary. What's a naked star? Are some stars in lockup? Is mine in lockup? If it is in lockup, how does it get unlocked?

   Vision 
<p>Buying a star can be a daunting prospect, even for those who have owned a planet for some time. A star is much more expensive than a planet, and it comes with new and confusing vocabulary. What's a naked star? Are some stars in lockup? Is mine in lockup? If it is in lockup, how does it get unlocked?</p>
<p>If the prospective buyer is not using an established website such as OpenSea, and is instead buying from an individual, these problems become much worse. What makes a star commodity grade? How can the buyer verify the status of the star?</p>
<p>This documentation will function as a Guide for the Perplexed. It will tell the buyer what to look for, and how to look for it, in entirely non-technical language. More daunting tasks such as verifying the star status on Hoon and/or Ethereum will be described clearly and plainly. By following this guide, the buyer will be able to verify the star's status, not merely trust the seller.</p>
 Design 
<p>The documentation will be entirely text. Since I know few of the answers to these questions, I will post in The Marketplace and other channels on Urbit to seek community input. I will gather knowledge from anyone willing to share, and compile an easy-to-read and well-sourced document that can be posted and shared anywhere useful.</p>
 Me 
<p>I'm a full-stack software engineer and former lawyer. I'm adept at navigating new domains and sharing what I've learned in an accessible and pleasant way.</p>
 Milestones 
 Documentation is merged 
<p>1 stars
1-2 months, probably toward the end of July 2021</p>

<p>This is the second of two blogs on our new White Paper: <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transform At Scale</a>. The <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/our-new-white-paper-achieving-transformation-at-scale-f97320f8447e">first blog</a> focused on the infrastructure challenge. This blog focuses on the parallel need for institutional innovation.</p><p>Sometimes, when a society confronts a new challenge, the institutions it previously relied on to provide solutions cannot cope. New, different institutions are needed. We think this is the case with personal data. Traditionally, our society has looked to two main types of institution to unleash social and economic opportunities: private sector firms focused on maximising their profits and state-owned enterprises. But as this blog explains, these types of institution cannot rise to the particular challenges posed by personal data. A different type of institution is needed, and thankfully we have one to hand: the Community Interest Company&nbsp;(CIC).</p><p>Many people are still not familiar with CICs, which often come across as a rather strange hybrid beast. CICs&nbsp;are:</p>  asset locked. This means any assets a CIC develops cannot be sold to another entity that is not also asset locked and equally committed to pursuing its community purpose. Mydex is not seeking a trade sale or ‘exit’: it is committed to continuing the operation and extension of its platform as permanent infrastructure to benefit its community (citizens).  dividend capped. Only 35% of distributable profits can be returned to shareholders. The remaining 65% must be reinvested in furthering the community benefits for which the CIC was established.  <p>Why has Mydex chosen this unfamiliar CIC&nbsp;status?</p> Mission logic <p>One simple explanation is that when Mydex was established back in 2007, its founders didn’t just want to sell a product in order to make money. They wanted to produce a service that brings benefits to people and communities and recognised they needed to make money in order to fund this service provision. Making money isn’t the purpose of the business. Benefiting the community by achieving its mission is the purpose, and making money is a means to achieving that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>A second reason is that we recognised that personal data throws up huge issues and challenges relating to trust. We reasoned as follows: If there is a lack of trust surrounding the collection and use of personal data, its full personal, social and economic potential will be hampered by mutual suspicion, power struggles and conflict and therefore never realised. A new type of institution that builds trustworthiness into what it does, and how, is needed for this challenge.</p><p>How CIC status helps us rise to this challenge is not immediately obvious but the logic is powerful. It’s worth exploring.</p> Economic logic <p>The unique and particular challenges (and opportunities) of personal data lie in the fact that unlike physical products and most services, data is a resource that can be used by many different people and organisations for many different purposes without ever getting ‘used up’. Because of this, it breaks the boundaries imposed by current notions of ‘private property’. Institutions organised around the notion of ownership of private property and profit maximisation are struggling to come to terms with a new world where value is created by data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This takes us to the first unique challenge for Mydex: the question “What makes an enterprise economically viable and successful?”</p><p>It’s commonly assumed that the acid test of an enterprise’s economic success is how much money it makes. But that relates to its financial success, not its economic&nbsp;success.</p><p>If you stop to think about it, organisations’ economic results always lie outside their traditional legal and accounting boundaries — in the value their products or services generate in being used by other parties (while how much money they make is an internal measure). So, for example, the economic (and social) value of electricity isn’t measured by the money electricity suppliers happen to make. It lies in all the many uses our society uses electricity for.</p><p>This is true of all enterprises. The job of a car or phone maker is to provide people with cars or phones — that provide them with mobility and help them communicate: things they want to do in their lives. The job of a hospital is to treat the sick; the job of an orchestra to delight audiences with its music; the job of a local shop to make accessing the necessaries of life&nbsp;easy.</p><p>For most enterprises, this external economic impact is implicit. It’s not something they worry about too much, because they are focused on the internal measures that matter to them. But in the case of Mydex it needs to be made explicit, because the whole purpose of the organisation is the external value it helps to create: making data available to people (especially citizens) outside its traditional organisational boundaries, so that they can use this data for their own purposes. Adopting CIC status makes this external purpose explicit and focuses attention (of people both inside and outside the organisation) on this external&nbsp;purpose.</p> Financial logic <p>If it’s true that financial success is not the same as economic success, then how much money an organisation happens to make has got nothing to do with its external economic impact. If it’s a charity or public service, it could deliver huge economic benefits but not ‘make’ any money at all. If it’s a mafia syndicate, it could make huge amounts of money while its external economic impacts are 100% negative.</p><p>But to survive, an organisation needs to cover its costs, and how it does so&nbsp;matters.</p><p>If it’s a charity, it needs income from donations. If it’s a public service, it needs to be paid for by taxes. If it sells products or services, it needs customers willing to pay for them. If it needs external investment, it needs investors willing to&nbsp;invest.</p><p>Each of these approaches to funding has its advantages and disadvantages. At Mydex, we chose not to be a charity for two reasons. First, because with a focus like ours on personal data we feared that we would end up spending so much time and effort seeking benefactors and donations that this quest could end up diverting our attention away from actually delivering our mission. Second, this constant need to attract benefactors might place us under pressure to bend our mission to these benefactors’ whims.</p><p>Likewise, we don’t think an organisation with a mission like ours, relating to personal data, should rely directly on taxpayer funding for two reasons. First, there are immense risk and trust issues involved in the state having comprehensive citizen databases under its control. Second, taxpayer funded services often find themselves at the mercy of shifting political winds. That is why we chose to be a company that can cover its costs from what it sells: so that it isn’t dependent on external funders and remains free to make its own decisions. For us, this strategic independence is extremely important.</p><p>But does this mean we simply have to bend to the will of a different set of external parties, namely customers (e.g. the organisations who pay Mydex fees to connect to its platform) and investors?</p><p>It could, in theory. But we have designed our business model carefully to avoid this risk. We have designed our revenue streams so that we are financially incentivised to be a neutral enabler, not a ‘data monetiser’: we only sell connections to our platform to enable safe, easy, low cost data sharing; we don’t sell or rent any data itself. And the dividend cap for shareholders means the community always benefits from the lions’ share of any profits we happen to&nbsp;make.</p><p>Getting this balance right is crucial because of the extraordinary potential of the Mydex business model: the more it grows the more profitable it gets. Exponentially. As a platform business, Mydex’s core operating costs do not rise rapidly with volume use. But the more organisations that connect to this platform, the more revenues the platform generates. In other words, as Mydex grows its revenue streams grow much faster than its costs — which means that Mydex has the potential to become extremely profitable. By creating a legally-enforceable dividend cap that requires it to reinvest two thirds of any profits it makes in its community mission, CIC status ensures that Mydex’s external, economically beneficial community purpose always remains paramount.</p><p>(This has an important knock-on internal cultural impact. It means that in everything we do and how we do, we focus all our efforts on doing those things that will continually improve the external value we generate — our community contribution — on ‘making’ rather than ‘taking’. It creates a discipline and a yardstick for decision-making.)</p> Strategic logic <p>But this external value focus creates a potential problem. Why should investors bother investing in a company that only returns a third of the profits it makes to them when they could in theory get all the&nbsp;profits?</p><p>The simple answer to this question is that a third of a very large sum is much bigger than all of a tiny&nbsp;sum.</p><p>There is a paradox to this answer which goes to the heart of Mydex’s CIC status. It relates to the two separate elements: the ‘very large sum’ and the ‘tiny&nbsp;sum’.</p><p>Let’s start with the very large sum. With its data sharing infrastructure Mydex is creating the equivalent of a mass production assembly line for the entire data economy. Henry Ford’s assembly lines reduced the costs of making motor cars by over 90%. They made a transformational product affordable to ordinary people, unleashed a tidal wave of product innovation and transformed the way societies and economies worked. Mydex is doing the same with personal data: slashing the costs of accessing and using it, making its benefits available to ordinary people, unleashing innovation and transforming the way our society and economy uses our data in the process. The potential scale of this business is enormous and global. It could generate very large sums of&nbsp;money.</p><p>What about the tiny sum? A year or two ago, the UK Treasury published a paper on the Economic Value of Data. It contained a crucial insight. It noted that “innovative uses of data can generate powerful positive externalities (i.e. benefits) that may not always accrue to the data creator or controller. This can result in data being under-exploited or under-shared.”</p><p>In other words, the Treasury was accepting that private companies focused only on profit maximisation have no reason to pursue the transformational external economic benefits we have been talking about: they have no reason to build the data sharing infrastructure that Mydex is building.</p><p>This means that without a new type of institution that prioritises the external benefits identified by Treasury they won’t ever happen. If we stick with existing institutions with their existing priorities, the very large sum becomes a tiny sum. Forever. Investors who insist on having access to all the profits will get close to none instead. The opportunity will be stillborn.</p><p>This goes deep into Mydex’s role. The UK Treasury was highlighting a strategic collective action problem. It would greatly benefit all parties if investment was made into the infrastructure that makes the safe, efficient, privacy protecting sharing of personal data possible, so that all its uses and potential can be realised. But it’s not in the immediate interests (or role) of any current data controllers (e.g. organisations collecting and using personal data) to take on the cost, risk or responsibility of making this investment.</p><p>Somebody else needs to take on this role. But this somebody has to be different. They cannot be focused on grabbing all the benefits for themselves. They have to be focused on creating external community value. And these priorities need to be baked into how they work. That’s what CIC status does: bake these purposes into the organisation’s legal structure. As a CIC Mydex is legally required to share financial rewards equitably. And, as a CIC, we are legally required to keep to the above promises in perpetuity (unlike venture capitalist funded outfits that are incentivised to make all the promises in the world and to break these promises once they have achieved a profitable ‘exit’).</p><p>To put it simply, to break the Treasury’s collective action problem and to fully unleash personal data’s ‘positive powerful externalities’ we need a new type of institution that every stakeholder can trust. Only a new, neutral, independent, non-threatening, non-competing, trustworthy body can break the collective action logjam and Mydex’s CIC status formally confirms and signals to everyone concerned that this is its positive, permanent, enabling&nbsp;role.</p> The final piece of&nbsp;jigsaw <p>There is one more piece of this jigsaw that finally locks all the others into place. There are two main types of Community Interest Company: companies limited by guarantee and companies limited by&nbsp;shares.</p><p>Companies limited by guarantee are not-for-profit enterprises, while companies limited by shares can make a profit and distribute (some) dividends to shareholders. Mydex has chosen to be a company limited by shares.&nbsp;Why?</p><p>To some purists, CICs limited by shares are not ‘real’ community interest companies. The purists’ assumption is that if any shareholder stands to make any money out of investing in the company, then by definition they are extracting value from it and therefore exploiting the community that the company is supposed to be&nbsp;serving.</p><p>We don’t see it that way. Mydex is building nationwide infrastructure that will last for decades and building such infrastructure takes time (decades) and money. Which means it needs investment.</p><p>Most financial investors today adopt the role of cherry pickers. They search around for ripe fruit ready for the picking and invest in the cherry picking operation: big, quick, low-risk returns. Mydex is doing the opposite. We are planting and tending a cherry orchard from seedling to maturity — without which there will be no cherries to pick (the ‘positive externalities’ the Treasury was talking about). But this requires a different type of investor: one who ‘gets’ the mission and is prepared to be patient (because reaching the point where those increasing returns kick in will take many&nbsp;years).</p><p>Paying dividends (limited to one third of any profits made) to such investors is not exploitation of the community. It is paying for a service that makes a community benefit possible, just as paying staff to develop the software is not staff exploiting the community but making the community benefit possible. Once again, CIC status helps us to turn potential conflict into alignment to achieve a positive way&nbsp;forward.</p> Locust or&nbsp;bee? <p>Mydex’s mission — to empower every individual with their own data — is potentially global, long term and paradigm-changing: if successful it would put the modern data economy on a new and different footing.</p><p>In nature, we find many strategies for survival. There are predators and prey, parasites and hosts, foragers, scavengers, hunters. Locusts flourish by devouring the value other organisms have produced. Bees flourish by helping plants flourish — to flower and&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>Today’s personal data economy is dominated by locusts, intent on extracting as much profit as they can from individuals’ data. In choosing to be a Community Interest Company, Mydex brings together economic, financial and strategic logic to make it possible for the company to flourish as a bee, and therefore for the orchards to flourish and fruit too. We flourish by helping others to flourish. That, we believe, is why in the long term we will be successful. And that is why we are a Community Interest&nbsp;Company.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/can-i-trust-you-6771a6ca0e35">Can I trust you?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Session Management is a pretty scary term for a lot of developers.  Most of the mechanics of session management are abstracted away from developers, to the point where they don’t properly learn about it until it’s necessary.  Usually, this means a late night trying to figure out a vulnerability, a bug, or how to work with a new session management library.  Hopefully, I can remove some of the magic behind session management in NodeJs and give you a good fundamental place to start.  In this article, you will learn what sessions are, how to manage them in Node.js, and some details that should help you minimize bugs and vulnerabilities.</p>

 Overview of Sessions 

<p>I will start at the beginning.  When a user uses your web application, they make an HTTP request to the webserver.  The server then knows what to do with this request and returns a response.  The user’s request must contain all the necessary information for the server to make a decision.  For example, is the user authenticated?  Is he/she authorized to view a specific page?  Does the user have a shopping cart that needs to be displayed?  All this information that makes the user experience feel seamless, as though he/she is  using one continuous application, must be transmitted from the client to the server.  If the application were to transmit all this data back and forth on each request, you would introduce massive security and performance concerns.  There are many ways to streamline this effort, but for the sake of this article, I will focus on cookie-based sessions.</p>

<p>When a user sends a request to your web application, they will add a session cookie to the request headers.  If this is the first time a user has requested your site, the server will create a new session cookie and return it to the client.  The session is given an ID that both the client and server can reference.  This enables the application to split the session data between that which is stored on the client-side and that which is stored on the server.  For example, the cookie may tell the application the session ID and that the user is authenticated.  The server can use this information to access the user’s shopping cart in the server’s store.</p>

<p>Of course, any time an application sends information to the client it could possibly end up in an enemy’s hands.  The majority of your users aren’t necessarily bad actors, but bad actors are certainly looking for ways to exploit your application.  Most security concerns should be addressed by you, the developer and maintainer of the application and the developer of whatever session management library you’re using.</p>

 Session Management Risks 

<p>As an aside, I should note that it’s generally better to use a well-established session management library than to roll your own.  You will see a few examples of that later in this article.  For now, let’s take a look at some common session security concerns.</p>

 Session Prediction 

<p>Each session has an associated session ID with it.  It is very important that this session ID is properly randomized, such that an attacker cannot simply guess a few options and bypass any security associated with the session ID.  Suppose your session IDs were sequential integers.  An attacker could log in, create a new session, and see their session ID is <code>12345</code>.  The attacker could then try to pass the session ID <code>12344</code> or <code>12343</code> to the server in an attempt to hijack a session from another user.</p>

 Session Sniffing 

<p>In session sniffing, an attacker can use a sniffing application such as Wireshark or a proxy to capture network traffic between a client and server.  As you’ve learned, that traffic will ultimately contain a request with a session cookie in it.  This cookie will have the session ID which can then be hijacked.</p>

 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks 

<p>In a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker sits between the web server and the client.  The attacker can then pass requests from the client to the server and respond without detection from either.  But along the way, the attacker has gained access to the session.</p>

 Client Side Attacks 

<p>There are many strategies for attacking the client.  Some of the best known are Cross-Site Scripting, Trojans, and malicious javascript codes.  Sometimes it just takes some good old-fashioned social engineering to obtain session information from a client.  The idea here is that the attack will attempt to exploit the client itself to get access from the cookie in the browser’s storage.  For example, an attacker that can inject malicious Javascript code could inject the following javascript:</p>

   <code>alert(document.cookie);
</code>   

<p>With that simple line of code, the attack can now gain access to the cookie along with all the session goodies in it.</p>

 Good Session Management Practices 

<p>All of this is probably a little scary,  But many people are working on the other side to help prevent these attacks or minimize their impacts.  Most of these strategies are rolled into session management libraries, and any library that is continuously maintained should be up to date with the latest security enhancements.  But, it’s important for you, as a developer who takes security seriously, to understand what security should be in place.</p>

 Session Secret 

<p>Any good session management library should come with an option to change the <code>session secret</code>.  It may have slightly different names but the idea is always the same.  The secret is used to compute a hash against the session ID.  This helps to prevent session hijacking by ensuring the session cookie hasn’t been tampered with.</p>

 Session Expiration 

<p>Another good practice is to expire the session after some predetermined time.  There are two ways to expire a session: (1) based on inactivity or (2) absolutely.  When you base your expiration on inactivity, it will keep the session open until the user hasn’t made a request for some amount of time.  When you choose to expire it absolutely, then the session will expire after some predetermined time, regardless of activity.  The session will then need to be refreshed.  You should at least set an inactivity session expiration so you don’t have stale and vulnerable sessions available for attack.</p>

 Cookie Expiration 

<p>Similar to session expiration, you can also expire the cookie that was sent to the browser.  Many times, cookies are set to expire when the session expires.  However, it is possible to allow the cookie to remain available indefinitely.  This is a poor decision for the same reason as session expiration.  Generally, session expiration is a strong tool for minimizing the impacts of attack, but implementing cookie expiration is also helpful.</p>

 Regeneration of Session After Login 

<p>When a user first accesses your site, he/she can use an anonymous session.  This is a fairly common practice where you want to track a user’s movements in your application but don’t want to require them to log in.  For example, consider a shopping site where an anonymous user can have a shopping cart but can’t check out until he/she logs in.  In this case, there is still a session ID provided to the user.  When the user does log in, you should regenerate the session ID to prevent session fixation attacks against your web application.</p>

 Session Management in Node.js 

<p>Node.js has become wildly popular over the last 10 years.  With it, several frameworks and session management libraries have cropped up to support it.  Most frameworks use their own session management middleware.  For example, <code>express</code>, the most popular server framework for Node.js, has the accompanying <code>express-session</code> for session management.  Similarly, <code>koa</code> uses <code>koajs/session</code> for its session management.</p>

<p>For this article, I want to focus on <code>express-session</code>, as it is one of the most mature and widely used session management libraries available for Node.js.  For a full rundown of the <code>express-session</code> package, you can view the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme">readme here</a>.  Below are some of the highlights:</p>

<p>Registering the middleware for <code>express-session</code> is very simple.</p>

   <code>var session = require('express-session')
var app = express()

app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  })
);
</code>   

<p>This is the minimum you need to do to get <code>express-session</code> working in a development environment.  As discussed, the secret is used in hashing the session ID, to ensure it isn’t tampered with between the client and the server.  This should be some very long, complex string that is hard to guess.  This string should be rotated periodically to ensure that if it was compromised, it doesn’t stay that way long. The <code>secret</code> can also take an array of secrets to make it even harder to guess.</p>

<p>The <code>resave</code> option enforces that the session is resaved against the server store on each request, even if the session wasn’t modified.  The <code>saveUninitialized</code> property forces a new session to be saved. Both the <code>resave</code> and <code>saveUninitialized</code> options are left to your discretion on how best to implement.  Generally, <code>saveUninitialized: false</code> is used to reduce the session storage on the server for unauthenticated requests.  <code>resave</code> is defaulted to true, but to reduce overhead you can set it to false if your store allows.</p>

<p>Speaking of the store, you notice in this example you haven’t implemented one.  The default server-side session storage is <code>MemoryStore</code>.  According to the documentation, this is purposely not designed for production.  This means it’s fine to leave the above code this way in development, but you should implement a different store in production.  Not doing so can result in memory leaks and does not scale past a single process.  A list of compatible session stores <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session#compatible-session-stores">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The following example uses <code>express-sessions</code> (note sessions instead of session) as a server-side store using MongoDB:</p>

   <code>app.use(
  express.session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new (require('express-sessions'))({
      storage: 'mongodb',
      instance: mongoose,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 27017,
      db: 'test',
      collection: 'sessions',
      expire: 86400
    })
}));
</code>   

<p>Now your application will use your MongoDB instance to store the server session data.  <code>Express-sessions</code> also supports a Redis implementation.  Furthermore, there are many libraries for supporting other databases and in-memory solutions.  Your stack will likely dictate what package you need to use.</p>

<p>Coming back to the security aspect of sessions, you learned that you should expire the session and the cookie.  The example below builds on our working example to do just that.</p>

   <code>app.use(
  express.session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new (require('express-sessions'))({
      storage: 'mongodb',
      instance: mongoose,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 27017,
      db: 'test',
      collection: 'sessions',
      expire: 86400
    }),
  cookie: { maxAge: 2628000000 },
}));
</code>   

<p>In the above expression, only the session ID is stored in the cookie, so you can set the <code>cookie.maxAge</code> value to expire the session and the cookie in one shot.  There is also an option for <code>cookie.expires</code>, however it is recommended that you set the <code>maxAge</code> option instead.</p>

<p>Now from your routes, you should be able to access the <code>session</code> object from your request object.  Earlier you learned that you should regenerate your session after the user logs in.  Let’s take a look at that using express and the <code>ExpressOIDC</code> from Okta.</p>

   <code>const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: {yourOktaDomain} + "/oauth2/default",
  client_id: {yourClientId},
  client_secret: {yourClientSecret},
  appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
  scope: "openid profile",
  routes: {
    login: {
      path: "/users/login",
    },
    callback: {
      path: "/authorization-code/callback",
    },
    loginCallback: {
      afterCallback: "/users/afterLogin",
    },
  },
});

app.use(oidc.router);

app.get("/users/afterLogin", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
  request.session.regenerate(function(err) {
    // will have a new session here
  })
});
</code>   

<p>In the above example, you are registering the <code>ExpressOIDC</code> middleware provided by Okta to handle the login.  After the successful login, you redirect the users to the <code>users/afterLogin</code> router, which then has access to the <code>request</code> object.  <code>Express-session</code> has attached the <code>session</code> object to the request for you and you can use the <code>session</code> API to call <code>regenerate</code>.  This will create a new session for the logged-in users.</p>

<p>Session management is a topic that you could spend days researching and understanding.  As I noted, the session management package you will use in Node.js will largely depend on your stack and your server framework.  However, by becoming familiar with implementing safe and optimized session management in one framework, you can carry that knowledge to all other Node.js frameworks.</p>

 Representing base IP with ERC721 and fungible IP licenses with ERC20, to combine benefits of&nbsp;both  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard. This article links ERC721 &amp; ERC20, and describes how combining them gets benefits of&nbsp;both.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Scenarios <p>There are two big-picture scenarios on how base IP and sub-licenses relate.</p>  Just base IP. This is quite simple. It’s a single artifact and there is no sub-licenses. For example, an artist paints a painting and has a copyright of it. That painting is sold to a collector who then gets exclusive rights to it. The base IP started as copyright held by the painter, then was transferred to the collector.  Sub-licenses against the base IP. This has many varieties. Typically the sub-licenses are fungible. For example, an author writes a book and has copyright of it; he does an exclusive license of this base IP to a publishing house. The house sells 10,000 physical books, each having its own fungible sub-license against the base IP. As a second revenue stream, it might also sell 20,000 e-books, each having its own fungible sub-license (a different license compared to the physical&nbsp;books).   1.2 Implementing Scenarios in Blockchain <p>Here’s how these scenarios might get implemented in blockchain.</p><p>For scenario 1 above, the Single-Edition ERC721 described in Article 1 is appropriate.</p><p>Scenario 2 is much richer, leading to several implementation possibilities. Article 1 described how Limited-Edition ERC721 could be used, and Article 2 described how ERC20 could be used. This article will describe a third approach that combines both. But first let’s do some comparison.</p> 1.3 Comparing ERC721&nbsp;andERC20 <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC721 for limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  EC721 Benefits. First, if history of each unique token matters, and its provenance needs to be traced. Second, user experience is decent, since ERC721 wallets explicitly hold ERC721 tokens and render images alongside the ERC721. ERC721 markets have good price discovery for truly non-fungible assets, typically using auctions.  ERC721 Challenges. Limited-edition ERC721 assumes the tokens are non-fungible, even if the actual asset is fungible IP licenses. This makes the pricing problem harder, because it converts an apples-to-apples comparison into an apples-to-oranges one. Then, it can’t use AMMs and other powerful ERC20 price discovery tools. Finally, limited-edition ERC721 doesn’t model who owns the base IP at all, let alone make it easy to&nbsp;manage.  <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC20 for Limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  ERC20 Benefits. First, tokens can go directly in AMMs which allows automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation. Second, tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to loans. Third, base IP is represented by ERC20.owner address, and therefore it can be transferred and&nbsp;managed.  ERC20 Challenges. While base IP can be transferred and managed, tooling doing so is poor. For example, wallets only store the private key for the ERC20.owner address; it doesn’t show up as a&nbsp;token.  <p>Here’s the key takeaways. First, the benefits of one are roughly the challenges for the other. Second, neither does well in managing base IP. It’s nonexistent for ERC721 and poor for ERC20. Yet managing base IP is extremely important! We want to make it easy for people to sell base IP, have multiple revenue streams against it, link it with physical objects and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;How <p>This section describes at a high level how to combine the benefits of ERC721 and ERC20, and better manage base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The basic idea is to tokenize the base IP and tokenize sub-licenses against it. Let’s bring in specific token standards.</p>  Base IP is non-fungible, so ERC721 is a good way to represent it.  Fungible IP sub-licenses are best represented by fungible token standard ERC20. And, we generalize this to multiple revenue streams against the base IP; some use ERC20, some may use ERC721, and others may use other standards or fully custom approaches [1]. A “good default” is simply&nbsp;ERC20.   1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;Benefits <p>This leads to benefits at a high level, benefits from ERC721, and benefits from ERC20. Here are high-level benefits:</p>  Simple mental model non-fungible base IP → non-fungible token standard, and fungible IP licenses → fungible standard.  Enables multiple revenue streams against the base IP, with different sub-licenses. For example, a book might have a kindle version, softcover print version, and hardcover print version&nbsp;[8].  <p>Base IP inherits benefits of&nbsp;ERC721:</p>  Direct wallet support for base IP. Render images, transfer base IP, versus just holding the private key for ERC20.owner  Sell base IP in marketplaces focusing on ERC721 NFTs, with corresponding price discovery tuned for ERC721. E.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>  Easier to link physical objects with base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.wisekey.com/press/wisekey-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-launch-trustednft-io-a-decentralized-marketplace-for-objects-of-value-designed-to-empower-artists-creators-and-collectors-with-a-unique-solution-for-the-auth/">WISeKey chips in paintings, linked directly to&nbsp;NFTs</a>  Tools to fractionalize ownership of base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.org/">Niftex</a> tool. This allows co-ownership of base IP, such as <a href="https://www.vita-dao.io/">VitaDAO</a> for drug discovery data  <p>Fungible IP sub-licenses inherit benefits of&nbsp;ERC20:</p>  Fungible IP tokens can go directly in AMMs, for automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation.  Fungible IP tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to&nbsp;loans.  <p>This combines the UX benefits of ERC721 with the fungibility benefits of ERC20. ERC20 doesn’t have to be limited-edition either; for example ERC20 tokens (licenses) could be minted on-the-fly.</p><p>At Ocean Protocol for V3, we built an ERC20-based IP framework. We’re now working on ERC721+ERC20 for Ocean&nbsp;V4.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC721+ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 + ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions   To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self, and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata follows<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721"> ERC721Metadata extension</a>. Then, use ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing. The ERC20 can be linked to ERC721 in one of many&nbsp;ways.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [6]. For legals, T&amp;C states that owning ≥1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. Those sub-license rights associated with the given ERC20 contract, not the ERC721 contract.  Base IP: represented by the tuple of {ERC721 deployment, tokenId}.  Base IP holder: represented by the owner of the address at ERC721.owners[tokenId].  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.   2.2 ERC20 + ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC721._safeMint() to claim the base IP, which sets the value at ERC721._owner[tokenId=7] is set to addressP. Then the publisher calls ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint() to mint 3 sub-license tokens with addressP as initial owner; this sets the value at ERC20.owner to addressP, and ERC20.balances value at key addressP is set to&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Step ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract, and work exactly like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling ERC721.safeTransferFrom() which changes ERC721.owners[tokenId=x] to a new&nbsp;address.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 ERC20 + ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The two images below illustrate.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners[tokenId=7] value is addressP, meaning the publisher is the base IP holder. The ERC20._balances attribute holds one entry with key addressP and value 3.0, meaning the publisher holds three sub-licenses.</p><p>The ERC20 can link to the ERC721 in one of many ways. In this example, we riff on ERC20 Ownable mixin with an NftOwnable mixin, replacing ERC20.owner with ERC20.nftOwner that points to the NFT tuple {ERC721 address, tokenId}. Ability to mint ERC20 tokens and other permissions that Ownable gave to the address at ERC20.owner now go to the address at ERC721._owners[tokenId].</p><p>Steps ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract. They only change ERC20._balances variables just like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps. ERC721 state is not&nbsp;changed.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Structure Diagram, steps&nbsp;1–4<p>When ❺ is complete, base IP has been transferred. ERC721.owners[tokenId=7] now holds the value address3 (not shown). The address3 owner now controls ERC20 minting and other permissions.</p>ERC721+ERC20: Structure Diagram, step&nbsp;5 3. Conclusion <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard.</p><p>This article connected IP to ERC721+ERC20 Solidity implementations, and how it combines the benefits of ERC721 and of ERC20 individually.</p> 4. Appendix: Related Approaches  4.1 NFT&nbsp;Vaults <p>This is another approach represent base IP &amp; fractional licenses. Start with ERC20 setup of article 2, but put the private key that owns ERC20.owner attribute into an NFT “vault” using <a href="https://hack.ethglobal.co/showcase/nfwallets-recErbcXq0xNSP8zX">NFwallets</a>, <a href="https://charged.fi/">Charged Particles</a>, or <a href="https://circuitsofvalue.com/">emblem.vault</a>.</p><p>This seems simple at first glance. However, each ERC20’s owner would be represented by a different NFT, which causes ambiguity if only one of those NFTs is transferred. Also, the workflow to publish is clumsier. Finally, the overall mental model is more complex, which hinders adoptability.</p> 4.2 Fractional ownership of&nbsp;ERC721 <p>Base IP can have fractional ownership. Here’s a traditional example: a company holds a patent, and that company has 10 shareholders. Each shareholder therefore has fractional ownership of the base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Standards like <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1633">EIP1633</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2981">EIP2981</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3601">EIP3601</a>, and tools like Niftex allow one to shard ownership of an ERC721 token, where ERC20 tokens represent the fraction of ownership into the ERC721 token. That’s highly useful to shard ownership for base IP, including the setup in this article where base IP is represented by&nbsp;ERC721.</p><p>The main goal of this article is to contemplate representing ERC20 as fungible IP license against ERC721 base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>In short, there are (at least) two complementary ways to use ERC20 in relation to ERC721: ERC20 to shard an ERC721 token, and ERC20 for fungible IP licenses against base ERC721 IP. This article focuses on the&nbsp;latter.</p><p>Interestingly, by using ERC20 for fungible IP licenses, we get fractional ownership of these IP licenses (if decimals &gt; 0, which is usually the&nbsp;case).</p> Acknowledgements <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series acknowledges the many people that have helped towards the whole series, including this article. Thank you&nbsp;again!</p> Notes <p>[1] Having base IP represented as ERC721 tokens is general enough to allow monetization beyond basic ERC20 IP sub-license datatokens. For example, have Superfluid ERC20 datatokens for streaming payments in C2D or subscriptions. Or, have ERC721 IP sub-licenses. Basically anything, since they just point to the&nbsp;ERC721.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">NFTs &amp; IP 3: Combining ERC721 &amp; ERC20</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<br>
<p>Recently, the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/35">first upgrade</a> to the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Azimuth</a> smart contracts which make up Urbit ID was
put up to an <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade proposal vote</a> by the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/senate/">Galactic Senate</a>. This vote is still open and will
last for 30 days (June 20th) or until an absolute majority is reached. We’d like
to take this opportunity to discuss two things. <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#changelist">First</a>, what the
proposed changes are, and <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">second</a>, a review of how Urbit governance
works and where we’re at in the decentralization process.</p>
<p>Before we dive into what the proposed changes are, let’s review what the Senate
is actually capable of changing. Urbit ID is really two sets of smart contracts:
Azimuth and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ecliptic/">Ecliptic</a>. Azimuth is the data of the
public key infrastructure - roughly, this is the list of
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ships</a> and which Ethereum addresses own them, along
with other data such as networking keys and sponsorship status. The Senate has
no ability to touch this data directly. This is in direct contrast to all
existing centralized services, where your account is always at risk of being
taken away from you. What the Senate can change is Ecliptic, which is the
“business logic” that decides how you can interact with the data in Azimuth.
These are mechanisms such as what powers various
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/proxies/">proxies</a> have, how stars/planets are released over
time, and how sponsorship works. Put another way, the data and database format
must remain the same, but the rules by which we interact with it may change
according to the governance rules we <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">detail below</a>.</p>
 Changelist 
<p>The Galactic Senate is voting on the following changes to Ecliptic: </p>
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility  
 Self-modifying proxies  
 Upgraded Claims contract 
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility 
<p>In Ecliptic, the contract includes various functions and events
that make it conform to the ERC721 (non-fungible token) standard. However, two
events have <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/issues/8">ever so slightly
non-confirming</a> descriptions. This
causes Ethereum explorers like Etherscan to incorrectly recognize Azimuth as
ERC20 (fungible token), rather than ERC721.</p>
<p>The proposed change simply modifies the event descriptions to accurately match
the ERC721 definition. This does not affect any functionality within the
contract itself.</p>
 Self-modifying proxies 
<p>Owners of Azimuth assets are allowed to configure "proxy addresses" for those
assets: Ethereum addresses allowed to act "as" the owner, but only for a subset
of operations. For example, setting the management proxy will let you change
your networking keys and sponsor using that address, just like your ownership
address can. This is useful for keeping the ownership keys in very cold storage
while still letting you perform lower-value operations.</p>
<p>Currently, only the ownership address is allowed to change proxy addresses.
Fairly early on after Azimuth's deployment, we realized it might be nice for
proxies to be able to change themselves.</p>
<p>This means that, in addition to being able to configure networking keys and
sponsorship, your management proxy would be able to assign a new management
proxy. This would allow you, or a trusted third party holding your management proxy,
to rotate your proxy keys without needing to take your ownership keys out of cold
storage.</p>
 Upgraded Claims contract 
<p><a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/blob/master/contracts/Claims.sol">The Claims
contract</a>
lets asset managers associate various "claims" with their identity. For
example, an Ethereum address to send donations to, or proving ownership of a
Twitter account.</p>
<p>For ease of use by off-chain tools and services, the contract emits events
(notifications) whenever any claims are updated. However, the current version of
the contract has a bug where it does not emit events when all claims are removed
at once (clearClaims()). This "gap" in the event stream makes it much more
difficult to write off-chain tools around this contract. Considering Claims has
seen <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7e7f69b34d7d9bd8d61fb22c33b22708947971a#events">practically no
use</a>
since it was first deployed, it should not be a problem to simply start over
fresh with a new contract that contains <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/32">the
fix</a> for the described bug.</p>
<p>The reason we must do an Ecliptic upgrade to switch to a new Claims contract, is
that it is tied in with the logic for transferring an asset. If an asset is
flagged for "reset" (common when transferring to/from someone other than
yourself), its configured proxies, networking keys and claims are cleared during
transfer. As such, Ecliptic will need to know about the address of the new
Claims contract.</p>
 Urbit Governance 
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Urbit is to become a digital republic manifested as a peer
to peer network owned and controlled by its users. The goal of Tlon, then, is to
become one of many companies who build products for Urbit rather than being the primary
driving force behind its development. We’d like to take this opportunity to
spell out our perspective on where we’re at in that process. Here are some previous posts that are relevant, but please note that
some of them are several years old and as such may not accurately reflect our
current position, but still serve as useful historical markers. We hope to
revisit and refresh these documents soon. </p>

 Galactic Senate 
<p>The Galactic Senate is composed of all <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/galaxy/">galaxy</a>
holders, which at present consists of more than 100 individuals and a few
organizations, including Tlon and the Urbit Foundation. Using the Azimuth
voting contract, the Senate can present and vote on two kinds of proposals:
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/docvote/">document proposals</a> and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade
proposals</a>. Thus far, all matters which the Senate
has voted on have been document proposals. The <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/34">most recent
vote</a> declared the Urbit network as
(i) being secure (as confirmed by a <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/security-audit/">third party
audit</a>) and (ii) having reached continuity (as in, no
further <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/breach/">network breaches</a> are expected). Previous votes
were to declare that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/25">Azimuth is live</a>
and that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/24">Arvo is stable</a>.</p>
 Address space distribution 
<p>Perhaps the most informative measure of how decentralized Urbit is in terms of
how many independent parties hold address space. By the very nature of Urbit, it
is impossible to know this with great accuracy (a common feature of
decentralized projects). However, the movement of galaxies is closely watched
and thus we have a fairly good idea of how distributed they are.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Urbit’s creator Curtis Yarvin was in possession of the entire
address space - all 256 galaxies, and everything underneath it. A network of one
is no network at all, and so over the last decade Urbit’s development has been
primarily driven by selling or giving away these galaxies. On <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-urbit-address-space/">June 1,
2016</a>, the allocation was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95, to the Tlon Corporation. 50, to urbit.org, the future community
foundation. 40, to Tlon employees and their family members (24 to Curtis, who
started in 2002; 16 to everyone else, who started in 2014). 34, to outside
investors in Tlon. 37, to 33 other individuals, who donated to the project,
contributed code or services, won a contest, or were just in the right place
at the right time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then, Tlon has sold a number of
its galaxies to fund development and others have changed hands to the point
that Tlon and urbit.org no longer possess a majority share of galaxies. In
January 2019, <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/a-founders-farewell/">Curtis gave all of his galaxies</a> to
Tlon when he left the project. In August 2020 we shared an update on the <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/value-of-address-space-pt3/">known
distribution of address space</a>, where
Curtis’ galaxies are marked as Tlon’s “naked galaxies”. Shortly thereafter, Tlon
disbursed its naked galaxies among the employees that wanted one who did not
already possess one, thus removing Tlon and urbit.org’s controlling share of the
Senate. Galaxies held by current and former Tlon employees are entirely
independent of Tlon Corporation—they may do with them, and vote with them, as
they please. <code>~ravmel-ropdyl</code> plans to give more color to this decision in the
near future.</p>
<p>Distribution of stars is much more difficult to know. There is an active market
for stars on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id">OpenSea</a>, so we know that
they are changing hands frequently, but checking the number of distinct Ethereum
addresses that hold stars does not tell you very much information since a single person can control multiple adresses.</p>
 Software and smart contracts 
<p>As was written in <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">The DAO as a Lesson in Decentralized
Governance</a>,
we are keenly aware of the threat of decentralization theater. Urbit has
undergone steady progress towards decentralization, and with the developments we
outline below, it’s never been more clear that the project is beginning to leave
the cradle of Tlon. It’s also important to note that the decentralization of a
project is always a movement away from an initial centralized state⁠—you cannot
go from A to Z without first traversing every letter in between. While Urbit was
centralized at the beginning, the journey towards a network owned and
controlled by the users is now well underway.</p>
<p>In the past, nearly all Urbit software was written by Tlon. While Tlon is still the only corporation actively updating Urbit’s MIT-licensed open source software, namely <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> (the runtime), and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Arvo</a> (the kernel), unaffiliated individuals have been making enormous contributions to Urbit over the past couple of years via the <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/history">grants program</a>. Recent examples include the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4940">Bitcoin node and wallet integration</a>, <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/21131866-webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app">WebRTC integration</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arthyn/port">Port, an Urbit installer and ship manager</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4820"><code>|fuse</code>, an important primitive for 3rd party software distribution</a>.</p>
<p>The only real power Tlon holds over Urbit is the ability to push <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA
updates</a> via <code>~zod</code>, and suggest that people
download our binaries. To the best of our knowledge, all extant galaxies
retrieve their OTA updates from <code>~zod</code>, who forward it to their stars, who
forward it to their planets. This software distribution route is merely a
convenient default setting. Ships initially retrieve OTA updates from their
sponsor, but they have full authority to retrieve updates from whoever they want
with the <code>|ota</code> command, or even to only install software updates by hand if
they so choose.</p>
<p>In the future, one can easily imagine many organizations shipping their own
distributions of Urbit from their own urbit nodes, somewhat analogously to the
large number of Linux distributions which exist today. There is nothing we can
do to stop a group from forking Urbit, declaring <code>~sampel-palnet</code> the new <code>~zod</code>
(both for updates and for sponsorship purposes), and retrieving all OTA updates
via that route and building their own binaries. This is all by design, and we
wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>The use of the Azimuth smart contracts is also somewhat optional. By changing a
few lines of code to point their ships at another set of PKI smart contracts,
they could rid themselves of hierarchical peer discovery entirely and make use
of some other routing strategy such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia based DHT
routing</a>. This would likely give rise to
an entirely separate network. The fact that the network is fully capable of such
a schism helps keep the Senate honest and accountable to the users. If they ever
were to vote on a contract modification that greatly angered or upset a portion
of the user base, they would be inviting such a schism and be entirely deserving
of it. In that sense, the power to control the network is already held by the
users, they just have not yet had a reason to make use of it.</p>
 Legitimacy 
<p>The only way by which Tlon and the Senate hold any power is via legitimacy.
Vitalik Buterin recently wrote a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">very informative
article</a> on the role of
legitimacy in decentralized governance, and I do not know of a better source to
understand how Tlon and the Senate are kept in check by the users. Besides the
DAO split resulting in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic mentioned in the article,
perhaps the most prominent example of the power users have over a decentralized
network is the saga of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power">Steem and Justin
Sun</a>.
The short version of the story is that Justin Sun bought a controlling share of
the Steem blockchain and attempted to exert control over it, and the users
banded together to fork the blockchain into one called Hive, which was identical
to Steem except with Sun’s token balance set to zero. An analogous outcome for
Urbit would be that the Senate makes sweeping changes to the PKI and invites a
schism like that outlined above.</p>
<p>For these reasons, there are strong disincentives for any one organization or
individual to acquire too many galaxies. If galaxy owenship becomes more centralized, individuals will be less incentivized to build on the network which will reduce the value of address space. Furthermore, such centralization might provoke a fork if such centralized powers are perceived as malicious by the users. This is in contrast to real-life republics, where there is little risk
for one party to accumulate as much power as they can manage since the cost to
the citizens to overthrow that power is enormous. Thus, only especially
egregious displays of power ever result in rebellion. Within the Urbit republic,
users need only to change the code they run to leave the Senate powerless, and
so the threat of rebellion is much more real. We estimate that within a digital
republic like Urbit, the centrifugal forces outweigh the centripetal forces, and
that the outcome of this is more stable than the reverse.</p>
 Why have governance at all? 
<p>An important question the reader may still have lingering is: why does Urbit
need governance at all? The short answer is: (i) there will always be necessary
protocol upgrades that cannot be foreseen, and (ii) a total lack of governance
inevitably gives rise to a shadow government with undefined powers that is
almost impossible to hold accountable.</p>
<p>With (ii), we see this to be the case on many early blockchain projects where
power is shared by the developers and the miners, but what each is capable of
doing has never been codified, and thus users of the blockchain can never have a
great deal of certainty of what changes might occur in the future. This doesn’t
guarantee a bad outcome, but it does create more wariness among developers when they cannot know whether they really have a say in
the project's direction. Recognizing this issue, many newer blockchain and
blockchain-adjacent projects have built-in governance mechanisms that lay out
exactly what an individual can expect should they join and contribute to that
network.</p>
<p>As for (i), with Urbit being a wholly new kind of network, it would take
incredible luck to get the PKI exactly right on the very
first try without ever needing another modification. Thus, some mechanism was
needed to guarantee that the PKI’s logic could be altered. Leaving control of
Azimuth in the hands of Tlon would have just granted Tlon dictatorial power, which Tlon nor Urbit users desired. There’s certainly
room to argue that the Galactic Senate is not a perfect system: our interim
constitution did outline potential roles for stars and planets to play in
governance in the future, so there is ample opportunity for the system to evolve
in response to the will of the users. As always, it is important to keep in mind
the unfinished nature of the Urbit of today and the still moldable clay of the
Urbit of tomorrow⁠—nothing yet is set in stone.</p>

<p>A lot of what I've shared recently has been about Holo hosting -- getting all the bits really robust so they handle both 'happy path' user interactions (everything is working as expected) and 'sad path' ones (HoloPort goes down, login fails, etc). But I haven't spent much time talking about how Holochain itself is improving -- and when I have, it's usually been about bugfixes to support the aforementioned Holo work.</p><p>But behind the scenes, Holochain has been getting some big upgrades to some of its parts. This is mainly to make it faster -- fast enough for the next stages of Elemental Chat testing. (And of course, Elemental Chat testing is really about Holo hosting and Holochain.)</p> LMDB to SQLite: the road to infinite scalability <p>A lot of peer-to-peer networks, from decentralised social networks like <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> to blockchains like Bitcoin, are built on something called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">gossip protocol</a>'. It's a simple protocol, and it works like it sounds like it would work: I know a bunch of people (or rather, computers), and when one of my friends shares something with me I share it with everyone else I know. With this protocol, messages spread rapidly through networks without a central authority.</p><p>And it also creates a lot of network traffic. That might be fine for blockchains, in which every machine is online most of the time and needs to know about everything anyway. But for networks that power everyday applications, you want to be respectful of your users' bandwidth -- and you can't expect their machines to be on all the time either. (Even blockchains tweak gossip to make it more efficient.)</p><p>Holochain is based on the idea of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">'neighbourhoods' of authority</a> -- each piece of data gets an address, and it's only sent to a group of machines that have taken responsibility for the range of addresses that cover its address. That means traditional gossip is too chatty -- as an authority, you need to constantly make decisions about what to share with your neighbours, given that they aren't responsible for the exact same range that you are.</p><p>It gets more complicated when machines are turning on and off all the time (which happens a lot when they're just users' devices). A machine that's been offline for a while will want to get up to date with the latest gossip, and will ask its peers for a digest of new stuff since they were last online.</p><p>This means you have to be able to ask your own database questions like "which of my neighbours' responsibility ranges start before, and end after, address <code>531993928</code>?" and "what new data have I collected within my neighbour Alice's responsibility range <code>112513216</code> to <code>241661317</code> since yesterday morning at 08:37 UTC?" These sorts of questions, called range queries, are really hard for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database">key/value database</a> like <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">LMDB</a> to answer, but they're really easy for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a> like <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>.</p><p>Because all data in Holochain is just keys (addresses) and values attached to those keys, LMDB initially made sense -- it was much faster than any relational database out there when it came to key/value lookups, as well as being gentle on CPU and RAM. But as the core developers started looking at <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">sharding</a>, it became obvious that the large amount of range queries would hurt performance unacceptably if they stuck with LMDB.</p><p>As a side bonus, SQLite also makes it possible for us to encrypt source chain and DHT data at rest using <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">SQLCipher</a>. (Note: this doesn't prevent you from reading your peers' published data -- that's not how Holochain works. But it does prevent an attacker from stealing it if they gain access to your computer.)</p> Other gossip upgrades <p>As mentioned, when machines come back online after being offline for a while, the catching-up process has been pretty network-heavy. Now when it happens, machines <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/752">compare their lists</a> of held data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filters</a>. This technique results in more back-and-forth messages between nodes but less data being exchanged overall. This is already speeding up syncing, even though sharding is yet to be introduced.</p> New versions of Wasmer and Rust <p><a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> engine we're using to run the 'rules' of a Holochain app, is now at version 1.0, so we've <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/801">upgraded it</a>. It comes with better memory management, a faster compiler and runtime, and a bunch of bug fixes. It also lets us compile and run Holochain on ARM CPUs like the HoloPort Nano.</p><p>Wasmer 1.0 will also let us implement compute metering for Holo hosting, as well as runtime budgets to prevent infinite loops from <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/halting-problem/">chewing up all of a host's CPU capacity</a>.</p><p>A new version of the Rust programming language has been released as well, so we've upgraded Holochain to use that too.</p><p>As a side effect, macOS developers are now first-class citizens again -- these updates plus some bugfixes have <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/pull/212">resolved</a> the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/issues/211">macOS build issues</a> for Holonix, our development environment.</p> What's next? <p>Wasmer 1.0 and Rust 1.52 have already been integrated into Holochain, and they'll be rolled out along with the SQLite update. Expect to see faster install times soon too; we're researching automated build servers for Holonix so you don't have to wait an hour for everything to compile!</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/767">work of integrating SQLite is done</a>, and the slower performance of key/value lookups is more than offset by the faster performance of range queries. It's currently being tested on a single HoloPort with an automated Elemental Chat test involving 20 hosted users and one self-hosted instance, which has revealed a bug related to clogged processing queues. If there are no other show-stopper bugs, it'll replace the current LMDB-based Holochain on all HoloPorts soon.</p><p>Now that this work is almost ready, the core devs have been able to work on sharding the DHT. So far it's been 'full-sync', which means everybody stores everything, a lot like a blockchain. This is good for redundancy but bad for performance (although community testers have been consistently talking about how fast Elemental Chat already is). So far they've completed about half of the tasks involved in sharding.</p><p>Sharding has always been part of our promise to make dApps fast and scalable, so I'm excited to see this happening.</p> Reminder: Register for Dev Camp! <p>The next community-led <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Dev Camp is starting at the end of June</a>. The project you'll be working on, a game called Tragedy of the Holocommons, will help you understand how to design an app that works well without a single source of truth. I think it's a brilliant idea.</p><p>Dev Camps are still free, and they’re run by a fantastic and knowledgeable group of volunteers.</p><p>The Holochain developer community is growing, along with the ecosystem of learning materials and open-source libraries, tools, and apps.

<p>Whether your company uses direct deposit or other direct payments through the ACH network, you’re likely leveraging WEB debit transfers in some way. And if you’re using WEB debits, you should be adhering to Nacha’s WEB debit rule. Doing so will not only keep you on good terms with Nacha, but it’s also an opportunity to enhance payment experiences and protect your company. Here’s how.</p>
 How Prevalent Is ACH Fraud? 
<p>Nacha’s WEB (meaning internet-initiated entry) debit compliance rules are designed to protect both the ACH network and your company from rising ACH fraud. The <a href="https://www.afponline.org/publications-data-tools/reports/survey-research-economic-data/Details/payments-fraud/">Association of Finance Professionals</a> (AFP) 2020 Payments Fraud and Control Survey Report found that 81% of businesses were targets of payments fraud and 55% of businesses were directly impacted by ACH fraud, with 33% of that fraud from ACH debits and 22% from ACH credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud usually occurs when a criminal accesses a customer’s account and submits an unauthorized ACH transaction. In the past, all a criminal needed was an account number and a bank routing number. How many abandoned checkbooks might be floating around in the landfill, waiting for an eager fraudster?</p>
<p>With a third of businesses falling victim to ACH WEB debit fraud, it’s no wonder Nacha is updating its rules to protect both the ACH network and your company.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Nacha WEB Debit Compliance Rules? 
<p>Nacha has established operating rules that keep the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/what-is-ach-6-fundamentals-to-get-you-started/">ACH network</a> secure. As part of those operating rules, originators of WEB debit entries must use a “commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection system” to screen those debit transactions for fraud. What that detection system specifically looks like has been largely up to the businesses initiating ACH transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nacha <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">has recently augmented this requirement</a> and now specifically requires that the “fraudulent transaction detection system” includes account validation. Under the new rule, an account must be validated with the first use of the account number, or after any changes to the account number. This updated rule aims to cut down on the WEB debit fraud that continues to climb.</p>
 When Do Businesses Need to Be in Compliance? 
<p>Nacha had originally set January 1, 2020, as the effective date for the new WEB debit rule. The Board of Directors then approved an extension to March 19, 2021 to allow businesses to educate themselves and implement the new processes. As of now, the WEB debit rule is in effect. Originators of WEB debit payments have one year from the effective date of the rule to implement an account validation solution.</p>
 How Can You Ensure Your Payments Are Compliant? 
<p>To be compliant with Nacha’s WEB debit rule, your payment solution must include some form of account validation. This validation can take several Nacha-approved forms:</p>
 
 Prenotification entry: The payment originator sends a zero-dollar entry through the ACH network to the account several days prior to the live entry. 
 Micro-deposit verification: Small amounts—usually between a couple cents and a dollar—are sent to an account and must be verified by the account holder. 
 Instant account validation: The customer provides consent to access their account information, ideally through a direct API connection to the customer’s financial institution. Of these verification methods, instant account validation delivers the most accurate information in real time and doesn’t rely on the customer manually keying their account and routing information. They simply log in to their account and provide consent for the validation. 
 
<p>Nacha also notes that companies may leverage other validation means. For example, proving that an account has a reliable history of prior successful payments may act as a sufficient validation. Ultimately, Nacha recognizes that every company’s position and situation is unique, and so determining whether an account validation method is “commercially reasonable” will differ, and each company should consult their own attorneys, risk department, or other advisors to ensure the validation method is compliant.</p>
 How Finicity’s Instant Account Verification Prevents Fraud and Enables A Better User Experience 
<p>Through our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity Pay</a><a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/"></a>&nbsp;solution set, we offer instant account validation that satisfies Nacha’s updated WEB debit rule and provides additional valuable data to improve the experience and efficiency of ACH payments. Our instant account validation enables money movers to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner verification, and balance checks to streamline and secure ACH payments. And with easy and fast consumer permissioning, our validation solution empowers consumers to benefit from their own data to have better financial services experiences.</p>
<p>In addition to validating account information, the consumer-permissioned data Fincity’s open banking platform provides can be used to check balances prior to processing payments to avoid fees and returns due to insufficient funds. It can also support Know Your Customer (KYC) by providing the name and address of the account owner on file at the financial institution. While this data is useful for payments, it can also be leveraged in account opening, digital wallet or prepaid card funding, or other use cases where similar information is needed.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Nacha has named Finicity a Preferred Partner, which guarantees that our validation solution aligns with Nacha’s core strategies to advance the ACH networks. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">According to Nacha</a>, those who are preferred partners:</p>

<p>What are push attacks? Push attacks are used by malicious actors whose goal is to get past mobile push-based multi-factor authentication (MFA). The malicious actor spams the victim with notifications to authenticate until they are fatigued and finally accept it. When deployed on a mass scale, even a low success rate of <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-2-factor-authentication-isnt-foolproof/">less than 3% is significant.</a></p>
      
<p>Push attacks are a growing concern among security experts, and many of today’s MFA solutions offer push authentication as a form of MFA. That’s why the latest HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12 offers a technology preview of QR code login.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>No Passwords, No Push, Just Scan QR to Log In</p>
      
 HYPR’s QR Code Login 
      
<p>6.12 now enables users to log into their SSO-managed web apps by scanning a QR code with the HYPR App or camera on their smartphone.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is a passwordless MFA alternative in situations where push notifications to the mobile device aren’t available, or undesirable from a security standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Before partnering with HYPR, a higher education customer struggled to secure their 3,500-person University campus with their existing password-based login and potential push-related security risks. Push fatigue inadvertently allowed access to another user who correctly guessed the victim’s username and spammed their account for a push authentication.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is impactful because it prevents push fatigue and its potential for push attacks. It gives more control to the end-user as they initiate their authentication by scanning the code rather than waiting for a push notification to arrive on their smartphone.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Device pairing is still required to register a trusted device, so the QR code will only prompt the user to verify their identity with their registered device.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12</p>
      
<p>In addition to QR code login, another notable update includes our API Endpoint Security Enhancement feature. This feature further improves the overall security posture across components of the HYPR Cloud Platform by passing an encrypted token to the HYPR Server when making internal API calls.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>To learn more about what 6.12 has to offer, read our latest release notes for <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/installinghypr/docs/workforce-access-6120">Workforce Access 6.12</a> and <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/integratinghypr/docs/customer-authentication-6120">Customer Authentication 6.12</a>.

 Representing Intellectual Property rights via ERC20 for AMM-based price discovery and&nbsp;more  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard. This article focuses on the ERC20 fungible token standard for blockchain * IP, and describes how it helps price discovery and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Article 3</a> links ERC721 &amp;&nbsp;ERC20.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Fungibility &amp; Price Discovery <p>Apple-apple. If you have two identical apples side by side, and one sells for $0.75, then you can readily establish the price of the other apple as $0.75. You can swap them for each other and it doesn’t matter. That is, they’re fungible. With gold, one ounce of can be swapped for another; it’s fungible. Same for TSLA stock. Same for Bitcoin. Same for ERC20 tokens (fungible token standard).</p><p>Apple-orange. If you have an apple and an orange side-by-side, and the apple sells for $2, you still don’t have much information to price the orange. The apple and orange can’t be swapped for each other. They’re non-fungible. This makes them harder to price. An ounce of gold can’t be swapped for an ounce of silver; it’s non-fungible. A one-of-a-kind painting can’t be swapped with another painting; it’s non-fungible. Same for ERC721 tokens (non-fungible token standard).</p><p>Price discovery. Of the two scenarios above, it’s easier to price apples to apples, rather than apples to oranges, because “apples to apples” are fungible. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this: fungibility greatly helps price discovery. It’s easier to price ERC20 tokens <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1353091225897869312">than ERC721</a>&nbsp;[1].</p> 1.2 Fungible IP&nbsp;Licenses <p>When a publisher prints a book, they print thousands or millions of copies. Coming off the press, each of those copies can be swapped for another. They’re fungible.</p><p>Open up a book to one of the first pages and you’ll find information about the place of publication, and what printing round it was. Importantly, you’ll also see the well-known copyright © symbol, and the name of the base IP rights holder. This matters because the physical copy of that book includes a license to use that copyrighted material, that base IP. Holding that book in your hands gives you physical access to use that IP. A printed book includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>If you rent a movie from Amazon Prime, you’re getting a license to the IP of that movie, that base IP. You get digital access to it for 48 hours. Over time, millions of people may rent that movie, i.e. license that base IP. A rented movie includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>Consider a weather station recording temperature, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, and air pressure over years. The weather station owners hold this dataset as IP, and license it to thousands of weather-prediction agencies throughout the world. Each license is just like the other licenses. A weather data license is a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>There are plenty more examples in music, video games, photographs, and more. It goes beyond copyright IP; it happens for trademark IP and patent IP as well, anytime there is more than one swappable license.</p><p>Fungible IP licenses may have limited or unlimited editions. Limited edition use cases are around collectibles and the art world. Unlimited edition use cases include licensing stock photos, renting movies, buying e-books, and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.2 ERC20&nbsp;Standard <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20</a> is a fungible token standard. It’s the most popular standard for tokens, fungible or otherwise.</p><p>Most crypto wallets support ERC20. AMM DEXes exploit ERC20 fungibility property for price discovery, to great success: they now have have billions in daily volume. It’s not just for exchanges; the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance"> DeFi</a> community has developed tools for loans, stablecoins, insurance and more, all around ERC20. Even many non-Ethereum chains support&nbsp;ERC20.</p><p>If one wants to tokenize fungible assets, ERC20 is a good&nbsp;choice.</p> 1.3 Fungible IP Licenses via&nbsp;ERC20 <p>IP licenses can be fungible; and ERC20 is the leading fungible token standard. Then, ERC20 is a logical choice to represent fungible IP licenses. The NFT<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70"> field</a> uses it accordingly; let’s review some examples.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_%28musician%29">RAC’s</a><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape"> $TAPE</a> token is an example using ERC20. Here, 1.0 TAPE tokens are used to<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-democratization-of-value"> redeem</a> a music license in a cassette medium.<a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc85cdd3240385af9958ef99bc2ff0c4de5640bcb"> TAPE is on Uniswap AMM</a>, enabling price discovery to around <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4K per token</a> these&nbsp;days.</p><p><a href="https://unisocks.exchange/">$SOCKS</a> is another example, where SOCKS tokens redeem a pair of socks. Or, <a href="https://www.saintfame.com/fame">$FAME</a> and<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/introducing-bankless-apparel"> $BAP</a> are used to redeem t-shirts. While the focus is on the physical artifact, each has an associated copyright design. AMM price discovery has led to a single $SOCKS edition hitting $164K, and $thousands for $FAME and $BAP. These are exciting use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The above are example one-off tokens. <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> scales this, as a platform that makes it easy to publish, stake/swap and redeem<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837"> ERC20 tokens for IP</a> with appropriate<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> legals</a>. It uses<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3"> AMMs for price discovery, liquidity, and curation</a>. Ocean Market is a reference marketplace; more than a dozen teams have forked its Apache2 frontend code to make their own blockchain IP markets for their own&nbsp;niche.</p> 1.4 *Non* Fungible IP Licenses &amp;&nbsp;ERC20 <p>In the book example above, the author got copyright for their book committing their creative writing to paper. The author could then print many copies of the book themselves, as fungible licenses. However, printing books may not be the author’s forte. So they’d typically do an exclusive license of the base IP to the publishing house; then, the house prints the books as fungible sub-licenses.</p><p>Same for music. The musician could license their works directly to their thousands of listeners. Traditionally this has been hard, so musicians would typically do an exclusive license of the base IP (“master tape”) then the label would do fungible sub-licensing to listeners etc. The exclusive licensee takes over the rights that the copyright holder had initially.</p><p>ERC20 has a means to represent the owner of this base IP (copyright / exclusive license): the address that controls ERC20.owner [4]. We elaborate below.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP <p>This section describes how ERC20 code-level behavior maps to an IP framing. To emphasize similarity to the limited-edition ERC721 approach given in the first article, here we use an example on limited-edition ERC20 (vs. unlimited edition; without loss of generality).</p> 2.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition ERC20s means there are several licenses (editions) for the same base IP. Here’s how to implement.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC20.constructor(), and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata is stored as an<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1046.md"> extension to ERC20</a> or in a<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/metadata/Metadata.sol"> separate contract</a>. Then, ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [2]. For legals, the T&amp;C states that owning 1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. In deploying the ERC20, one could set decimals=0 to represent exactly 1 license always. Even better, if we set decimals=18 we allow fractional ownership of licenses [3], and enable the token to work for AMMs, loans, etc (a big&nbsp;plus).  Base IP: represented by the ERC20 address from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: Stored in ERC20.owner. This means that ERC20 gives a convenient way to identify the base IP&nbsp;holder.  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.  <p>It’s important that the tokens of a given ERC20 contract can only redeem a single type of license / item, otherwise it inadvertently replaces the semantic meaning of the ERC20 token itself (“it’s a license”) with simply being a unit-of-exchange token.</p> 2.2 Limited-Edition ERC20: Management of Base&nbsp;IP <p>ERC20 tokens themselves are for management of IP licenses. Interestingly, the setup supports managing the underling base IP (copyright or exclusive license). Here’s&nbsp;how.</p><p>First, recall that base IP ownership is stored in a state variable (ERC20.owner). So, one can transfer base IP ownership by changing its value to a new address via<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a>. Base IP ownership is fractional when a multisig wallet or DAO controls the address. Value can accrue to base IP before any licenses are created, ie before ERC20 tokens are minted. To monetize with &gt;1 license types (e.g. e-book vs print book), create one ERC20 contract for each license type, each with the same base&nbsp;IP.</p> 2.3 Limited-Edition ERC20: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC20.constructor() method to claim the base IP, then ERC20.mint() to mint 3 tokens with addressP as initial owner. The ERC20’s owner attribute (an address) gets updated to addressP, and its balances attribute (a mapping) gets updated to 3.0 at index addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of one edition, from Publisher to Licensee1 (address1). ERC20.balances gets updated: the value at addressP is decremented by 1.0, and the value at address1 gets set to&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Licensee1 to Licensee2. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Publisher to Licensee3. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a> which changes ERC20.owner to a new address. (Note: this step wasn’t shown for Limited-Edition ERC721 because it’s not possible in that&nbsp;setup.)</p>ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.4 Limited-Edition ERC20: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the value of ERC20.owner is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP holder. ERC20._balances indicates that addressP is the only holder of sub-licenses (3 of&nbsp;them).</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), addressP owner has 2 sub-licenses(from 3) and address1 owner has 1 sub-license (from&nbsp;0).</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then addressP, address2, and address3 owners have 1 sub-license each. The Base IP holder remains addressP&nbsp;owner.</p><p>When Completed ❺, the Base IP holder has changed, to address3 owner (not&nbsp;shown).</p>ERC20: UML Structure Diagram 3. Auto Price Discovery in ERC20&nbsp;IP <p>When ERC20 tokens represent IP licenses, then AMMs and other ERC20 &amp; DeFi tools can help tremendously with automatic price discovery, liquidity and curation. The image below illustrates.</p><p>The ERC20 IP tokens may initially be distributed in an AMM (image: top right), Dutch Auctions,<a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq"> LBPs</a>, or any mechanic used for traditional Initial Coin Offerings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering">ICOs</a>). These tokens may go on to secondary markets in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange"> DEXes</a> like AMMs (image: bottom right) or<a href="https://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Centralized_Exchanges_%28CEX%29"> CEXes</a>. Being ERC20-based allows for IP index funds (<a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1339534813330628612">example</a>), IP loans, IP-backed stablecoins, and ERC20 DeFi tools applied to&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The DEXes and CEXes naturally allow for automatic price discovery and liquidity. Fees and airdrops incentivize providing liquidity. The amount of liquidity in a particular IP’s pool is a useful curation signal — the more stake the higher the quality of the IP&nbsp;asset.</p>ERC20: Structure Diagram showing automatic price discovery 5.

<p><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/">Write the Docs Portland 2021</a> has concluded, and I wanted to share a couple of key insights and observations from the conference.</p><p>First, it was fun, a wonderfully nice group of people, and a well-organized event. Virtual conferences are new for many events and Write the Docs pulled it off really well.</p> Docs as Code <p>One repeated theme throughout the conference was technical writers embracing git-based workflows. Writers can more easily collaborate with developers when they work on documentation iteratively. Benefits include avoiding a rush to document at the last minute before a release, less out-of-band communication to understand upcoming changes, and less tooling across an organization.</p><p>The cost is that technical writers must learn git, git-based workflows, and plain-text formats, but the benefits are significant, and many writers are learning or already actively using these tools.</p><p>Write the Docs has a page with more information on <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">Docs as Code</a>.</p> Evolutionary Documentation <p>One of the more striking talks at the conference was “Always complete, never finished” given by Daniele Procida. The <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/speakers/#speaker-daniele-procida">talk summary</a> states it best:</p><blockquote>an incremental, evolutionary way of working on large documentation tasks that makes every step, from the very first one, a value-adding improvement</blockquote><p>Large documentation refactors taken as a single task can be stressful, time-consuming, and may be out-of-date before they are complete. Instead, documentation can evolve in iterative steps that each improve the overall quality of the documentation.</p><p>Notice the iterative nature of this process and how it relates to Docs as Code. Yes, they are synergistic and work together nicely.</p> Vale: A syntax-aware linter for prose <p>As documentation matures, consistent style and tone grow in importance, and many organizations adopt a style guide or develop their own. While these rules are needed, it can be bothersome and inefficient to need to refer to the style guide manually to keep writing consistent.</p><p>One unconference session was devoted to <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale">Vale</a>, a tool that lints prose based on the rules in a style guide. I love a good code linter, and this tool looks fantastic for prose.</p><p>The Vale ecosystem seems great and includes:</p>  A GitHub action: <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action">GitHub - errata-ai/vale-action: The official GitHub Action for Vale -- install, manage, and run Vale with ease.</a>  A VSCode extension: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server">Vale - Visual Studio Marketplace</a>  Emacs support: <a href="https://github.com/abingham/flycheck-vale">GitHub - abingham/flycheck-vale: Flycheck integration for the vale natural language linter</a>  A nix package: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=20.09&amp;show=vale&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=vale">NixOS Search</a>  <p>It can be used on a variety of plain text formats, comments in code in many languages, and some GUI-based tools (with a paid subscription). See the <a href="https://docs.errata.ai/vale/scoping#formats">complete list of supported formats</a>.</p> So Many More <p>These were just a few of the great things from Write the Docs this year, but there were so many more! All of the talks should now be posted to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr019846MitZUEhc6apDdcQ">Write the Docs YouTube channel</a>.</p> <p>Brian is part of the Developer Success team at Fission and spends a lot of time improving our <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">guide</a> and making better code examples and other ways to help developers succeed in using Fission.</p>

 Elliptic’s analysis of blockchain transactions reveals that a Hamas-linked terrorist group has received a surge of Bitcoin donations since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza clashes. Over $100,000 in Bitcoin donations have now been received by the Al-Qassam Brigades since January 2019. We show how the transparency of the blockchain allows this activity to be monitored and disrupted.

 Compare and Contrast — IRMA vs Verifiable Credentials IRMA vs&nbsp;VC<p>Self-sovereign identity, the next step in the evolution of identity management, revolves around empowering users to own their identity and control how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Given the many concerns revolving around privacy and data sharing that exist today, SSI is being increasingly seen as a potential solution for secure sharing, privacy, and interoperability in the digital world. As a result, the last few years have seen the development of many systems and frameworks to bring SSI closer to&nbsp;reality.</p><p>In this article, we will be comparing two such SSI-based systems, namely, “I Reveal My Attributes” (IRMA) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p> What is&nbsp;IRMA? <p>IRMA was founded by the Digital Security Research group at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. The aim of this group was to create open, secure, and privacy-friendly systems that would give users complete control over their identity.</p><p>This pilot project was called IRMA and it was based on the Idemix technology.</p><p>Idemix is a public-private key pair where the private key is used by the issuer to sign a credential and the public key is used by the verifier to establish that the credential is signed by the issuer and hence is authentic.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable credentials</a>, or VC in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.   Underlying Cryptography <p>Both IRMA and VCs can use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> as their cryptographic foundation, but they use different cryptographic frameworks. While IRMA uses Idemix, many VC implementations rely on the Charm framework.</p><p>Idemix is a Java library while Charm is a Python API that works well for key pairings and signature schemes. The Charm Framework uses a hybrid design that combines mathematical operations in the C language with crypto modules written in high-level languages.</p><p>When you compare the two, Charm is a more advanced crypto framework that supports rapid prototyping. It also reduces the development time and allows the components to be reused. It comes with standard APIs as well that are conducive for digital signatures and encryption.</p> Schemas <p>The schemas used by IRMA and VCs are vastly different too, as VCs use the more popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a type of identifier to enable digital identity. The advantage with DIDs is that it gives users complete control over the usage of verifiable credentials, but the disadvantage is that it lends to the creation of different custom&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Here’s how a VC schema looks&nbsp;like.</p> {<br>  "type": "<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/schema/1.0/schema.json">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/schema/1.0/schema.json</a>",<br>  "modelVersion": "1.0",<br>  "id": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T;id=06e126d1-fa44-4882-a243-1e326fbe21db;version=1.0",<br>  "name": "PassportCredentialSchema",<br>  "author": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T",<br>  "authored": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",<br>  "schema": {<br>    "$schema": "<a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#">http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#</a>",<br>    "description": "Passport",<br>    "type": "object",<br>    "properties": {<br>      "PassportNumber": {<br>        "type": "number",<br>      }<br>       “DateofIssue": {<br>        "type": "date",<br>        }<br>        “FirstName": {<br>        "type": "string",<br>        }<br>         “LastName": {<br>        "type": "string",<br>        }<br>    },<br>    "required": ["passportNumber", “dateofIssue”, “firstName”, “lastName”],<br>    "additionalProperties": false<br>  },<br>  "proof": {<br>      "created": "2019-09-27T06:26:11Z",<br>      "creator": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T#key-1",<br>      "nonce": "0efba23d-2987-4441-998e-23a9d9af79f0",<br>      "signatureValue": "2A7ZF9f9TWMdtgn57Y6dP6RQGs52xg2QdjUESZUuf4J9BUnwwWFNL8vFshQAEQF6ZFBXjYLYNU4hzXNKc3R6y6re",<br>      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018"<br>  }  "proof": {<br>    "type": "RsaSignature2018",<br>    "created": "2020-09-14T21:19:10Z",<br>    "proofPurpose": "authentication",<br>    "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#keys-1",<br>    <br>    "challenge": "1f44d55f-f161-4938-a659-f8026467f126",<br>    "domain": "4jt78h47fh47",<br>    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..kTCYt5      XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVIw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgREEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qq_PbChOMqs LfRoPsnsgxD-WUcX16dUOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPktb3rk-BuQy72IFLN25DYuNzVBAh<br>      4vGHSrQyHUGlcTwLtjPAnKb78"<br>  }<br>} <p>IRMA’s approach to schemas is a stark contrast to VC. It uses a more centralized approach and IRMA has published its schemas on GitHub. Those wanting to create new schemas have to reach out to IRMA and add it to their&nbsp;list.</p><p>IRMA uses such a centralized approach because it finds no immediate need to decentralize the creation of new schemas at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>Here’s how the Schema Manager looks like in&nbsp;IRMA</p> SchemeManager  +-- IssuerName  |   +-- Issues  |   |   +-- CredentialName  |   |       +--- description.xml  |   |       +--- logo.png  |   +-- PublicKeys  |   |   +-- 0.xml  |   |   +-- 1.xml  |   +-- PrivateKeys (need not be present)  |   |   +-- 0.xml  |   |   +-- 1.xml  |   +-- description.xml  |   +-- logo.png  +-- description.xml  +-- index  +-- index.sig  +-- pk.pem  +-- timestamp <p>As you can see, the schema creation process of each of these frameworks comes with its share of advantages and disadvantages, so there’s really no better one. Just depends on the implementation and developer preference.</p> Real-world Implementations <p>At the time of writing this piece, IRMA has three known implementations in the real&nbsp;world.</p>  Age verification in liquor stores in Almere, Netherlands  A consortium of e-health companies called nuts.nl that identify and authenticate users using&nbsp;IRMA  A work-in-progress (WIP) implementation to mitigate fake news using digital signatures.  <p>VCs, on the other hand, have many implementations.

 How tools of IP can help creators and collectors better protect their rights and&nbsp;monetize  Summary <p>This article aims to improve understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP), as a tool to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It gives a mini backgrounder on IP, then connects IP to ERC721 NFTs at Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p>Follow-up articles explore <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">ERC20</a>, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">ERC721+ERC20</a> for NFTs &amp;&nbsp;IP.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;Bitcoin” <p>Ownership of a hundred dollar bill is straightforward: “if you hold it, you own it”. Same for a physical painting. Ownership of real-world objects is defined through physical access control [0]. This has benefits: it’s a simple mental model, it protects the owner, and transfer of ownership is&nbsp;easy.</p><p>We’re half a century into the computer era. Yet it hasn’t been easy to translate ownership of physical assets to intangible assets like electronic money or digital art. As a workaround, the world has used human-readable contracts for these intangible assets. Alas, these “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">wet-code</a>” contracts are tedious to understand, expensive, slow, and error-prone. For example, “this 100-page document says you own it”&nbsp;😬.</p><p>Then along came Bitcoin, a “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">dry-code</a>” machine-readable approach to electronic money, with blockchain as the basis. Like real-world assets, ownership of digital assets is defined through access control. For Bitcoin this means “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinIsrael">Your keys, your Bitcoin</a>”. This gains the benefits of real world assets: simple mental model, protects the owner, and easy transfer of ownership. It’s cheaper, faster, and less error-prone than previous “wet-code” approaches to digital assets. Digital tools can track ownership of physical assets as&nbsp;well.</p> 1.2 IP as a Tool → “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;NFT” <p>Inspired by Bitcoin, in 2013 we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1376105737827594241">built</a> <a href="http://trent.st/content/2015-06-24%20ascribe%20whitepaper.pdf">ascribe</a> for “dry code” digital art and other creative works. ascribe leveraged Bitcoin blockchain. Our mantra was “<a href="https://medium.com/silicon-allee/art-and-tech-in-berlin-a-powerful-combination-c40e9b328f7">own digital art the way you own Bitcoin</a>.” Blockchain technology helped creators and collectors secure their work and monetize.</p><p>Early on in ascribe, we discovered that Intellectual Property (IP) was an incredibly useful toolbox to help creators and collectors protect their rights and earn a living. The language and laws of IP go back literally centuries. All the books you’ve read, music you’ve heard, and movies you’ve watched have IP language backed up by laws to protect the authors, musicians and filmmakers.</p><p>So for ascribe, we used the language of IP to make the rights for creators &amp; collectors maximally clear. It’s a powerful tool, and we leveraged it heavily. We also used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160606190958/https://www.ascribe.io/terms/">legal contracts</a> to help bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Whereas ascribe was an early IP * blockchain project, IP * blockchain has now evolved into full-fledged <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70">field</a>: NFTs. The mental model is all about access control: “your keys, your&nbsp;NFT.”</p><p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has been my focus for several years now. It’s about sharing, buying and selling data as an asset, by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">tokenizing digital access control</a>. Since data is IP, Ocean is about data IP assets. “Your keys, your data.” In Ocean, we also leverage the language of IP and, as a bonus, legal contracts to bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p> 1.4 Outline <p>We’ve realized that our experiences over the last eight years may be helpful to others in the NFT field. The aim of this post (and subsequent posts) is to help clarify. This post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Section 2 is an IP mini-backgrounder. In it, we introduce key terms from the language of IP — copyright, exclusive rights, licenses — along with a brief history and legal implementation.</p><p>Then in sections 3 and 4, we describe what the most popular NFTs standard — <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> — is doing from a framing of IP language, and how to leverage IP law for further protection.</p>  We do this for two specific cases: single-edition ERC721 (section 3) and limited-edition ERC721 (section&nbsp;4).  For each section, we first describe definitions — how “publish”, “sub-license”, “base IP”, “sub-licensee” etc is modeled in smart contracts and license terms. Then we provide a sequence diagram to illustrate the actions, followed by a structure diagram to show system state after each action. It’s fairly technical — we found this necessary in order to have enough clarity, all with the goal of protecting rights of creators and collectors.   2. IP Mini-Backgrounder <p>This section is a mini-backgrounder on intellectual property (IP), which is all about property of the intellectual variety.</p><p>IP and Copyright Law. Rights on digital art, physical art, music, books, and data all fall under IP law, specifically copyright law [1]. The<a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/summary_berne.html"> Berne Convention</a> of<a href="https://www.wipo.int/"> WIPO</a> was signed by<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> 179 countries</a> including USA and Germany. Each country enacts its own laws according to its guidelines.</p><p>Copyright. The Convention provides creators “with the means to control how their work is used, by whom, and on what terms”. In it, the “creator of a work<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> doesn’t need to apply</a> for copyright, or to register it.” Rather, copyright automatically exists once it has been put it into “a fixed form”, e.g. as a recording on audio tape or as magnetic bits on a hard disk. However the Convention does suggest registration, to help prove that you’re the creator of the work in the event of&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Exclusive Rights. If a publishing house “buys the rights” to an author’s work, they typically get an exclusive license (a contract) to use that work for their own profit. The base IP goes from the author to the publishing house. If a music label “buys the rights” to a musician’s work, the base IP goes from the musician to the label. And so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>Sub-licenses. When you buy an e-book, you’re buying the license to read it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell 1000 copies, since your contract doesn’t include those rights. When you buy a song from iTunes, you’re buying the license to listen to it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell it or play it on the radio, since you don’t have the license for&nbsp;that.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical. It describes what <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> code is doing from an IP perspective. We start with single-edition NFTs.</p> 2. Single-Edition ERC721 code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions <p>This section describes how IP legals get implemented in Single-Edition ERC721 [3]. The two main actions are to publish and to sub-license. They’re defined, and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, i.e. copyright or initial exclusive license. This is implemented as ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self&nbsp;. To implement legals, metadata points to a T&amp;C stating that _safeMint() is a claim of base&nbsp;IP.  To Sub-license means transfer exclusive license to new exclusive licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom(). To implement legals, the T&amp;C states that safeTransferFrom() is a sub-licensing action that grants specific&nbsp;rights.  <p>Base IP, Base IP Holder, and Licensee are defined and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Base IP means the artifact being copyrighted. Represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder means the holder of the Base IP. Represented as the the actor that did the initial “publish” action.  Sub-licensee is the holder of the sub-license. Represented as the entity that controls address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x].   2.2 Single-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example with focus on behavior. The corresponding image is below. We use a UML sequence diagram. Each arrow indicates a Solidity method call to the ERC721 contract. The origin of the arrow is the entity who initiated the call, such as publisher or licensee1. The arrows do not show value transfer, e.g. from publisher to licensee1. The UML structure diagram farther below helps to build intuition on the result of each method&nbsp;call.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls the deployed ERC721 contract’s _safeMint() method, keeping ownership to themselves (to=addressP). An ERC721 contract can hold many NFTs; therefore the publisher must specify which one (tokenId=7). The ERC721’s _owner attribute (a mapping) at tokenId=7 gets updated to addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Publisher to Licensee1. The publisher calls ERC721.safeTransferFrom() to send the NFT to Licensee1 (to=address1). The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❸ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Licensee1 to Licensee2. The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 Single-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The corresponding image is below. It roughly follows the format of a UML Composite Structure Diagram&nbsp;.It focuses on which actor has which IP rights, i.e. who owns&nbsp;what.</p><p>After Step ❶ (Publish), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT hasn’t been transferred yet, then the entity at this address can be interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❷ (exclusive Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now set to address1. The address1 owner is the exclusive licensee. Since the license is exclusive, this entity is also the Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❸ is like ❷, except now the address2 owner is exclusive licensee and Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Structure Diagram 3. Limited-Edition ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  3.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition NFTs means there are several NFT tokens for the same base IP [4]. Each token is its own&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Each edition may be considered fungible or non-fungible:</p>  Fungible if the edition can be swapped with another edition and no one cares. For example, a digital visual artwork in a gif has 10 limited editions available and there are no serial numbers. Or an e-book novel with 1000 limited editions.  Non-fungible if a swap does matter. For example, the NFT has a history of ownership or usage (provenance) that influences the price. Or collectors assign higher value to a particular edition number (“edition 3 is more valuable than edition&nbsp;17”).  <p>Here’s the implementation using ERC721. It would be fairly similar if using <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>; for ease of reading we will focus on&nbsp;ERC721.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. This is implemented as one ERC721._safeMint() call for each edition. Each call has a unique tokenId input. The IP claim is being made a separate time for each call; this works assuming one address does all initial&nbsp;minting.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom().  Base IP: represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: whoever performed the initial publish&nbsp;actions.  Sub-licensee: the owner of address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x,y,z] (example of 3 editions).   3.2 Limited-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls _safeMint() method three separate times, specifying tokenId=7, 8, and 9 for each&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7, from Publisher to Licensee1. The limited edition for tokenId=7 is sub-licensed to Licensee1 (address1). This method call is a non-exclusive sub-license; compare to an exclusive sub-license for the same call in the single-edition ERC721&nbsp;case.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7 from Licensee1 to Licensee2.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=8.</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 3.3 Limited-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners at tokenId=7, 8, and 9 are set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now address1, meaning the address1 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP). There isn’t an explicit way to do an exclusive sub-license of the base IP. This has a different interpretation than single-edition ERC721, where the same method call means an exclusive sub-licensing of the Base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then the address2 owner is sub-sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7, and the address3 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=8. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP).</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 4. Conclusion <p>This article aimed to improve understanding of Intellectual Property (IP), as a tool to help creators and collectors.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Google has launched <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai" title="Vertex AI">Vertex AI</a>, its fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform for the enterprise. It tackles the challenge of operationalizing AI/ML projects with automated pipelines, accessibility for business users, data scientists, and ML engineers, and pre-trained APIs for speech, vision, video, and more. The divide between technical know-how and precise customization and implementation of ML models is shrinking rapidly, thanks to AI Service Clouds.</p>
 Fully Managed will be a Distinguishing Feature 
<p>Fully managed will become a distinguishing feature of AI Service Clouds. Although attention is primarily given to the AI capabilities of AI Service Clouds, such as plug-and-play language, cognitive, and prediction capabilities, the implementation of these is simplified with managed services. For a wide variety of personas to collaborate on an AI project, a few things have to be in place: a user interface that abstracts away complexity from reliable AutoML that assists in data preparation, model selection, feature engineering, testing, validating, and beyond. The computational effort to power AutoML for model development, let alone implementation, is accessed most realistically from the cloud. The requirements are many: data storage of training and operational data, flexible training requirements like distributed, spot, or batch, model versioning, and much more. AI Service Clouds that are managed services abstract away the complexity of running AI/ML projects and hand off managing the computation-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>AI Service Clouds is an emerging market space, with much emphasis on AutoML, automated pipelines, pre-build models accessible via API, and making AI/ML accessible to business users without formal training in the field. But the computational effort that is required to make MLOps appear so effortless remains a fundamental part of this new wave of enterprise AI.</p>
<p></p>
 Our Recommendations 
<p>Be aware of your data: Your data has gravity, and whether intentional or not, the place where your data resides has an influence on the vendors and services you use. Especially in the AI/ML field which is so data-reliant, be strategic about planning where and how data is stored <a></a>so that it can serve your use cases in the best way possible. Security and privacy controls of your ML data should be considered on-prem and especially in the cloud. Google Cloud Vertex AI does provide additional security measures for sensitive data, such as encryption and dataset aggregation and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Be aware of your use cases: It’s okay to dream big when it comes to AI/ML, but don’t let the dream steer strategy. Always consider what the business needs are, then consider which technologies or revised processes could serve it. Don’t pursue AI for its own sake.</p>
<p>Be aware of who your AI/ML project impacts: If there is any time to implement multi-stakeholder practices, it is with your AI/ML projects. You will need a diverse development team to ask the right questions: How was the data that we use for training collected? Is it representative of your customers, or does it identify or alienate any group? Does the data adequately meet the needs of the business case? What communication strategies with end users are in place?</p>
<p>By automating and abstracting away complexity, AI Service Clouds make diverse teams more feasible, offer ready-made MLOps tools to the enterprise, and bring flexibility to the computation question. Read the Market Compass: AI Service Clouds to learn more.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce Anonyome Labs is listed in the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs joins&nbsp;355&nbsp;other&nbsp;qualified organizations in&nbsp;the&nbsp;2021&nbsp;compendium of&nbsp;privacy tech vendors. This is a significant increase from the 44 vendors listed in the inaugural report in 2017.&nbsp;The number of&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories&nbsp;is also higher in 2021: now 11 categories split across two groups&nbsp;—&nbsp;Privacy program management and&nbsp;Enterprise privacy management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this growth in both vendor numbers and&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories as evidence of the explosion in market awareness of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;of&nbsp;the vital need to protect&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;among consumers and enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP agrees, saying these changes represent as a “metamorphosis” in the privacy landscape in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the IAPP released its 2017 report, it described the privacy technology marketplace as being “on the precipice of a major evolutionary shift”. You’ll recall the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;was about a year off becoming law and the marketplace had some early tech vendors.&nbsp;(<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;was around at this time—we were established in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">2014</a>&nbsp;through the pioneering foresight of our early founders—but&nbsp;we&nbsp;were still developing our early products.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2017,&nbsp;the world has&nbsp;seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California Consumer Privacy Act&nbsp;2018</a>, Brazil’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-vs-lgpd/">General Data Protection Law2018</a>, and other privacy laws around the world, including plenty of&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;movement at the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state level in the US</a>.&nbsp;This raft of&nbsp;new&nbsp;compliance requirements has brought&nbsp;a corresponding increase in the demand for privacy tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, the rise of privacy&nbsp;tech was the focus of an expert panel at this year’s Data Privacy Day. Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">8 Key Takeaways From the ‘Rise of Privacy Tech’ Panel With Our Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;for some considered insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In releasing the&nbsp;5th&nbsp;edition of the&nbsp;Privacy Tech Vendor Report&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;the IAPP&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">observes</a>: “Privacy tech has undergone a paradigm shift over the past five years, affecting everything from the development of&nbsp;privacy tech tools to the attitude toward privacy tech vendors. The five-year mark of the report’s existence is perhaps the proper time to look at how far the privacy tech market has gone and where it will go in the future”.&nbsp;(We’ve been thinking about the future of privacy for a while. Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">10-year forecast</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 2021 report, Anonyome Labs is listed under the Privacy Information Managers category&nbsp;as the best fit, but we acknowledge that our enterprise offering,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, is difficult to categorize given its unique depth and breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;is&nbsp;a scalable developer platform that provides companies with the necessary tools to build privacy and&nbsp;cybersafety&nbsp;solutions into new and existing products for their end users. The&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform’s public APIs and SDKs offer developers various privacy-oriented capabilities including private telephony and email services, end-to-end encrypted communications, private browsing, password management, virtual card payments. These capabilities are available for mobile, desktop, and web applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Inside&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>At the heart of&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform is our&nbsp;innovative digital identity concept called the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo</a>. A Sudo is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile and manage it.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos are the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;of our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a> complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">MySudo</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions, they can use the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">menu of high value privacy tools</a> delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>When giving the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a> Annual Informatics Lecture, our co-CEO and CTO, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, spoke on <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and the tech driving it this <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>, particularly identity and anonymous profiles online. Paul shared that in developing the&nbsp;Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before. And that’s what the global fight for privacy will demand from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages with user data: out of the box thinking and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the Internet was born in 1983, computer networks lacked a standard method of communicating with one another. In the years since — as online communications have grown interwoven with our daily lives and revolutionised the world we live in — there remains a crucial thing we still don’t have a standardised way of talking about in the digital world: you.</p>



<p>Without a standardised way of identifying people online, websites began to use local accounts with usernames and passwords. You likely have several of these that you rely on in your daily life: your Amazon account, your email account, your Netflix account. These sites also began storing usage information, personal data and data about the user obtained through 3rd party sources in the user account. This approach created&nbsp; so-called siloed identities.</p>



<p>As the internet has grown to encompass everything from your private inbox to your grocery orders, your workout regimen and your finances, your personal data is now collected and stored in dozens of places outside your control. You — the digital you that is — are a string of accounts where third parties hold your information on their servers.</p>



<p>This creates big problems. Your data resides in silos that are potentially vulnerable to hackers, data leakage and other privacy breaches. Just ask the 338 million customers of Marriott Hotels whose personal information, including passport numbers, were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54748843">leaked</a> between 2014 and 2018. In 2020 alone, the number of personal records <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/#download">compromised</a> in data breaches grew 141 percent to 38 billion, according to security firm Risk Based Security (RSB). The other problem is that the usage of this data, even if it is secure, cannot be controlled — the user even doesn’t know what is stored where and has no direct access. Not to mention that this approach requires a separate account for every service you use, leaving you with dozens or even hundreds of passwords and logins (remember, you should never reuse a password!), multiplying the spread of your personal data across the internet and contributing to a less-than-satisfactory user experience. What’s more, this situation leaves internet users vulnerable to phishing and other scams that trick people into giving away their personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of&nbsp; internet giants like Google and Facebook came the idea of federated identity. That’s when third parties allow you to log in to their site or app using, for example, your Gmail account. If you go to a website and use the “sign in with” functionality, known as “single sign-on”, you’re using a federated identity — Google or Facebook are playing the role of identity provider.&nbsp; In such a setup, the multi-account problem may have been solved, but new, serious problems arise. The companies that dominate the federated identity space, basically acting as middlemen for your digital existence, have huge economic incentive to collect as much data about your online interactions as possible — and mine it for profit. Google, for example, has been accused of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49593830">secretly tracking</a> its own users in Europe, and was fined for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html">illegally harvesting data</a> from children in the US. A less obvious issue is that the providers of single sign-on services also have control over where you are allowed to use your identity and can potentially deny its usage according to their will, be it economic interest, opaque&nbsp; ethical principles or governmental pressure. Twitter can ban you forever, Instagram can close your account, Facebook can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/facebooks-australian-news-wipeout-showed-it-can-delete-our-history-at-any-time">wipe your page</a>. You could say that they control your digital existence.</p>



<p>Thankfully, a better way is emerging. It’s a third kind of online identity where your personal data is neither strewn across an inefficient patchwork of silos nor controlled by a big company that mines your personal data for money.</p>



<p>It’s called self-sovereign identity (SSI).</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is the next major step in the evolution of digital identity. It closes the gap on inefficiencies and privacy concerns around the ways you make yourself known online by putting you in control.</p>



<p>First, here’s the theory behind it.</p>



<p>Basically, SSI means a person, or an organisation, completely owns, controls and manages their identity online. You are your own identity provider — there is no one else who can claim to “provide” your identity for you because it’s intrinsically yours.</p>



<p>In a more formal way we can say that SSI follows 10 key principles, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">as first outlined by Christopher Allen</a>:</p>



  SSI provides an independent existence and absolute control for its users, who hold the access to their own data. That means no intermediaries owning or sifting through your data: it belongs to you.  SSI is transparent (so that you can understand any system or algorithm involved), interoperable (so it integrates well with other systems) and portable (meaning no vendor or device lock-in).&nbsp;  SSI offers persistence (the identities will last for as long as you want them to last… no need to worry about Facebook deleting your Instagram account) and protection (erring always on the side of protecting individuals’ freedoms and rights).&nbsp;  SSI prioritises consent (users must always agree to how their identity is being used — whether that’s to disclose or restrict data) and minimisation (you should only disclose the data that you need to, supporting privacy as much as you can.)&nbsp;  



<p>To this practical list, <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> adds an 11th principle of our own:</p>



  SSI values usability — it’s&nbsp; easy to use, adopt and understand. There are no complex bells and whistles, just the means to share and use the information you want, when you want, and it’s easy to carry around with you.  







<p>From the user perspective, practical SSI looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the user, you possess a digital identity wallet which stores the data related to your identity and interacts with other SSI-enabled systems. The wallet can be in the form of an app on your mobile phone or a web-based service or, often, a combination of both.</p>



<p>Your personal data is stored in the wallet in the form of verifiable credentials, rather than on centralised servers. It’s kept under the user’s sovereign control and literally in the user’s possession. A verifiable credential itself is a representation of data which is cryptographically tamper-proof and traceable to its origin (more on that later).</p>



<p>What sort of personal data can be stored in the identity wallet? Any statement about you that can be represented digitally! This could include digital representations of personal ID cards, education diplomas, login credentials, property deeds, corporate badges, vaccination passports, COVID-19 test results, any transaction records and much, much more. Using the wallet, you can selectively present some of these credentials to an interested third party, either some of the time or all of the time. You can record your consent to share data with others, and easily facilitate that sharing. Your data is persistent and not reliant on any single third party to be stored or forwarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we have the basic components, let’s look at the interactions they enable. In the below diagram, we have a mental model for how identity can be managed in a way that delivers on the SSI principles. It is known as the SSI Trust Triangle.</p>







<p>Let’s walk through this diagram step by step.</p>



<p>An issuer makes claims or assertions about a user. These claims are bundled together into verifiable credentials and given to the user, who stores them in their digital wallet. From there, they can decide which verifiers they want to present these credentials to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the issuer in this case is a university. The assertion they want to make about you is that you’re a graduate and that you have an MBA. So they issue a verifiable credential that you can store in your identity wallet. Now, let’s say you’re applying for a job at a financial agency. As part of your application, you’re able to prove that you have an MBA by making your credential visible to the company you’re applying to. Note that the verifier — in this case the prospective employer — does not need to contact the university to confirm the authenticity of the diploma credential. Conversely, neither the university, nor anyone else, will know which companies you are applying to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many real-world business interactions involve a similar flow of data.</p>



<p>Need a fishing license? Rather than go to a government office, with SSI you could apply using a digital driver’s license. Want to sign up for an industry conference? Use a digital work ID issued by your employer. Want to rent a flat? Confirm your ID, your proof of solvency and your employment status to your new landlord by presenting the relevant credentials in your wallet.</p>



<p>If you were looking carefully at the diagram you might have noticed that it also has “blockchain” in it — we haven’t mentioned that yet! Read on to learn the role distributed ledger technologies play in SSI and why they work so well together.</p>



 What’s the Technology Behind SSI? 



<p>SSI relies on modern cryptography and decentralisation to make the things described above work.</p>



<p>The core idea is to give users free, unique, machine-readable, user-controlled, persistent and anonymous identifiers that are decoupled from the “personal data” about the user they “identify”. These are called decentralised identifiers, or DIDs. This might sound intimidatingly jargonistic, but the idea of identifiers is of course not new — email addresses, phone numbers, profile IDs and all sorts of other sensitive numbers have a long tradition of being (mis-)used for such purposes. The difference is that they are neither free, persistent, anonymous nor user-controlled.</p>



<p>DIDs can not only be generated&nbsp; for people, but also for organisations, objects, digital documents and more. Every participant in the SSI ecosystem needs at least one, but you can also have more than one DID in the same way that you might have one email address for work and one for personal use. Each DID is cryptographically linked to a secret key that only the DID owner knows, along with a corresponding public key that other users can use to verify claims made by the DID owner. Aside from this, DIDs are anonymous: they don’t contain or reveal any information about their owner.</p>



<p>The blockchain is used to perpetuate this linkage in a way that guarantees that the data associated to the link can be changed by the owner of the DID, cannot be maliciously manipulated and persists forever. (NB: this is of course based on the assumption that a decentralised structure with many autonomous nodes will not go down, as a one single company could. There are also SSI architectures that work without&nbsp; distributed ledgers.)</p>



<p>The second pillar of SSI is the concept of verifiable credentials, or VCs, which can be thought of as a “file format” for storing the claims about an entity which guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the data. They also come with useful features like selective disclosure of claims, Zero Knowledge Proofs, and semantic overlays that do not have analogue alternatives. For now, though, all you need to remember is that a VC contains real-world relatable data about a thing or person — the credential subject — and that it is linked to the DIDs of the issuer and the subject and is tamper-proof.</p>



<p>The main function of your identity wallet is to manage the user’s private keys, store VCs about the user securely and enable safe communication with other identity wallets, in order to exchange VCs and data derived from them in a way that protects your privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you need to disclose information to a third party, your wallet will let you pick the relevant data attributes from different credentials and combine them with the DIDs of the corresponding issuers, as well as your own DID and a cryptographic signature. This is called a verifiable presentation (VP). From here, the VP can be transferred to the verifier, who, based on the cryptographic signature in the VP, is able to independently verify two things:</p>



  The data contained in the issuer’s claims have not been changed, and  the person who presented the VP is the same person about whom the issuer originally made the claim.  



<p>Of course, this is just an overview and does not cover important aspects such as security, revocation of credentials and governance structure. In the meantime, the <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi Labs</a> and the SSI community continue to explore and develop these topics. Expect blog posts on them soon!&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Your Identity 



<p>It won’t happen overnight, but the move away from conventional siloed and federated identities is already underway, giving people more control over their lives as well as more convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, SSI projects exist that:</p>



  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-refugee-funds-idUSKCN1T1025">Help refugees</a> prove their identities and credentials in their new homeland.  Onboard <a href="https://www.evernym.com/onfido-deloitte/">new customers</a> at major financial institutions.  Allow you to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/iata-travel-pass/index.html">present Covid-19 tests and vaccination records</a> when you travel.  



<p>The possibilities for the technology are virtually endless. Policymakers see this, too: The European Union is developing its own European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), and has invested in companies developing SSI projects and platforms.</p>



<p>The benefits of&nbsp; adopting SSI are also clear: increased privacy, fewer data breaches, and more efficient administration of business and government, which helps in the process of wealth creation. At this point, it’s no longer a matter of if, but when.&nbsp;</p>

 Key insights about scaffolding mental wealth and humane development in the 21st&nbsp;century Drivers of mental health and wellbeing and the investment classes required to build mental&nbsp;wealth<blockquote>This is the second in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #2 is a preview of our international portfolio around mental wealth in Sweden, Dubai, England and South Korea as well as some of the learnings that are coming out of it, externally and internally.</blockquote>Screenshot from the last DM Download on mental&nbsp;wealth What is mental&nbsp;wealth? <p>Remaking our institutional, environmental and cultural contexts will be essential to the development of people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities. In a time of complexity and uncertainty, these capacities provide foundational infrastructure for our 21st- and 22nd-century society and economy. We call this societal scale intangible infrastructure — Mental Wealth and scaffolding this will be of the highest priority during our nascent rebuilding phase after COVID-19.</p><p>However, already four years ago Dark Matter Labs started exploring Mental Wealth’s relations to our build environment, our ways of learning, the technological advancement, society’s changing demographics, the development of our ecological systems and how our deep codes (financing, contracting, policy making, regulating, governing) impact these. Below we share a summary and key insights of various streams of work on the ground and we invite you to join the continued conversation and exploration.</p> Invisible Landscapes: <br>We Are&nbsp;They <p>We Are They was an exhibition by DML as part of the Invisible Landscapes series at the RA in 2018. The animation is based around the idea of the built environment as an infrastructure for health and wellbeing, and tries to outline how technology is allowing us to both understand and quantify the effects of the modern city, as well as how we might democratize the power to analyse and update&nbsp;it.</p> Logic Model of ‘Viable* conditions into thriving&nbsp;society” <p>*viability: ability to work as intended or to succeed/ability to continue to exist or develop as a living&nbsp;being</p><p>Our shared timeline to become aware of and act for our planetary future is limited and we realise the need for a radically different thesis in order to unlock our current lock-ins*. Our current version of the world has systems optimised for minimum viability for the whole and maximum viability for the few. For instance, The average income of the top 10% in Sweden, was 6.3 times higher than that of the bottom 10%.* In an age of complexity and uncertainty we recognise the need for a multi-dimensional and multi-actor transition that sees the unprecedented opportunity to create a hyper-viable world. The fundamentals of this transition will be rooted in the way we realise and recalibrate the values on which our ecosystem of relationships is based on. Humane relationships that rely on trust and our sense-making ability to separate signals from noise. In this sense, Viable Cities and Dark Matter Labs have developed the logic models of hyper viability to understand multi dimensional conditions of humane thriving and viable&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Logic model:</p><p>We often use a logic model to understand complex relationships between resources, activities and impacts and to comprehend the underlying logic behind visible data. In other words, the logic model tends to fail (despite its usefulness), because there are always gaps in details &amp; interrelational logics. The logic model of ‘hyper viability’ had various iterations:</p>  The 1st logic model identified three key economies: technology, health and natural systems at the centre of transitions towards a thriving society. There are differences between dimensions of time and speed in each&nbsp;economy.  The 2nd logic model explored key trends and drivers influencing economies impacting humane thriving.  The 3rd logic model discovered that transitions require tapping into multiple layers of the system by understanding new forms of relationships — to self, others, nature and the future, instead of putting humane development as the ultimate aim of a thriving&nbsp;society.  The 4th logic model proposed that the transition towards a viable thriving society requires a thriving life for all within planetary boundaries. This requires a fundamental shift in the way we understand and make sense of our interconnected ecosystem, ranging from our relationships, culture, institutions, psychology/sociology and environment to technology.  <p>In order to collectively move towards a thriving society, we need to understand what kinds of transition capacities and capabilities we need to build. The 5th version of the viability logic model is in the making, which emphasises the need to enable our shared sensemaking, innovation and democratic fitness capacity and capabilities towards transition, alongside an investment into our underlying human development contexts.</p> Mind//Shift: <br>Towards a 21st Century Caring&nbsp;Economy <p>Our 21st century will require us to look at mental health and wellbeing beyond treatment, to systemically embrace prevention and most importantly enable thriving. In 2019 Dark Matter Labs joined the creation of <a href="http://www.mindshift.health/">MIND//SHIFT</a> to better understand and drive deep code experimentation that address Sweden’s most important intangible infrastructure for long-term sustainable development — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">Mental Wealth</a>. For advanced knowledge economies where high levels of cognitive, emotional and social functioning are a key advantage, looking after this infrastructure is critical to ensure that people can be creative, productive and imaginative in a rapidly changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>But how do we work towards rebuilding people’s cognitive, emotional, and social functioning when COVID-19 has triggered increases in <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">depression rates</a>, <a href="https://ki.se/en/nasp/the-coronavirus-risk-for-increased-suicide-and-self-harm-in-the-society-after-the-pandemic">suicides</a>, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic?gclid=CjwKCAiAsaOBBhA4EiwAo0_AnHQc3UlX2TiO7ktE0pmu8edO0KPJwPrfz-jkreF1WkGz37JRJnPkKxoCbJcQAvD_BwE">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/government-society-unemployment-covid19/">unemployment</a>? How do we rebuild public good and the ability to imagine another future when hope seem lost? These are the challenges we are facing as we embark on a year of experimenting and campaigning together with the our partners at MIND//SHIFT.</p>Ecosystem for local experimentation RewirEd: <br>Rethinking Education Models and Learning Environments <p>The project involves partners based in Dubai, but the reach (i.e. experimentation) will involve multiple countries. <a href="https://rewired2021.com/">RewirEd</a> stands for “Rewiring education for a prosperous and sustainable future” and we have been developing this global platform for education with our team in Dubai — <a href="https://radicle.studio/">Radicle</a>. In the past year, we have engaged with various stakeholders in education (and beyond) to develop a <a href="https://rewired.kumu.io/rewiring-nodes-in-the-education-system">system map</a> charting the interconnected issues in education and human development. Drawing on these insights, we have begun to develop a set of provocations that would serve as both an anchor and trigger for collective action towards education systems&nbsp;change.</p>On the left: Rewired System Map, In the middle: Rewired Provocation &amp; Experiments, On the right: Rewired Provocations &amp; Experiments v.2<p>There are 6 provocation areas relating to: sustainability, well-being, lifelong learning, ‘humane’ education, coalition building and education financing. The first four areas prompt us to imagine — if we put the human being at the centre, and ask what kind of conditions and support do we need in order for humans (and other beings) to collectively thrive — they would revolve&nbsp;around:</p><p>1. Learning with Nature: building more capacity for consciousness and action on issues of sustainability, as well as incorporating wisdom from indigenous communities and orienting schools towards principles of circular&nbsp;economy</p><p>2. Well-being in Education: measuring mental, physical, emotional health and making them a part of critical school outcomes and community objectives</p><p>3. Learning Beyond School: creating new incentives and infrastructures for lifelong learning and learning beyond the boundaries of the school — such as in communities and&nbsp;cities</p><p>4. Humane Education: nurturing humane values and capacities such as relational intelligence, creativity, empathy, storytelling and sensemaking</p><p>The last two areas are centred on the how — “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?”</p><p>5. Collaboration for Impact: representing the need for cross-sector coalitions, innovation partnerships, and mechanisms to ensure collective commitment.</p><p>6. Novel Financial Infrastructures: creating new incentive mechanisms, innovative funding modalities, and decision-making apparatuses that can allow actors in the system to pursue radical transformations.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.dubaicares.ae/">Dubai Cares</a>, <a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/">Expo 2020&nbsp;Dubai</a></p> Key insights   Provocations must address both the what and the how. Many of our ideas are centred on the what — proposing new learning models, focus &amp; content — however, it is equally important to address the question, “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?” because this capacity at the system level needs to be nurtured in order for change to&nbsp;happen.  Radical imagination requires a legitimate foundation. System mapping process engaging multiple stakeholders enables discovering, analysing, cross-validating the challenges together, and strengthens the credibility in the process. This foundation builds legitimacy and reinforces radical imagination.  Through conversations and research it has become clear that the taxonomy of mental health is largely associated with treatment, failure to treat and the clinical space of operation. This reality has structurally limited our capacity to systemically perceive and allocate resources to preventative initiatives and perhaps more critically thriving.  It is often said that we make what we measure. If this is the case, there is a risk that investment in mental wealth could be under-prioritised as a result of missing metrics. Without the metrics that look at mental wealth in a systemic way, we lack the data to build a case. More importantly, we are deprived of the ability to account for, drive, and value the co-beneficial results and spillover effects of a mental wealth portfolio.  Building the human capacity to collaborate horizontally is central to building mental wealth, at the same time as it is dependent on our mental wealth. Without developing people’s social and emotional capacity, it becomes difficult to unlock complex collaboration. It is necessary, therefore, to design capacity-building processes that incorporate social and emotional training. Without it, we will struggle to implement co-beneficial solutions where the human is no longer optimised to be a ‘bad robot’ but, rather, a highly cognitive, emotional, and social&nbsp;being.   From the Inside Out: <br>Our Internal approach to Human Development and Wellbeing <p>We are in the process of exploring what mental wealth means for us as an organisation and how that can be realised and nurtured in our context of increased uncertainty and psychologically demanding work. We are hoping to share a blog post with our take aways and learning towards the end of the&nbsp;year.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1 here</a>, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

What crypto means for the future of the monetary&nbsp;system <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard</a>:</p><blockquote>“I do believe that in the context where we maintain the role of safe central bank money as a foundation for the payment system, there’s a lot of room for competition and innovation to flourish,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“I think in a world where consumers and businesses retain access to a form of safe central bank money as part of that digital ecosystem, in fact we would see greater competition,” she said. “And that’s a good thing, it would be good to see a more dynamic, more innovative payment system foundation, a safe foundation that could provide greater opportunity for private sector participants to innovate.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF division chief Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’m not saying this is the case for the U.S. dollar,” explained Mancini, whose full title is division chief of IMF monetary and capital markets payments and infrastructure team. “This is a theoretical argument that underpins the greater stability of the world with multiple reserve currencies. So I think from an international perspective, that there’ll be more than one is a welcomed proposition,” Mancini said. He added that the world already has multiple reserve currencies including the dollar, the euro and the Japanese&nbsp;yen.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“For crypto assets to be a significant risk to central banks, there needs to be a considerable amount of currency substitution,” Mancini said, which in this context means countries would have to use a (theoretically) more stable cryptocurrency instead or in addition to the local currency.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Fed’s Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-cbdc-economic-retaliation-consensus-2021">CBDC May Give China ‘Leeway for Economic Retaliation’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF Official: ‘A World With More Than One Reserve Currency Is a More Stable World’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-brian-brooks-digital-dollar">Brian Brooks: Digital Dollar ‘More a Discussion Than a Reality’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jared-polis-colorado-governor-consensus-2021">Gov.

Last month, [European Investment Bank], [Goldman Sachs] and [Société Générale] had to spend ether in order to issue a bond. Those entities needed ether for operating expenses. It’s happening right&nbsp;now.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">CMT Digital co-founder and CEO Colleen Sullivan</a> on why Chicago is becoming a DeFi&nbsp;hotspot:</p><blockquote>She puts the Chicago situation down to New York’s BitLicense, the state’s regulatory framework that debuted in 2015 and requires startups to obtain a license for cryptocurrency activities. It got 22 applications in its first round, while 15 companies closed down. Between 2015 and 2020, only 25 firms were approved. New York’s loss was Chicago’s gain and the result has turned the Illinois city into a hotbed of crypto collaboration.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">BlockFi CEO Zac Prince</a> on the appeal of&nbsp;yields:</p><blockquote>“If you try to explain how the blockchain works, or why bitcoin has value, or some of the other more complex and in-the-weeds topics to folks when they’re on their journey into the crypto ecosystem, they might struggle to wrap their heads around it,” he said. “Everybody knows what an interest rate is. And everybody knows that earning 8.6% on something is better than earning&nbsp;0.2%.”</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“The fact that everyone can participate in affecting what the interest rate will be in these markets is a very big thing because, traditionally, big interest-rate movements have been decided by the banking industry; for example, by a few people sitting down with a room in London,” said Kulechov.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-8-questions-ethereum-andrew-keys">Consensus 2021: 8 Questions for Ethereum’s Andrew Keys — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">DeFi Is Rising in Chicago — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">High-Yield Crypto Ecosystem Offers Alternative to Low Interest Rates — CoinDesk</a>   4.

Half of Top Shot’s users have paid for packs or in trades, and between 150,000 to 250,000 log in every&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>The sterling growth numbers come as the broader NFT market gradually cools down from the breakneck highs of early 2021. Top Shot was no exception: desirable moments of top National Basketball Association stars traded for hundreds of thousands of dollars during the peak NFT&nbsp;craze.</blockquote><blockquote>“The headlines are always, you know, ‘LeBron sells for $200,000 or $300,000,” Gharegozlou said, “but the reality is, out of the four and a half-ish million transactions on the marketplace in the past few months, over 3 million have been less than&nbsp;$50.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">Christie’s Noah&nbsp;Davis</a>:</p><blockquote>“This is the art world’s Napster, potentially, because it could be that disruptive to the way people do business,” said Noah Davis, Christie’s point person on NFTs, referring to the music-sharing service. The British auction house announced in February it would accept ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native currency, as a payment method, right before Beeple’s watershed digital artwork went under the hammer. The artwork was eventually sold for $69 million to Singapore-based blockchain entrepreneur MetaKovan, aka Vignesh Sundaresan.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot Has Crossed the Million-User Mark — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">NFTs Are ‘Art World’s Napster’: Christie’s Auction House Exec — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/gary-vaynerchuk-consensus-2021">Gary Vaynerchuk: The Next Mickey Mouse Could Be an NFT — CoinDesk</a>   5.

We need to rethink our frameworks for the&nbsp;internet <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cory-doctorow-web3-seize-means-of-computation">Cory Doctorow</a>:</p><blockquote>“We live in this world where bandits run amok wanting to do terrible things to you and your data,” the science fiction author, blogger and privacy advocate said Wednesday night at Consensus 2021. “But rather than defending yourself, you can ally yourself with a warlord like Apple or Google or Facebook or Salesforce.”</blockquote><blockquote>In this “feudal security model” (a phrase Doctorow attributed to cryptography legend Bruce Schneier), when the masses try to vote with their dollar or their click, as they would in a free market, they can’t escape the oligopoly power of tech&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>“Both implicit and explicit forms of collusion, combined with a monopoly rent by not having to compete, allows firms to really structure markets and create policies that advantage them,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-libra-diem-morgan-beller-consensus2021">Libra co-creator Morgen Beller</a> on why it probably won’t be Facebook:</p><blockquote>“I think I have some PTSD and regulatory scars,” Beller, who is now general partner at the venture fund NFX, said during a session at Consensus 2021, speaking alongside representatives of Visa, the Dash cryptocurrency and Terraform Labs.</blockquote><blockquote>Beller is credited as a co-creator of the Libra project, a cryptocurrency envisioned by the social network as a global payments rails.

 Introduction <p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol which enables data providers to securely sell their datasets by maintaining their data privacy (using our Compute-to-Data technology). Data consumers can discover and purchase datasets to train their AI algorithms on that&nbsp;data.</p><p>OCEAN is the reserve currency and utility token of Ocean Protocol. It has multiple utilities today and we are adding many more utilities. This article is a compilation of DeFi utilities of OCEAN, focused on staking and liquidity provision opportunities for OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>If you want to learn about OCEAN dynamics and value accrual, please refer to the post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean Token&nbsp;Model</a>.</p> OCEAN Utilities in&nbsp;DeFi  1. Staking / Liquidity Provision  Ocean Market <p>OCEAN holders can stake their OCEAN on datasets in <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and become stakers. By staking OCEAN, stakers receive guaranteed swap fees from subsequent staking, unstaking and data purchase activities that happen in their staked data pools. By staking on promising datasets, stakers also speculate on attractive future returns on their staked tokens. But needless to say, such staking opportunities comes with some risks. For more info on staking opportunities and risks in Ocean Market, check out <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">this blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p> POP! Town <p>OCEAN holders can provide their tokens as single-sided liquidity onto POP! Town’s <a href="https://new.pop.town/">Mutual Liquidity Pool (MLP) marketplace</a>. By participating in the MLP as a farmer, holders will receive rewards in 3 tokens: POP!, OCEAN, and ALBT. In addition, should users experience Impermanent Loss (IL), a portion of it will be mitigated through POP!’s unique Rebalancing Mechanism.</p>  LP Mining Rewards: APY &gt; ~100% at the time of&nbsp;writing.  Provide liquidity on POP! Town&nbsp;<a href="http://new.pop.town">here</a>.   Balancer   Swap Fees earned per transaction: Vary for different pools.  Provide Liquidity in one of the Balancer pools&nbsp;<a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore?token=0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">here</a>.   Uniswap V2   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.3%.  Provide Liquidity on Uniswap&nbsp;<a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">here</a>.   SushiSwap   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.25%.  Provide Liquidity on Sushiswap <a href="https://app.sushi.com/add/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48/ETH">here</a>.   ODollar/USDC   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.01%.  LP Mining Rewards: UMA (APY ~ &gt;60% dependent on price of UMA + total supply of ODollars)  Provide Liquidity on Balancer&nbsp;<a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x4e2579468f414f3b2c683e8562d4c67056d5cb4b/">here</a>.   Bancor   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.20% (can&nbsp;vary).  Pros — Provide single sided liquidity in OCEAN with 100% impermanent loss protection when staked for 100&nbsp;days.  Provide Liquidity on Bancor&nbsp;<a href="https://app.bancor.network/eth/portfolio/stake/add/single/0xCDfF066eDf8a770E9b6A7aE12F7CFD3DbA0011B5">here</a>.   2. Lend/Borrow  OpenDAO <p>OCEAN holders can borrow ODollars by locking their OCEAN at 0% interest in OpenDAO’s <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. These ODollars can then be swapped with USDC, which OCEAN holders can use however they&nbsp;want.</p>  OCEAN has to be locked into the contract to mint ODollars. Minimum collateral ratio is 1.25 but for safety against black swan events, OpenDAO platform applies collateral ratio of &gt;2. This means that even if OCEAN price decreases by 50% in a day or an hour etc., your OCEAN will be unlikely toreach liquidation point, and you could lock more OCEAN to increase your position or pay ODollars back to unlock your&nbsp;OCEAN.  Locked OCEAN can be unlocked anytime by locking the account by paying owed ODollars back into the <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. Those ODollars are burnt and taken out of circulation to ensure that each ODollar has sufficient value (OCEAN) backing&nbsp;them.  On March 31, 2022 theODollar contract will expire — meaning that anyone holding ODollars can unlock equivalent locked OCEAN (in dollar terms) by burning their ODollars.   C.R.E.A.M. Finance <p>OCEAN was listed on <a href="https://app.cream.finance/">C.R.E.A.M. Finance</a> recently. We are currently working on increasing OCEAN collateral factor on Cream Finance. Once done, OCEAN holders will be able to deposit their OCEAN and earn yields or can stake OCEAN as collateral and borrow against&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Today, OCEAN holders can actively participate in theDeFi ecosystem by:</p>  Staking, lending, and/or borrowing to earn attractive yields;  Providing liquidity to earn swap fees and LP mining&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Rest assured that we are actively working on bringing more utilities to OCEAN. We sincerely thank you for being an important part of the Ocean Ecosystem and a proud OCEAN&nbsp;holder.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">Where to Stake your OCEAN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated IT transformation in many ways. Lessons learned, among other things, is that IT software architecture must be highly flexible and scalable to handle the unforeseen tsunami waves of network traffic and flexible enough to address cyber-attacks in areas least expected or prepared, such as potential vulnerabilities in communication applications like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Trello. Organization's sudden imperative to shore up cybersecurity systems such as Access Management became strikingly apparent.</p>
 Zero Trust 
<p>During the covid-19 pandemic, the in-office workforce abruptly shifted to a work-at-home environment opening the door to many potential attack vectors. Physicians, too, used their personal computers and mobile devices to help care for patients as they did in the medical office remotely through Telemedicine tools. Medical staff needed to authenticate and gain authorization to access patient information in locations outside their typical work areas to provide security while preserving privacy. Taking a zero-trust approach became even more relevant using a zero-trust principle to always verify the user identity before providing access to any resource. Identity assurance begins with Identity proofing and further uses fraud detection capabilities. This industry requirement became apparent in the 2020 KuppingerCole Access Management Leadership Compass, which saw an uptick in the number of Access Management products providing some level of identity proofing and fraud detection features or indicated that those capabilities are on its near-term roadmap.</p>
<p></p>
 Access Intelligence is Stepping Up to Play a Larger Role 
<p>Beyond core Access Management functionality such as authentication, authorization, federation, audit reporting, and even areas of API security, the use of analytics and access intelligence is increasing. Intelligence gives the ability to make access decisions that can be acted upon based on the patterns and trends found through data analytics and other machine learning techniques.&nbsp; Access intelligence can be used to discover new applications or API endpoints introduced to the network, identify potential access risks, make recommendations on security posture improvements, and reduce fraud, as some examples. The level of access intelligence seen in the market today is being driven by its usefulness and has become a significant differentiator between cybersecurity product vendors.</p>
 Automation 
<p>The automation of everyday Access Management tasks is becoming a priority for many organizations. Intelligence can drive automation to reduce the workload of IT security and administrative inefficiency and human error sometimes experienced through the manual completion of Access Management tasks. Organizations use automation with the intent of making their operations leaner and achieve lower TCO. Access Management automation can be applied to tasks such as the management of user access, applying roles, or automated discovery of applications and APIs on the network and then applying the applicable access and compliance policies.</p>
 So, Where Does Access Management Go from Here? 
<p>Although the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to make some unanticipated changes in their cybersecurity services, Access Management must still provide core functionality. Still, it can enhance its effectiveness by utilizing analytics, intelligence, and automation through more innovative Access Management products and services.</p>
<p>To better understand the challenges of Access Management in this pandemic era and how it continues to evolve to meet recent business environment changes, KuppingerCole invites you to join the German Cyber Access Summit 2021 to hear from the experts and inform yourself on how to make the best decision possible for your organization.</p>

 Kong Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p>The Konnect control plane creates new APIs and policies and publishes them to the data plane running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

<p></p>

 Authorization Code Flow 

<p>The authorization code flow goes through the following steps:</p>

 
   First, a user tries to consume the API. 
   If the user doesn’t have a token injected, Kong redirects the user to Okta, the identity provider. 
   The user authenticates on Okta and is sent back to Kong with an authorization code token. 
   Kong validates the parameters and exchanges the authorization code token by calling Okta’s token endpoint. 
 

<p></p>

 Add Your Services and Routes to Konnect 

<p>In Konnect’s ServiceHub, I have a service created already. Follow along in our <a href="https://konghq.com/blog/getting-started-konnect">Getting Started with Konnect tutorial</a> to learn how to create a service and routes.</p>

<p>My service has two routes defined already. I used the first service in the previous Kong and Okta tutorial to show the client credentials flow. In this tutorial, I’ll use the second service to apply the OIDC plugin utilizing the authorization code flow.</p>

<p></p>

 Set Up the Okta Application 

<p>In Okta, I prepared an application to implement the authorization flow already. In the Kong authorization code application, we’re going to use the configured OIDC plugin in addition to the client ID and client secret.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The app has the authorization code option turned on and the signing redirect URI set with the route available in my data plane. That means the authorization code is accepted for this URI only.</p>

<p></p>

 Consume the Route Without a Policy 

<p>Any user is free to consume the route right now since there’s no policy to control it.</p>

<p></p>

 Apply the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Just like we did for the client credentials flow tutorial, let’s go back to the Konnect control plane to apply the OIDC plugin and then implement the authorization code flow.</p>

 
   
    <p>Set the Config.Client ID.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Enter the Config.Client Secret.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Add Okta’s Config.Issuer endpoint.</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

<p>Click Create to enable the OIDC plugin to the route.</p>

 Test the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>If we try to consume the route again, Kong redirects us to Okta’s user interface to present our credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once we have presented our correct credentials, Okta authenticates and redirects us back to the API gateway. At this time, we’ll consume the API because we got the identity token injected inside our request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then we go to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a> to check the token.</p>

 OceanDAO Roadmap Update — Mid-2021 <p>Towards Scaling Community Funding in&nbsp;OceanDAO</p><p>This article describes challenges identified in <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, and the chosen solutions which are being rolled out. Together, these solutions will help improve funding efficiency, scale OceanDAO, and build traction across the Ocean Ecosystem.</p> 1. Introduction to&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>OceanDAO is a community-curated grants DAO that funds community-proposed projects. OceanDAO is a key component of the Ocean system-level design, designed for near-term growth and long-term sustainability.</p><p>OceanDAO has two goals: maximize the amount funded, with the constraint that (on average) every project has positive return on investment (ROI). This in turn will help to drive the health of OCEAN and data consume volume — the main performance indicators of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>OceanDAO sub-components include: Funding Rounds where the protocol unlocks capital to fund community projects, Grant Categories that represent core organizational pillars, Fundamental Metrics that shape product development goals, and Voting on project proposals.The most important parts of OceanDAO are already decentralized and community driven: proposal of projects and curation of projects (voting). Over time we expect to decentralize the entire OceanDAO&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Not every project we fund will succeed; we actually expect many to fail. But some of those that succeed will achieve incredible performance, returning more in value than was originally granted. Funding these successful projects should in theory outperform all other initiatives and create a positive&nbsp;ROI.</p><p>Learning how to repeat success empowers the Ocean community to fund the right projects with confidence and impunity.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the status quo funding structure of OceanDAO and other Ocean community funding programs. Section 3 describes the challenges identified. Section 4 describes candidate tools to help address the challenges. Sections 5 and 6 describe the tools chosen, which collectively address the problems identified. Section 6 converts these into a plan for the near-term OceanDAO&nbsp;roadmap.</p> 2. Status Quo Funding Structure <p>For a more complete picture, let’s review the different funding structures within the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>OceanDAO was initially deployed with small(ish) fixed-size grants, and community-curated voting to fund projects to build, perform outreach, and add data in the Ocean Ecosystem.</p><p>The Shipyard funding program had slightly larger grants where the funding was curated by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Additionally, the Ocean Ambassadors represent a very engaged community of individuals in the Ocean ecosystem. This group creates content, runs interviews, moderates social channels, writes articles, organizes events, and provides support to OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO has the ability to scale efficiently because projects are vetted and funded by the community. Basic tools like forums, Discourse, and more advanced Web3 tools like Snapshot have allowed the Proposal and Funding process to be fully managed by the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p>However, Shipyard processes were developed with numerous manual steps to coordinate with proposers, while centralizing the decision and funding process to an internal team at Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF). This process does not scale well as many processes exhibit 1:1 relationships where the internal team must spend a lot of cycles to support each project, instead of achieving 1:N outcomes.</p><p>Finally, OPF has contracts with several teams to improve core Ocean products — we call these Product Contracts. These contracts typically come with a public announcement, though they could benefit from further transparency.</p><p>The aim of this review and design process was to identify challenges in OceanDAO, Shipyard and related processes to identify possible solutions, tools, and scale the organization.</p> 3. Challenges Identified <p>Below is a list of challenges identified across OceanDAO and other funding structures. Challenges identified have been a result of documenting discussions, community feedback, and internal failures to achieve certain&nbsp;goals.</p><p>OceanDAO Challenges</p>  Quantifying ROI is hard. It’s hard to measure ROI in practice, which makes it hard for voters to judge projects that are coming back for repeat&nbsp;funding.  Fixed grant amounts. It’s harder to have positive ROI with this model as there are projects that will take larger grants more than they would have otherwise asked for, while others will be granted less than they&nbsp;need.  Low voter turn-out relative to number of token holders. Ideally more of the OCEAN in the system is being used to vote — it’s a sign of engagement and helps decentralization.  Sybil on voting and proposals. Multiple proposals are made by the same people who vote for themselves. This is a side effect of lower voter turn-out, and is worse they are large OCEAN holders (whales).  Quarterly targets for OCEAN funded are becoming harder to meet; low proposal turn-out is a contributor  Some people are in &gt;1 teams in a given funding round, it can appear like double-dipping, and it’s harder to quantify&nbsp;ROI  Some teams have &gt;1 proposals in a given funding round, it can appear like double-dipping and it’s harder to quantify&nbsp;ROI  Most proposals and grants have been for the “Build Apps” track. While we think building Ocean apps is great, there’s been less funding going to other tracks (Core sw, Developer Outreach, data, OceanDAO)  We don’t have a mechanism to bias funding towards a given track, or even a more specific sub-track (e.g. “Core Software — Documentation”)  Poor visibility into how much OCEAN went into each track or sub-track  OceanDAO Copy. Current descriptions on the website, wiki, etc. can be hard for new users to navigate. It does not provide sufficient objective, or quantifiable criteria.  <p>Shipyard Challenges with regards to&nbsp;OceanDAO</p>  Poor visibility into how funds are allocated in Shipyard vs OceanDAO; and specific tracks in&nbsp;Shipyard  Shipyard grant process and tooling is more manual, centralized, and does not scale&nbsp;well.  Shipyard tools and processes are not laid out very&nbsp;clearly.  Shipyard promises the time of Ocean core team members to grantees. This scales poorly and uses precious time from the core team (debatable whether time is well&nbsp;spent).  OceanDAO and Shipyard have overlapping processes and challenges, but both require tooling and core team time to perform well, and hit their respective goals.  Worry of double dipping: a single team can receive grants from both OceanDAO and Shipyard. Our policy is “each proposal must have different scope”, but in practice this is hard to track&nbsp;well.  Shipyard Copy. Current descriptions can be hard for new users to navigate. It does not provide sufficient objective, or quantifiable criteria.  Redirection. Shipyard applicants that got turned away got redirected to OceanDAO (good) but with little context, or were not redirected at&nbsp;all  <p>Ambassador Challenges with regards to&nbsp;OceanDAO</p>  Ambassador incentives and OceanDAO. The current integration between OceanDAO goals and Ambassadors make it hard to reward/incentivize ambassadors and contributors for specific activities.  Ambassadors are funded by Shipyard via manual process while OceanDAO can achieve the same in an autonomous manner.  Ambassadors can help drive bottom-up initiatives in OceanDAO and top-down initiatives from Shipyard. We can improve their integration and fund more efficiently by bringing them into OceanDAO.   4. Candidate Tools <p>Over the years, and especially the last few months, we’ve analyzed many DAO architectures, methodologies, and tooling. During the lifetime of OceanDAO we’ve also received many great suggestions from the community. Here is a list of ideas as “candidate tools”. Note that we have not committed to all of these ideas; they are merely listed as ideas, and will continue to be expanded in the future. In a later section we describe the ones that we are rolling out in the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>DAO Product</p>  One-Page OceaDAO website — (Update Landing Page ) — Consideration of Shipyard&nbsp;sunset.  Optimize OceanDAO funnel — Improve conversion, etc using many well-known tools, including removing friction in proposing grants, voting, receiving grants, and reporting progress  DAO v0.2 — Identify No+Low Code solutions that can establish good processes and workflows to scale the pipeline.  Proposal Submission Channels — Add more wallets that can create proposals / automate who can submit proposals to Snapshot.  Better ROI tracking — So that voters can see how each grantee is doing against their ROI. There are many possible things here: improved table, better measure of ROI metric, more. Continually make this better, improve data and ROI discovery. This will take real effort over time, but it’s critical to the long-term success of a grants&nbsp;program.  Vote Results Report — Granular voting will generate many proposals, we need to be able to easily communicate results.  Public DAO Roadmap — Increase transparency and intuition of long term objectives so grant propers, voters, and the community can make better decisions. That includes this blog post&nbsp;:)  <p>Efficient Processes</p>  Retire Shipyard — “Variable Funding’’ can fund large $OCEAN (community-curated), Product Contracts too (core-team-curated), therefore Shipyard is redundant (and keeping it has many problems, see “Shipyard-related Challenges” challenges above). &amp; OceanDAO might be able to leverage Shipyard’s quantifiable ROI+ methodologies, while Shipyard might be able to leverage OceanDAO’s scalable, and more decentralized proposal+vote+funding model (eg what is salvageable?). Migrate shipyard pipeline to&nbsp;DAO.  Fund ambassadors via OceanDAO — “Variable Funding” (see below) allows smaller $OCEAN and we can reduce manual processes.  Treasury via Request — Reduce friction for grantees, helps administration by OceanDAO core team until it becomes more decentralized  Product Contracts — Increase transparency of internal direction, efforts, and $OCEAN&nbsp;funded.  <p>Incentivizing Engagement</p>  Retroactive airdrops to voters in past OceanDAO rounds. (Note: this is an idea, it is not to be taken as a commitment.)  Airdrops to voters in future OceanDAO rounds. (Note: this is an idea, it is not to be taken as a commitment.)  Data Farming % boost weight for LPs who participated in the most recent Snapshot&nbsp;vote  Incorporate time incentive for *voters*, looking forward and/or backward in time. 1 year time frame. Eg vote weight is proportional to time staked forward, and time held backward, up to 1&nbsp;year.  <p>Incentivizing Volume &amp;&nbsp;Quality</p>  $OCEAN not granted is burned — This provides a stronger incentive to down-signal poor proposals, because it helps drive $OCEAN up (in line with Ocean token design). Eg Any project with e.g. &lt; 50% “+” votes will not be granted $OCEAN. In turn, this might encourage participation, as $OCEAN holders see the opportunity to signal more strongly on behalf of&nbsp;$OCEAN.  Align incentives for grant winners: bonus 25% of proposal is paid out 6 months — (Incentivizes project to grow value of $OCEAN).How: use streaming money protocol like Sablier or Superfluid.  <p>Voting Mechanisms</p>  Vote per proposal (Granular Voting) — Voters can vote +/- for each proposal, vs status quo of voters voting + for one of n proposals). Allows voters ability to vote &gt;1 proposal.  Quadratic voting — (1) get fixed amount of votes = # OCEAN tokens. (2) can allocate these votes among the n proposals. Vote weight on a proposal = sqrt(# votes allocated to the proposal). Requires “Vote per proposal”  <p>Funding Mechanisms</p>  Earmark min $OCEAN funding for each track or specific goal — Tracks: {Core dev, app dev, outreach, data, OceanDAO}, or more specific “data” → “climate data” and “core dev” → “documentation”. Emphasize some tracks/goals more than others by different min $OCEAN&nbsp;amounts.  Requested $OCEAN can vary (Variable Funding) among proposals, to allow for small proposals ($1K ish) and large ones ($100K ish). Capped or uncapped rounds? Maybe: no team can request &gt; ⅓ of a given round’s&nbsp;total  1–2–3 Combo — Combine Vote per proposal + $OCEAN proposed can vary + $OCEAN not granted is burned. (These play well together)  Round Funding Cap — Fund Scarcity [set = 65%] By limiting the total amount of funds available to be dispersed per round/track, incentivizes participants to be choosier with how they allocate available resources.  Continuous funding — Shift voting and grant incentives to be more long-term oriented. One example implementation is conviction voting like in Giveth or Commons&nbsp;Stack.  <p>Funding Brains</p><p>There should be mechanisms that support teams, so they can build on strong foundations. Teams that can deliver against ROI, should be able to access better grants, and execute accordingly. Variable Funding was implemented to support this. Please, request larger grants if required. Following this guideline also allows us to more easily measure ROI. The goal is not to be bureaucratic, or to enforce. This is a last resort. Ecosystem growth is the&nbsp;ethos.</p>  One-team rule. In a given funding round, a given person may only be part of a team of one funding proposal. If broken, all teams with that person are disqualified.  One-proposal rule. In a given funding round, a given team may only make one funding proposal. If broken, the team is disqualified.  <p>Growth</p>  More OCEAN to teams if voter turnout grows. Bonus +x% funding (beyond the baseline pot) to all teams in a given funding round, if the amount of OCEAN voted grows by x% compared to previous round. Note: must be by OCEAN voted, not number# wallets, because the latter can be Sybil attacked.  New Team Grants. Introduce earmarking for new teams who have never been funded before. This combines well with “$OCEAN burn”, as the community is incentivized to register new quality projects to avoid tokens being destroyed.   5. Towards Solving: Updated Funding Structure <p>To understand where we are, and where we are going, we began by deconstructing our processes, paying attention to the different funding structures that were in place, and how to resolve their immediate challenges.</p><p>OceanDAO has scaled well via decentralized community-driven proposals, and decentralized community-driven voting to curate proposals. Due to this success, it became obvious that OceanDAO should get scaled out more while applying adjustments to improve target outcomes.</p><p>Implementing Variable Funding allows OceanDAO to allocate small grants around ~$1k, up to much larger grants of $100k. This means that OceanDAO can help teams at various stages of maturity: incubate -&gt; accelerate -&gt; scale. This means we can fold Shipyard activities into OceanDAO, as well as Ambassador funding.</p><p>Another key challenge identified is the need to increase confidence in funding projects that are ROI+. We believe that when participants can vote intuitively and fund projects effectively, that we will have begun solving the&nbsp;problem.</p> 6. Towards Solving: Matching Challenges with&nbsp;Tools <p>Increasing intuition and funding confidence</p><p>Quantifying ROI is difficult. We have to simplify complex projects into an intuitive decision-making process, to facilitate voting and capital allocation decisions. This challenge is twofold as project Proposers need to be aligned with Ocean’s goals, while providing voters with the needed information to cast their votes on projects that can deliver on their promise. In order to synthesize these parameters into intuition, we have to agree on a common methodology that captures the unique goals and Product-Market-Fit risks of each&nbsp;project.</p><p>Improving our website, copy, UX, and reducing the complexity for users to engage with the decision-making process is a good first step. We can call this a top-down solution. We can then call product-market-fit, traction, ability to deliver, and efficient use of funds a bottom-up solution.</p><p>The best way to visualize both of these challenges is with a funnel. On the top of the funnel we can improve the UX to reduce complexity and improve the onboarding process. On the bottom of the funnel, we can improve how projects signal progress to the DAO, in order to report their ROI and continue investing in&nbsp;success.</p><p>By integrating mechanisms that align projects towards OceanDAO goals and Ocean high-level goals, we can increase confidence that all processes are aligned towards the greater goals, and so, invest with impunity.</p><p>One Team One&nbsp;Proposal</p><p>Some teams began working on multiple projects in a given Funding Round, while some team members became spread across multiple projects. This becomes increasingly difficult to resolve as we still experience coordination challenges.</p><p>By introducing a One Team One Proposal rule, we can more easily ensure each participant is taken care of, until we have better systems in place that can support wider decentralization efforts.</p> Eliminating funding&nbsp;barriers <p>OceanDAO biased to incubating early-stage projects with fixed grant amounts while Shipyard biased to larger grants. We can fold both into OceanDAO via two mechanisms: Variable Funding and Grant&nbsp;Ceiling.</p><p>OceanDAO had a fixed Grant amount. This forced projects to fit into a particular box. Yet not all projects are the same size. Introducing Variable Funding allows Proposers to request a grant that meets their unique needs. This improves capital efficiency. Smaller projects can now be funded more easily, while bigger projects can receive the capital needed to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>By increasing the Grant Ceiling, OceanDAO would be equipped to solve the goal of both grant programs. Proposers and Voters can now be more “penny foolish and pound wise”, more easily onboarding smaller initiatives, while focusing their efforts on the projects that have a track record, can take on the risk, and are ready to deliver big outcomes.</p><p>Ultimately both mechanisms shift the responsibility to the community to identify strong project proposers and desirable proposals, while maintaining decentralized decision&nbsp;making.</p> Decentralizing processes and reducing&nbsp;overhead <p>In OceanDAO, project proposers are vetted and funded by the community. In Shipyard, processes required more manual coordination with proposers, while centralizing the decision and funding process to the core Ocean&nbsp;team.</p><p>By providing channels for project proposers to share their proposal in OceanDAO, the community can review projects and collaborate. Web3 tooling such as Snapshot allows all participants to vote and curate which projects receive funding. Applying “DAO Tooling” to this decision-making process, shifts the overhead from the core Ocean team, to the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p>We can move these systems closer to our greater goals of decentralization by doubling down on proven processes that remove overhead, provide transparency, and shift decisions to the crowd. Retiring Shipyard then becomes an obvious, net positive decision.</p> Distributing funds across all initiatives <p>OceanDAO experienced an increasing number of teams proposing projects. This is great! Most projects were of similar flavor: “Build and Integrate”, a fundamental pillar of growth in the Ocean Ecosystem. However, we have five vectors to invest and grow including: Core Software, Unleash Data, DAO Engineering, and Outreach. Another unforeseen problem is that new teams encountered a large amount of friction, as early adopters were favored and received the majority of&nbsp;votes.</p><p>To remedy this situation, an Earmarking mechanism to signal and fund more balanced initiatives in the DAO was introduced. This has allowed OceanDAO to increase the number of Outreach projects, and New Entrants building inside OceanDAO. Both decisions represent a need for the DAO to grow its Top-of-the-Funnel metric: “Total Proposals per Funding&nbsp;Round”.</p><p>This Earmarking mechanism has a theoretical basis with roots in the Genetic Programming (GP) literature. The goal there is “diversity maintenance” so that the GP search doesn’t get stuck in local minima while being more efficient than fully-random sampling. One powerful technique is “Age-Layered Population Structure” (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a971/bb2c2cee841702b033cd01bc79f8e35b7893.pdf">ALPS</a>) with the following mental model: kindergartners compete against only the kindergartners, grade 1s against grade 1s, and so on. And, smart kids can skip grades. So, the new “less fit” kindergartners aren’t competing against grade 12s (and losing). We’ve discovered this to work extremely well <a href="http://trent.st/mojito/">in practice</a>. This can translate to a blockchain setting, such as with <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-layered-tcr-56cc5b4cdc45">The Layered TCR</a>. A super-simple version is to have just two layers: the youngest, and the rest. That’s exactly what we are doing here for OceanDAO: the youngest (0 grants received) only have to compete against the youngest.</p> 7. OceanDAO&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Below is the roadmap and schedule to integrate updates. Some of the roadmap has already been rolled out in Round 5 (May 2021) and Round 6 (June) while the remaining will be implemented in Round 7 (July) and Round 8 (August).

Conclusion &amp; Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>OceanDAO is a young DAO, established by a community of experienced builders who want to seed the future of decentralized data markets. There are many processes and groups involved in the success of the DAO, and we have to be methodical when considering how to tackle these challenges.</p><p>By formalizing challenges, deconstructing problems, and proposing a roadmap, we can begin exploring the problem-solution space and tooling that can help address each problem. Establishing better transparency and improving coordination can increase cadence, and speed up the flywheel.</p><p>One way to look at the grants DAO, is to think of it like a funnel. With the top segment representing proposals, and the bottom representing effective funding towards ROI+ projects. We can observe any part of the funnel and break it down to identify mechanisms, challenges, and solutions.</p><p>Web3 and DAO tooling is increasing in numbers every month, but there is no catch-all that solves our challenges. There are mechanisms not available in current tooling, and we need to consider alternative solutions. An example is choosing Y/N votes per proposal similarly to DASH, which has served as a good model for many years. Downvoting is a desirable feature to test with inside the DAO, but does not work well in Snapshot based on our requirements. Identifying the challenges that are mission critical, and focusing on delivering solutions against these problems, allows us to maintain velocity.</p><p>Voting is a core system that deserves special attention as it’s a well known attack vector. To continue building together at scale, we have to start addressing potential risks. More so, in order to implement many incentive mechanisms we have to resolve the challenge of Sybil tolerance. Quadratic Voting is an elegant solution to many of these challenges, and so, we have begun efforts to move this&nbsp;forward.</p><p>To distribute funds effectively, we have to implement processes that scale coordination efforts between OPF, proposers, voters, and the community at large. Sunsetting Shipyard also allows OceanDAO to increase the funding ceiling. The introduction of solutions like Variable Funding, serve to provide support for both small projects, and professional teams&nbsp;alike.</p><p>Finally, everyone benefits from rewarding those that help grow OceanDAO. Introducing incentive mechanisms for voters and proposers, artificially grows engagement at the top of the DAO funnel. Helping both teams that are building great projects, and voters who are facilitating important decision-making. Similarly, by rewarding project proposers who are bringing in new participants, and earmarking funds to New Entrants to build in the DAO, we can optimize the DAO funnel, mechanically reduce friction, and increase efficiency for all contributors growing the ecosystem.</p><p>By laying down the goals, challenges, tools, and considerations being paid to the overall development of OceanDAO, a roadmap can be formulated, and more transparency can be provided. Our goal is to onboard the community with the outcomes and challenges we are facing, to establish a platform where we can identify new opportunities for collaboration, and to continue improving the DAO for all contributors embarking on this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>…</p><p>This blog was written in consideration of all staff, teams, and community members, whose commitment and feedback allows OceanDAO to continue improving.

 Ontology at Consensus 2021: Why Digital Identity Systems Must Be Decentralized In Order To Bring About A New Era In Data&nbsp;Privacy  Last week Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, took part in a fireside chat at Consensus 2021. <p>It’s that time of year again; the blockchain industry’s flagship event kicked off in style last week and the Ontology team was out in force. Getting things under way on the first day, our Founder, Li Jun, was honoured to hold a fireside chat on “Why Digital Identity Systems Must Be Decentralized In Order To Bring About A New Era In Data Privacy”. The insightful discussion touched on the blockchain and crypto industry, as well as honing in on Ontology’s core offering, including our DID solutions, OScore, and Wing&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>If you didn’t manage to catch Li Jun’s chat, we’ve got you covered! Below is a recap of some of the highlights.</p><p>The Future Of Decentralized Identity Will Put Personal Data In The User’s&nbsp;Control</p><p>Digital identity is not just a passport or an identity card; it has multiple elements, and it is the cornerstone of our offering. Your digital identity can include anything from your ethnic background or your work experience, to your interests and habits, or your favorite places to shop. Ontology’s decentralized identity offering allows you, the user, to control your personal data without a single centralized service maintaining it. For instance, if you wanted to prove your identity to a third party but the only actual information they needed to verify was your nationality, you could share this one piece of data with the third party while keeping your name, date of birth, home address, and any other relevant data points,&nbsp;private.</p><p>Currently, centralized services do not provide this option for individuals. Such identity protocols are flawed because they rely on trust between three parties. For instance, the identity issuers, who are the trusted parties that attest to their validity, the holders, to whom the credentials are issued, and the verifiers, who are responsible for authenticating that the identification is correct. This leaves parties open to human error and duplicitous misuse of data access. While data breaches are gaining in prevalence across the world, this archaic process can only stand to negatively impact the future of digital identity. Luckily, blockchain has provided us with the solution, and we at Ontology are aiming to give the control of data back to the data owners in the form of a cohesive, decentralized identity.</p><p>Decentralized Identity And Data Both Need More Adoption To&nbsp;Mature</p><p>There is an inextricable link between decentralized identity and decentralized data; decentralized identity is more like a connector or an index, which maps the user to each different source of decentralized data. Decentralized data applies to everything, as each piece of data will eventually link back to an end user or identity. The two protocols are similar and work in tandem, and have been applied to complex decentralized corporations and organizations. The greater the interplay between these two protocols grows, the more likely they will be used in different countries and by governments. With greater adoption comes greater maturation, larger data infrastructures, and finer data ecosystems.</p><p>The Blockchain Industry Has Not Focused On Decentralized Data Or Identity Heavily; That Is About To&nbsp;Change</p><p>The blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and currently, the focus remains predominantly on digital assets and market movement. Little over four years ago when we were planning the launch of the public Ontology blockchain, we never expected there to be as much interest in this space as there currently is. People’s concept of identity is rapidly changing as trust in centralized data storage erodes and we expect this to continue in the coming years. Data is perceived as an asset and it can bring real profits for organizations and Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Google. Here, the individual has access to their data yet they do not own it as it is stored on a centralized platform. While individuals can access their data, they can only store said data on these centralized databases themselves; a user cannot move their data off of Facebook to store in another place. Blockchain technology and decentralized data solves for this, as they bring the tools directly to the individual, rather than through a centralized server. In doing this, blockchain will give sovereignty to users. By using Ontology’s solutions, the individual owns the data and can authenticate a third party to access said data, positioning Ontology’s solution at the fore of this revolution.</p><p>Ontology Will Invert Users’ Relationships With Their Data, Placing Them In&nbsp;Control</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions provide integrity and authenticity in data security. It gives control of personal data back to individuals in the form of a digital identity. As our identity begins to grow and evolve over time, our digital footprint becomes greater and the amount of data points identifying us grows, increasing the risk of manipulation. Inverting the existing relationship users have with data and placing the control in their hands is an imperative for us at Ontology. We strongly believe that these decentralized identity and decentralized data frameworks are the way of the future. By doing this, we also leave open plenty of possibilities: you could be the co-owner of your data with a centralized party, which does not mean you must move your data to that centralized server, you can still put your data into one or multiple centralized storage services. The difference here is that you control the data: you can authenticate the data to another third partner service, be it a financial institution or an insurance company, meaning your data is under your&nbsp;control.</p><p>Our identity continues to grow and evolve in complexity, making it more scattered among different centralized systems. With a decentralized identity like ONT ID, users can rest easy knowing that their data will only be stored where they want it to be stored, or shared with whomever they want to share it with; rather than being sold to third parties to advance a companies’ advertising goals. Users allow access to the specific data they want to share and decide whom they wish to share it with. The future of data is decentralized, and we are more committed than ever to be pioneering this effort to bring about a new era of data&nbsp;privacy.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

We completed 95% of the Ontology EVM-integrated design, which will make Ontology compatible with Ethereum smart contract ecology after completion.  30% of ETH RPC support has been completed.  40% of Ontology’s new Ethereum account system has been completed.  The research on the latest progress of Layer 2 technology has been completed, which explores the integration of Ethereum Layer 2 on the Ontology&nbsp;MainNet.  <p>Product Development</p>  This month, we released ONTO v3.8.4, adding support for the Solana chain and the upgraded OKExChain MainNet.  The ONTO x Cafeswap and ONTO x Apeswap mining activities are still ongoing. ONTO also successfully hosted Wing Flash Pool OKExChain launch&nbsp;party.  ONTO collaborated with bloXroute to launch ETH frontrunning protection, which helps to safeguard the rights of wallet&nbsp;users.  <p>dApps</p>  As of May 24, 2021, there were 115 dApps launched in total on&nbsp;MainNet.  There have been a total of 15,637,190 dApp transactions completed on&nbsp;MainNet.  We recorded 37,829 dApp-related transactions in the past&nbsp;month.  <p>Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty</p>  May was another exciting month for community growth as we welcomed 1,153 new members across Ontology’s global ecosystem. As always, we welcome anyone who is interested in Ontology to join&nbsp;us!  Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology, held two Community Calls on Discord on May 6 and May 20. This was an opportunity for Ontology’s community members to review the Ontology ecosystem.  Dumont, Ontology’s Telegram admin, published the article <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/how-to-get-your-first-ong-90583d5f0623">How To Get Your First ONG</a>.

The release of this new version will help satisfy users’ high-frequency trading&nbsp;needs.  Ontology’s Chief Scientist, Kendall Mao was invited to the IEEE Computer Society Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Standards Committee Plenary &amp; P3200S WG Meeting, where he discussed how to accelerate the development of core standards for blockchain and build a global blockchain ecosystem with more than 70 representatives from 55&nbsp;units.    It was a great month for media coverage. Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was featured in Forbes, CoinDesk, and Forkast News, sharing his thoughts on the future of the DeFi industry and how Ontology and SAGA are creating a regulatory framework for decentralization.  Li Jun also published an article in Nasdaq titled, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-solution-to-the-internets-data-hoarding-problem-2021-05-05">“The Solution to the Internet’s Data Hoarding Problem”</a>. The article delves into the idea that SSI solutions can help users share data while protecting their&nbsp;privacy.  Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, published a paper titled “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/doi/10.1162/dint_a_00095/101024/OpenKG-Chain-A-Blockchain-Infrastructure-for-Open">OpenKG Chain: A Blockchain Infrastructure for Open Knowledge Graphs</a>”, exploring blockchain-based open knowledge infrastructure.  Crypto Briefing recently released a guide for decentralized identity. ONT ID is listed in the guide as one of the top three decentralized identity solutions since ONT ID has practical applications and could be used on multiple blockchains.  Ontology’s 14-day chain statistics report for April and May has been published. From April 25 to May 8, the number of transactions on the Ontology chain, the number of active addresses, the total number of addresses, and the ONT ID data all showed an overall growth trend. This reflects a tremendous increase in new and existing users of self-sovereign decentralized digital identities.

			 Nell’ultimo report per la Firma digitale di Gartner, InfoCert è stata individuata come “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform” che la posiziona tra i leader del settore Firma Digitale. 
<p>La società di consulenza Gartner che da oltre 40 anni svolge il suo autorevole ruolo di IT Advisor, ha rilasciato la sua guida per il Mercato della eSignature dal titolo “Market Guide for Electronic Signature”, un report che è un vero e proprio punto di riferimento per professionisti e aziende del settore IT e soluzioni tecnologiche, classificando InfoCert tra i principali Provider per le soluzioni di Firma Digitale.</p>
<p>Lo scopo dell’analisi operata da Gartner è quello di guidare professionisti e imprese nella valutazione delle soluzioni presenti sul mercato offerte dai diversi provider in ambito Firma Digitale e Servizi Fiduciari. Il report di Gartner suddivide i provider del mercato della Firma Digitale e dei Servizi Fiduciari in tre diverse categorie, InfoCert viene e inserita fra i “Full Service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, ossia coloro che possono fornire servizi ad alta flessibilità tecnologica e di processo, &nbsp;comprensivi di tutte le caratteristiche tecnologiche necessarie a rispondere alle esigenze di Aziende di grandi, medie e piccole dimensioni, fino a coprire le necessità del singolo cittadino.</p>

			<p>Il report è molto utile per classificare i diversi fornitori a seconda delle specifiche capacità e livelli di servizio offerti. È un’ottima fonte dalla quale si possono analizzare gli ultimi Use Case in ambito B2B, B2C e B2E e dà inoltre una vista puntuale sui più recenti requisiti necessari in ambito “Assurance” (ossia del rispetto degli standard di garanzia così come indicato nelle diverse normative europee di riferimento) come in quello tecnologico, aspetti nei quali un’azienda dovrebbe porre particolare attenzione qualora volesse intraprendere un percorso di Trasformazione Digitale.</p>
<p>Il segmento “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, all’interno del quale InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i leader del settore, è quello che raggruppa i Provider che riescono ad adattarsi meglio ad ogni esigenza del cliente, secondo Gartner infatti, questi Provider possono supportare sia firme elettroniche semplici che quelle avanzate e qualificate, nelle loro soluzioni Enterprise possono venire integrati processi specifici per settore industriale, possono offrire soluzioni “out-of-the-box”, integrabili a piattaforme e software terze parti come Documentali, HCMs, CRMs e CLMs. Infine, supportano anche tool di integrazione API, di Identity verification e knowledge-base verification.</p>
<p>Il report prosegue analizzando le altre due categorie di fornitore che sono: “Stand-alone, workflow-focused, click-to-sign electronic signature platoform” e gli “Enterprise digital signature provider”.</p>
<p>Il team di analisti che ha curato la stesura del report, focalizza la sua attenzione sul fatto che il cliente debba poter accedere a servizi che si adeguino alle proprie esigenze, alle aree geografiche di proprio interesse (caratterizzate spesso da esigenze normative diverse) e al caso d’uso che prende come riferimento. Per questo motivo è essenziale che esso venga messo in grado di poter scegliere il fornitore che soddisfi al meglio i criteri di funzionalità e compliance durante tutte le fasi del processo in questione.</p>
<p>GoSign, la soluzione di firma di InfoCert, è ormai un punto di riferimento sul mercato grazie alla sua versatilità. La possibilità di firmare su qualsiasi dispositivo, di utilizzare diverse tipologie di firma e di personalizzare la soluzione con processi verticali, consente alle aziende di velocizzare i processi approvativi e quelli di firma verso clienti e fornitori.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes traces its lineage <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes/">directly from Borg</a>, Google’s long-rumored internal container-oriented cluster-management system.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot and Spring Cloud were some of the pioneering frameworks in Javaland. However, even they stood on the shoulders of giants when they leveraged Netflix’s open-source projects to embrace and extend. In 2018, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0">Netflix OSS announced they’d come full circle</a>, and adopted Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’d like to show you how to build and deploy (with Kubernetes) a reactive microservice architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and JHipster. Why reactive? Because Spring Cloud Gateway is now the default for JHipster 7 gateways, even if you choose to build your microservices with Spring MVC.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Spring Cloud Gateway is a library for building an API Gateway on top of Spring WebFlux. It easily integrates with OAuth to communicate between microservices. You just need to add a <code>TokenRelay</code> filter.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay</code> 
 
 
 






Spring Cloud no longer supports Netflix Zuul. An <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/36">open issue</a> adds Spring MVC/Servlet support to Spring Cloud Gateway. It’s scheduled for implementation before the end of 2021.

 A Brief Intro to Kubernetes (K8s) 
 
 
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source project from Google that provides an API for deploying your apps and making them talk with each other. It helps automate deployments and updates, and manages your apps and services with limited downtime. You use Docker containers and YAML to make it all work.</p>
 
 
<p>The YAML can be burdensome, but that’s where JHipster comes in. It can generate the YAML for you!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Kubernetes-Ready Microservices Architecture 
 
 
<p>I showed you how to build <a>Reactive Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> in a previous post. Today, I’ll show you how to generate K8s deployment descriptors, use Spring Cloud Config with Git, encrypt your secrets, and make it all work on Google Cloud (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/">GKE</a> to be specific).</p>
 
 
<p>Start by cloning the JHipster 7 { Vue, Spring Boot, WebFlux } reactive microservices project from GitHub:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you just want to see the completed project, just cd into the project’s <code>jhipster-k8s</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../jhipster-k8s</code> 
 
 



 
 
<p>This project has four directories:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>gateway</code>: a Spring Boot + Spring Cloud Gateway project configured for OpenID Connect (OIDC) login. It’s also configured as an OAuth 2.0 resource server. It contains a front-end application built with Vue.</p>
 
 
<p><code>blog</code>: a Spring Boot + WebFlux microservice that talks to a Neo4j database.</p>
 
 
<p><code>store</code>: a Spring Boot + WebFlux microservice that uses MongoDB.</p>
 
 
<p><code>docker-compose</code>: a set of Docker files that describe how to run all containers together.</p>
 
 
 
 






The SPA app on the gateway is currently a monolith. The JHipster team is still working on <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10189">micro frontends support</a>.



 
 
<p>If you don’t have JHipster installed, install it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Generate Kubernetes Deployment Descriptors 
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <code>reactive-jhipster</code> directory. Next, create a <code>k8s</code> directory, cd into it, and run JHipster’s <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">Kubernetes sub-generator</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir k8s
cd k8s
jhipster k8s</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted with several questions. Answer them as I did below:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Type of application: Microservice application</p>
 
 
<p>Root directory: ../</p>
 
 
<p>Which applications? &lt;select all&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Set up monitoring? No</p>
 
 
<p>Which applications with clustered databases? select store</p>
 
 
<p>Admin password for JHipster Registry: &lt;generate one&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes namespace: demo</p>
 
 
<p>Docker repository name: &lt;your docker hub username&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Command to push Docker image: <code>docker push</code></p>
 
 
<p>Enable Istio? No</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes service type? LoadBalancer</p>
 
 
<p>Use dynamic storage provisioning? Yes</p>
 
 
<p>Use a specific storage class? &lt;leave empty&gt;</p>
 
 
 
 






If you don’t want to publish your images on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, leave the Docker repository name blank.



 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>After I answered these questions, my <code>k8s/.yo-rc.json</code> file had the following contents:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "appsFolders": ["blog", "gateway", "store"],
    "directoryPath": "../",
    "clusteredDbApps": ["store"],
    "serviceDiscoveryType": "eureka",
    "jwtSecretKey": "NDFhMGY4NjF...",
    "dockerRepositoryName": "mraible",
    "dockerPushCommand": "docker push",
    "kubernetesNamespace": "demo",
    "kubernetesServiceType": "LoadBalancer",
    "kubernetesUseDynamicStorage": true,
    "kubernetesStorageClassName": "",
    "ingressDomain": "",
    "monitoring": "no",
    "istio": false
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I already showed you how to get everything working with Docker Compose <a> in the previous tutorial</a>. So today, I’d like to show you how to run things locally with <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">Minikube</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Install Minikube to Run Kubernetes Locally 
 
 
<p>If you have Docker installed, you can run Kubernetes locally with Minikube. Run <code>minikube start</code> to begin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>minikube --cpus 8 start</code> 
 
 
 






If this doesn’t work, use <code>brew install minikube</code>, or see <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/">Minikube’s installation instructions</a>.



 
 
<p>This command will start Minikube with 16 GB of RAM and 8 CPUs. Unfortunately, the default, which is 16 GB RAM and two CPUs, did not work for me.</p>
 
 
<p>You can skip ahead to creating your Docker images while you wait for this to complete.</p>
 
 
<p>After this command executes, it’ll print out a message and notify you which cluster and namespace are being used.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default</code> 
 
 
 






You can stop Minikube with <code>minikube stop</code> and start over with <code>minikube delete</code>.



 
 
 
 
 Create Docker Images with Jib 
 
 
<p>Now, you need to build Docker images for each app. In the {<code>gateway</code>, <code>blog</code>, <code>store</code> } directories, run the following Gradle command (where <code>&lt;image-name&gt;</code> is <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, or <code>blog</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>This command should also be in the window where you ran <code>jhipster k8s</code>, so you can copy them from there.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create Private Docker Images 
 
<p>You can also build your images locally and publish them to your Docker daemon. This is the default if you didn’t specify a base Docker repository name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># this command exposes Docker images to minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)
./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Because this publishes your images locally to Docker, you’ll need to make modifications to your Kubernetes deployment files to use <code>imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: gateway-app
  image: gateway
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make sure to add this <code>imagePullPolicy</code> to the following files:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>k8s/gateway-k8s/gateway-deployment.yml</code></p>
 
 
<p><code>k8s/blog-k8s/blog-deployment.yml</code></p>
 
 
<p><code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Register an OIDC App for Auth 
 
 
<p>You’ve now built Docker images for your microservices, but you haven’t seen them running. First, you’ll need to configure Okta for authentication and authorization.</p>
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>JHipster ships with <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a>. It acts as a Eureka service for service discovery and contains a Spring Cloud Config server for distributing your configuration settings.</p>
 
 
<p>Update <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> to contain your OIDC settings from the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI just created. The Spring Cloud Config server reads from this file and shares the values with the gateway and microservices.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication, modify <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that you’ve configured everything, it’s time to see it in action.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Start Your Spring Boot Microservices with K8s 
 
 
<p>In the <code>k8s</code> directory, start your engines!</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can see if everything starts up using the following command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get pods -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use the name of a pod with <code>kubectl logs</code> to tail its logs.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>. You’ll need to sign in with your Okta credentials.</p>
 
 
<p>Once all is green, use port-forwarding to see the gateway app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you should be able to add blogs, posts, tags, and products.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also automate testing to ensure that everything works. Set your Okta credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests using Cypress (from the gateway directory).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;your-password&gt;
npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Proof it worked for me:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Plain Text Secrets? Uggh! 
 
<p>You may notice that I used a secret in plain text in the <code>application-configmap.yml</code> file. Secrets in plain text are a bad practice! I hope you didn’t check everything into source control yet!!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your Secrets with Spring Cloud Config 
 
 
<p>The JHipster Registry has an encryption mechanism you can use to encrypt your secrets. That way, it’s safe to store them in public repositories.</p>
 
 
<p>Add an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to the environment variables in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: really-long-string-of-random-charters-that-you-can-keep-safe</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>You can use JShell to generate a UUID you can use for your encrypt key.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jshell

UUID.randomUUID()</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can quit by typing <code>/exit</code>.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Restart your JHipster Registry containers from the <code>k8s</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your OIDC Client Secret 
 
<p>You can encrypt your client secret by logging into <code><a href="http://localhost:8761">http://localhost:8761</a></code> and going to Configuration &gt; Encryption. If this address doesn’t resolve, you’ll need to port-forward again.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy and paste your client secret from <code>application-configmap.yml</code> (or <code>.okta.env</code>) and click Encrypt.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Then, copy the encrypted value back into <code>application-configmap.yml</code>. Make sure to wrap it in quotes!</p>
 
 
<p>You can also use curl:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl -X POST http://admin:&lt;password-you-set-earlier&gt;@localhost:8761/config/encrypt -d your-client-secret</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you use curl, make sure to add <code>{cipher}</code> to the beginning of the string. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>client-secret: "{cipher}1b12934716c32d360c85f651a0793df2777090c..."</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Apply these changes and restart all deployments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Verify everything still works at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 
 






If you don’t want to restart the Spring Cloud Config server when you update its configuration, see <a>Refresh the Configuration in Your Spring Cloud Config Server</a>.



 
 
 
 Change Spring Cloud Config to use Git 
 
<p>You might want to store your app’s configuration externally. That way, you don’t have to redeploy everything to change values. Good news! Spring Cloud Config makes it easy to switch to Git instead of the filesystem to store your configuration.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, find the following variables:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_0_TYPE
  value: native
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_0_SEARCH_LOCATIONS
  value: file:./central-config</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Below these values, add a second lookup location.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_TYPE
  value: git
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_URI
  value: https://github.com/mraible/reactive-java-ms-config/
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_SEARCH_PATHS
  value: config
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_LABEL
  value: main</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a GitHub repo that matches the URI, path, and branch you entered.</p>
 
 
<p>In my case, I created <a href="https://github.com/mraible/reactive-java-ms-config/">reactive-java-ms-config</a> and added a <code>config/application.yml</code> file in the <code>main</code> branch. Then, I added my <code>spring.security.*</code> values to it and removed them from <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>See Spring Cloud Config’s <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/multi/multi__spring_cloud_config_server.html#_git_backend">Git Backend docs</a> for more information.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Deploy Spring Boot Microservices to Google Cloud (aka GCP) 
 
 
<p>It’s nice to see things running locally on your machine, but it’s even better to get to production! In this section, I’ll show you how to deploy your containers to Google Cloud.</p>
 
 
<p>First, stop Minikube if you were running it previously.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>minikube stop</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can also use <code>kubectl</code> commands to switch clusters.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context XXX</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The cool kids use <code>kubectx</code> and <code>kubens</code> to set the default context and namespace. You can learn how to install and use them via the <a href="https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx">kubectx GitHub project</a>.</p>
 
 
 Create a Container Registry on Google Cloud 
 
<p>Before the JHipster 7.0.0 release, I tested this microservice example with Kubernetes and Google Cloud. I found many solutions in Ray Tsang’s <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/">Spring Boot on GCP Guides</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1372964263237718026">Thanks, Ray</a>!</p>
 
 
<p>To start with Google Cloud, you’ll need an account and a project. <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/getting-started/google-cloud-platform">Sign up for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>, log in, and create a project. Open a <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">console</a> in your browser. A GCP project contains all cloud services and resources—​such as virtual machines, network, load balancers—​that you might use.</p>
 
 






You can also download and install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/"><code>gcloud</code> CLI</a> if you want to run things locally.



 
 
<p>Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API and Container Registry:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Kubernetes Cluster 
 
<p>Run the following command to create a cluster for your apps.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--zone us-central1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I called my cluster <code>reactive-ms</code>. See GCP’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/">zones</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types/">machine-types</a> for other options. I found the <code>n1-standard-4</code> to be the minimum for JHipster.</p>
 
 
<p>You created Docker images earlier to run with Minikube. Then, those images were deployed to Docker Hub or your local Docker registry. If you deployed to Docker Hub, you can use your deployment files as-is.</p>
 
 
<p>For Google Cloud and its Kubernetes engine (GKE), you can also publish your images to your project’s registry. Thankfully, this is easy to do with Jib.</p>
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <code>gateway</code> directory and run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/gateway</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can get your project ID by running <code>gcloud projects list</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Repeat the process for <code>blog</code> and <code>store</code>. You can run these processes in parallel to speed things up.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/blog
cd ../store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/store</code> 
 
 
 






You might have to run <code>gcloud auth configure-docker</code> for Jib to publish to your GCP container registry.



 
 
<p>Then, in your <code>k8s/*/-deployment.yml</code> files, add <code>gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;</code> as a prefix. Remove the <code>imagePullPolicy</code> if you specified it earlier. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>containers:
  - name: gateway-app
    image: gcr.io/jhipster7/gateway
    env:</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In the <code>k8s</code> directory, apply all the deployment descriptors to run all your images.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can monitor the progress of your deployments with <code>kubectl get pods -n demo</code>.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you make a mistake configuring JHipster Registry and need to deploy it, you can do so with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml -n demo
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/jhipster-registry -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to restart all your deployments if you changed any configuration settings that services need to retrieve.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl rollout restart deploy -n demo</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 Access Your Gateway on Google Cloud 
 
<p>Once everything is up and running, get the external IP of your gateway.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get svc gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to add the external IP address as a valid redirect to your Okta OIDC app. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, and edit it.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the standard JHipster redirect URIs using the IP address. For example, <code>http://34.71.48.244:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> for the login redirect URI, and <code>http://34.71.48.244:8080</code> for the logout redirect URI.</p>
 
 
<p>You can use the following command to set your gateway’s IP address as a variable you can curl.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc gateway -n demo -ojsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
curl $EXTERNAL_IP:8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run <code>open http://$EXTERNAL_IP:8080</code>, and you should be able to sign in.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Great! Now that you know things work, let’s integrate better security, starting with HTTPS.</p>
 
 
 
 Add HTTPS to Your Reactive Gateway 
 
<p>You should always use HTTPS. It’s one of the easiest ways to secure things, especially with the free certificates offered these days. Ray Tsang’s <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/deployment/kubernetes/load-balancing/external-load-balancing">External Load Balancing docs</a> was a big help in figuring out all these steps.</p>
 
 
<p>You’ll need a static IP to assign your TLS (the official name for HTTPS) certificate.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud compute addresses create gateway-ingress-ip --global</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can run the following command to make sure it worked.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud compute addresses describe gateway-ingress-ip --global --format='value(address)'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create a <code>k8s/ingress.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: gateway
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "gateway-ingress-ip"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /*
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: gateway
            port:
              number: 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy it and make sure it worked.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f ingress.yml -n demo

# keep running this command displays an IP address
# (hint: up arrow recalls the last command)
kubectl get ingress gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To use a TLS certificate, you must have a fully qualified domain name and configure it to point to the IP address. If you don’t have a real domain, you can use <a href="https://nip.io/">nip.io</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Set the IP in a variable, as well as the domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get ingress gateway -ojsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
DOMAIN="${EXTERNAL_IP}.nip.io"

# Prove it works
echo $DOMAIN
curl $DOMAIN</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To create a certificate, create a <code>k8s/certificate.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; certificate.yml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: gateway-certificate
spec:
  domains:
  # Replace the value with your domain name
  - ${DOMAIN}
EOF</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the certificate to <code>ingress.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
metadata:
  name: gateway
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "gateway-ingress-ip"
    networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: "gateway-certificate"
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy both files:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f certificate.yml -f ingress.yml -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Check your certificate’s status until it prints <code>Status: ACTIVE</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl describe managedcertificate gateway-certificate -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>While you’re waiting, you can proceed to forcing HTTPS in the next step.</p>
 
 
 
 Force HTTPS with Spring Security 
 
<p>Spring Security’s WebFlux support makes it easy to <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.5.x/reference/html5/#webflux-http-redirect">redirect to HTTPS</a>. However, if you redirect all HTTPS requests, the Kubernetes health checks will fail because they receive a 302 instead of a 200.</p>
 
 
<p>Crack open <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> in the gateway project and add the following code to the <code>springSecurityFilterChain()</code> method.</p>
 
 
 src/main/java/…​/gateway/config/SecurityConfiguration.java 
 
 <code>http.redirectToHttps(redirect -&gt; redirect
    .httpsRedirectWhen(e -&gt; e.getRequest().getHeaders().containsKey("X-Forwarded-Proto"))
);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Rebuild the Docker image for the gateway project.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/gateway</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run the following commands to start a rolling restart of gateway instances:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl rollout restart deployment gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 






Run <code>kubectl get deployments</code> to see your deployment names.



 
 
<p>Now you should get a 302 when you access your domain. <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a> is a useful alternative to curl.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Update your Okta OIDC app to have <code>https://${DOMAIN}/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> as a valid redirect URI. Add <code>https://${DOMAIN}.nip.io</code> to the sign-out redirect URIs too.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your Kubernetes Secrets 
 
 
<p>Congratulations! Now you have everything running on GKE, using HTTPS! However, you have a lot of plain-text secrets in your K8s YAML files.</p>
 
 
<p>"But, wait!" you might say. Doesn’t <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Kubernetes Secrets</a> solve everything?</p>
 
 
<p>In my opinion, no. They’re just unencrypted base64-encoded strings stored in YAML files. There’s a good chance you’ll want to check in the <code>k8s</code> directory you created.</p>
 
 
<p>Having secrets in your source code is a bad idea! The good news is most people (where most people = my followers) manage secrets externally.</p>
 
 
<blockquote><p>What's your favorite way to protect secrets in your <a href="https://twitter.com/kubernetesio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@kubernetesio</a> YAML files?</p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1387439868444397568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2021</a></blockquote>

 The Current State of Secret Management in Kubernetes 
 
<p>I recently noticed a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_bilar/status/1379845799086022661">Daniel Jacob Bilar</a> that links to a talk from FOSDEM 2021 on the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/kubernetes_secret_management/">current state of secret management within Kubernetes</a>. It’s an excellent overview of the various options.</p>
 
 
 
 Store Secrets in Git with Sealed Secrets and Kubeseal 
 
<p><a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">Sealed Secrets</a> Apache-licensed open source project. Its README explains how it works.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>Problem: "I can manage all my K8s config in git, except Secrets."</p>
 
 
<p>Solution: Encrypt your Secret into a SealedSecret, which is safe to store - even to a public repository. The SealedSecret can be decrypted only by the controller running in the target cluster, and nobody else (not even the original author) is able to obtain the original Secret from the SealedSecret.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p><a href="https://dev.to/stack-labs/store-your-kubernetes-secrets-in-git-thanks-to-kubeseal-hello-sealedsecret-2i6h">Store your Kubernetes Secrets in Git thanks to Kubeseal. Hello SealedSecret!</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/aurelievache">Aurélie Vache</a> provides an excellent overview of how to use it.</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to install the Sealed Secrets CRD (Custom Resource Definition).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.16.0/controller.yaml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line or an <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">online base64 decoder</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Put the raw value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.16.0">the release notes</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>brew install kubeseal</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The major item you need to encrypt in this example is the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> you used to encrypt the OIDC client secret. Run the following command to do this, where the value comes from your <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl create secret generic encrypt-key \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='your-value-here' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, use <code>kubeseal</code> to convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Remove the original secrets file and deploy your sealed secrets.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm secrets.yml
kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret encrypt-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Configure JHipster Registry to use the Sealed Secret 
 
<p>In <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, change the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to use your new secret.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: encrypt-key
      key: ENCRYPT_KEY</code> 
 
 
 






You should be able to encrypt other secrets, like your database passwords, using a similar technique.



 
 
<p>Now, redeploy JHipster Registry and restart all your deployments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry locally.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Google Cloud Secret Manager 
 
<p>Google Cloud has a <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/app-dev/cloud-services/secret-management">Secret Manager</a> you can use to store your secrets. There’s even a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-gcp/current/reference/html/#secret-manager">Spring Boot starter</a> to make it convenient to retrieve these values in your app.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, you could store your database password in a properties file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.datasource.password=${sm://my-db-password}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This is pretty slick, but I like to remain cloud-agnostic. Also, I like how the JHipster Registry allows me to store encrypted secrets in Git.</p>
 
 
 
 Use Spring Vault for External Secrets 
 
<p>Using an external key management solution like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a> is also recommended. The JHipster Registry will have <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry/pull/498">Vault support in its next release</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, I recommend reading <a>Secure Secrets With Spring Cloud Config and Vault</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Scale Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>You can scale your instances using the <code>kubectl scale</code> command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl scale deployments/store --replicas=2 -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Scaling will work just fine for the microservice apps because they’re set up as OAuth 2.0 resource servers and are therefore stateless.</p>
 
 
<p>However, the gateway uses Spring Security’s OIDC login feature and stores the access tokens in the session. So if you scale it, sessions won’t be shared. Single sign-on should still work; you’ll just have to do the OAuth dance to get tokens if you hit a different instance.</p>
 
 
<p>To synchronize sessions, you can use <a>Spring Session and Redis</a> with JHipster.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you leave everything running on Google Cloud, you will be charged for usage. Therefore, I recommend removing your cluster or deleting your namespace (<code>kubectl delete ns demo</code>) to reduce your cost.</p>
 
 
 
 gcloud container clusters delete &lt;cluster-name&gt; --zone=us-central1-a 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Monitor Your Kubernetes Cluster with K9s 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Using <code>kubectl</code> to monitor your Kubernetes cluster can get tiresome. That’s where <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">K9s</a> can be helpful. It provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. K9s was created by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kitesurfer">Fernand Galiana</a>. He’s also created a commercial version called <a href="https://k9salpha.io/">K9sAlpha</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>To install it on macOS, run <code>brew install k9s</code>. Then run <code>k9s -n demo</code> to start it. You can navigate to your pods, select them with Return, and navigate back up with Esc.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>There’s also <a href="https://github.com/kdash-rs/kdash">KDash</a>, from JHipster co-lead, <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105">Deepu K Sasidharan</a>. It’s a simple K8s terminal dashboard built with Rust. Deepu recently <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105/status/1383017556546584578">released an MVP of the project</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>If for some reason you don’t like CLI’s, you can try <a href="https://www.kubernetic.com/">Kubernetic</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Continuous Integration and Delivery of JHipster Microservices 
 
 
<p>This tutorial doesn’t mention continuous integration and delivery of your reactive microservice architecture. I plan to cover that in a future post. If you have a solution you like, please leave a comment.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Spring on Google Cloud Platform 
 
 
<p>JHipster uses Docker containers to run all its databases in this example. However, there are a number of Google Cloud services you can use as alternatives. See the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp">Spring Cloud GCP project on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>
 
 
<p>I didn’t mention Testcontainers in this post. However, <a href="https://atomfrede.gitlab.io/2019/05/jhipster-with-testcontainers/">JHipster does support using them</a>. Testcontainers also has a <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/gcloud/">GCloud Module</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Why Not Istio? 
 
 
<p>I didn’t use Istio in this example because I didn’t want to complicate things. Learning Kubernetes is hard enough without learning another system on top of it. Istio acts as a network between your containers that can do networky things like authentication, authorization, monitoring, and retries. I like to think of it as AOP for containers.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see how to use JHipster with Istio, see <a href="https://dev.to/deepu105/how-to-set-up-java-microservices-with-istio-service-mesh-on-kubernetes-5bkn">How to set up Java microservices with Istio service mesh on Kubernetes</a> by JHipster co-lead <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105">Deepu K Sasidharan</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Fernand Galiana recommends checking out BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a>. Cilium is open source software for transparently providing and securing the network and API connectivity between application services deployed using Linux container management platforms such as Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Kubernetes, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>This blog post showed you how to deploy your reactive Java microservices to production using Kubernetes. JHipster did much of the heavy lifting for you since it generated all the YAML-based deployment descriptors. Since no one really likes writing YAML, I’m calling that a win!</p>
 
 
<p>You learned how to use JHipster Registry to encrypt your secrets and configure Git as a configuration source for Spring Cloud Config. Bitnami’s Sealed Secrets is a nice companion to encrypt the secrets in your Kubernetes deployment descriptors.</p>

<p>We hosted Part 1 of a talk series called Tools for Thought Interchange on May 27th, 2021. Tools for Thought — also known as second brains, digital gardens, or simply personal note taking apps — is seeing a lot of interest right now, with more being built every day. The question we posed was: how do we work on interchange between these systems?</p><p>Not just import or export (although those play a role as well). Rather, can we work on ways to interchange data between systems in a way that preserves the unique capabilities of each system, while also allowing users and developers to more easily use different tools to work with their own data?</p><p>It became clear that many people were interested. We talked to a number of speakers about presenting, and ideally it will turn it into a community of interest and speaker series of its own, distinct from our Fission Tech Talk Thursdays.</p> Fission Building Blocks for Tools for Thought <p>Fission provides a <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative">Webnative SDK </a>for developers that provides portable identity, end-to-end encrypted data &amp; file storage, and web publishing today. This is perfect for the peace of mind of your important second brain notes, without being stuck in a single SaaS database.</p><p>On the public side, the permanent content addressing and graph structure of the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> has the potential to be a commons network that helps with annotation and linking of tools for thought resources.</p><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">TiddlyWiki already has a Fission enabled app</a>, and previous presenters like <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/kosmik-app-tool-for-thought-ipfs-database/">Kosmik App</a> are also building on IPFS for global data.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by the Fission Discord chat to find out more »</a></p> Part 1 Presentations <p>Here are the presentations, notes, and video from Part 1. <a href="https://lu.ma/yd1w65cq">Join us for Part 2 on June 3rd »</a></p> Blaine Cook: atJSON as potential format for interchange <p><a href="https://twitter.com/blaine">Blaine Cook</a> kicked us off as the main presentation for the first event. He has been working at Condé Nast on atJSON, which has this to say in its <a href="https://github.com/CondeNast/atjson">GitHub README</a>:</p><blockquote>For Condé Nast, it is essential for our stories to be a format that doesn’t age quickly – we have over a hundred years of articles from publications across the world. It is extremely important for us to be able to put these stories written for digital media in our archive for the future. Many current content formats do not strive for rigorousness in this, instead tying the constraints of the format to the current platform of choice. When constructing this format, we chose to separate the original text from the data associated for this purpose.</blockquote>  <a href="https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipfs/bafybeigp5nuiey5wadfnj54nh2ioey4hmu5d4c2nizxqx6fzycy25jp7k4/2021-05-27%20Fission%20Atjson%20Talk%20Blaine%20Cook.pdf">PDF Slides »</a>  <p>Said perhaps a bit more succinctly, atJSON is designed to be a "100 year document format".</p> Jeremy Ruston, TiddlyWiki <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jermolene">Jeremy</a> showed some in progress work on transforming ePUB into <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> format for in browser annotation and linking, which you can try out online at <a href="https://twpub-tools.org/">twpub viewer</a>.</p><p>TiddlyWiki already supports multi formats, and using something like atJSON as an interchange format would allow for the ePUB code to be used by multiple projects. Maybe this is a <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/3">good starting point for some shared code</a>?</p>  Check out the GitHub for more info: <a href="https://github.com/TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools">TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools</a>   Gordon Brander, Subconscious <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gordonbrander">Gordon</a> is building a new tool for thought called <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/">Subconscious</a>, and walked us through the design of <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subtext-markup-for-note-taking">Subtext</a>, a new type of markup, designed for note taking.</p>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gordonbrander/subtext/">gordonbrander/subtext/</a>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y58oa44sWowFU9_XZa9tqKLTpWrHxF7GYNg2Xzc_e2w">Google Slides »</a>   Christina Bowen, Social Roots <p><a href="https://twitter.com/csageland">Christina Bowen</a> did an amazing job rounding out the presentations with a discussion about the usage of notes and note-taking tools for cross-group coordination and collaborative work to address social mess problems. Socialroots is a worker-owned platform cooperative, the first coop to receive funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Some organisations want to know lots about an individual, while others want to limit how much is known about them — as my colleague puts it, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">there are 1.4 billion people without an identity, but many more who are over identified</a>.</p><p>I find this a fascinating topic — it brings out the challenge of politics, power and control, which we’ve explored in our work on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27">digital identity ecosystem mapping,</a> such as in<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27"> Kenya</a>, and in our work supporting <a href="http://good-id.org/">the Good ID initiative</a>. So I was privileged to be invited to host a discussion on Digital Identity by the SIDA, the Swedish government’s development agency, as part of the <a href="https://stockholminternetforum.se/">Stockholm Internet Forum.</a> We brought together a diverse group of people from the digital identity industry, supporting Government digital identity in the Global North and the Global South, from the social protection sector, United Nations, civil society and academia.</p><p>We tackled diverse issues, such as the tension between inclusion and exclusion, noting that all identification systems <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0?t=2466">— digital or not — are predicated on inclusion and exclusion</a> and we need systems to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0?t=2582">One approach</a> discussed is forcing firms to proactively think about how they’re excluding people and to justify those exclusions upfront. And in the context of COVID-19, we talked about inclusion responses being high-coverage and timely but a key question: for whom? We still don’t know the toll of who’s been left out, but <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indonesias-invisible-people-face-discrimination-and-sometimes-death-by-database/">this article in Rest of World begins to explore that toll.</a> We also discussed the tensions between legal and stand-alone digital identity schemes, and between biometric data and privacy. There was a strong emphasis on trust, and a recognition that context is key to defining both trust and what constitutes ‘Good’ digital ID. It is a conversation that will continue so long as there are competing visions about the social contract between the identifier and identified. And there certainly are competing visions: watch the full recording below.</p><p>For more information, please <a href="https://claudiommachado.medium.com/good-digital-id-at-the-stockholm-internet-forum-sif-81a337d350e3">do read one of the participants own reflections</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0">watch the recording of the session&nbsp;here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/what-does-good-digital-identification-look-like-b8af547aebd8">What does ‘Good’ Digital Identification look like?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   By: Research Team at Caribou Digital, in collaboration with Qhala, University of Ghana, Lagos Business School and Value for&nbsp;Women  In Kenya, the COVID-19 pandemic meant the genesis of new business lines, especially for home supplies and deliveries, and the slowed growth or shutdown of some businesses for luxury goods and travel. This ultimately impacted people’s livelihoods, especially women.

So what can we learn from the stories women have to tell of their experience? <p>How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact a woman who delivers homemade food through WhatsApp orders in Nairobi? How did a female freelancer on Upwork in Lagos juggle her workload?</p><p>We’re excited to share that, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, Caribou Digital is kicking off a year-long research project on the lives and livelihoods of young female platform workers and sellers in Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria through and beyond the pandemic.</p><p>This gender lens is part of our broader and continuing work on platforms through which we’ve explored the real lives behind platforms (<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">Platform Livelihoods</a>), including our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">diagnostic discussions</a> and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling</a>.</p><p>We’ve put together a great group of research partners following a comprehensive selection process who we’re excited to work&nbsp;with:</p>  <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala </a>in&nbsp;Kenya  <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">the University of&nbsp;Ghana</a>  <a href="https://www.lbs.edu.ng/">Lagos Business School</a> and <a href="https://v4w.org/">Value for Women</a> in&nbsp;Nigeria  <p>This research will be conducted sequentially in Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria, in each case with a landscape review and expert interviews, as well as focus groups and interviews with female workers from different types of platform-related work. Each research team will also deploy a survey or social media scraping of keywords and discussions that arise in workers and sellers groups. Through interviews and participatory video storytelling, young women will tell their story in their own words, in partnership with<a href="https://www.storyby.design/"> Story x Design</a>, a multimedia production company based in&nbsp;Nairobi.</p>A screenshot of the female respondents from our previous video storytelling project<p>At Caribou Digital, we see <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">platform livelihoods</a> as more than just earning an income — a livelihood encompasses other factors including growth of the individual, their safety, the support they need and get, and whether they find purpose in their work as they navigate this new way of working. In <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">earlier work</a>, we defined platform livelihoods as how people rely on “digital platforms” to make money as workers (in the gig economy) or sellers (in e-commerce and social commerce). As we’ve seen in our research so far, livelihoods are constantly being negotiated between workers and platform owners, through digital means, including algorithmic interaction. As a demographic who may face barriers to participation, we were especially curious to understand the challenges that young women face, and how we can make platform livelihoods better for&nbsp;them.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">gender lens on platform work</a> often surfaces structural barriers such as lack of access to capital or infrastructure, or varying levels of digital skills. It also questions the notion of flexibility, as childcare places additional constraints on women’s time compared to men, as <a href="https://odi.org/en/publications/women-in-the-gig-economy-paid-work-care-and-flexibility-in-kenya-and-south-africa/">an ODI study found in Kenya and South Africa</a> found. Our new project investigates how COVID-19 impacts these existing challenges.</p><p>The gender lens will also help capture how unconscious biases and prejudices (for example, that a woman shouldn’t be driving) become obvious tangible barriers for women wanting to enter platform work on a ride-hailing app (the woman is denied a loan for a vehicle to drive for work). We’ll apply and explore Andrea Cornwall’s work on the levers of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3210">empowerment</a>, seen as a combination of “individual change, institutional or social change, informal and formal practices.” This might nuance the discussion from “women use cheaper phones and therefore we should build platforms for cheaper phones” to why women use cheaper phones and how that can be addressed. This research will also provide insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted such norms, from unconscious biases and prejudices to tangible&nbsp;biases.</p>Dathive is one of only two female motorcycle drivers on the Safeboda app in Uganda (<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">from our previous video storytelling project</a>)<p>Finally, we use the word “we” in the research question: “how can we make platform livelihoods better for young women”? But who is the “we”? The research asks exactly that — who is the “we” that needs to <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">make the platform work better for women</a>? Is it the platforms themselves? Is it female workers who might demand better conditions through women’s rights groups and activists? Is it policymakers like foundations and governments? And, related, how do we define “better”?</p><p>As we progress through the research, we’ll keep blogging and sharing the emerging themes on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cariboudigital">@cariboudigital</a>) and here on Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a>).

<p>I got the idea of breadboards from Ryan Singer in his book <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the field of electrical engineering, a breadboard is a fully functioning prototype without the industrial design. We can do the same for an interaction idea and choose not to specify any visual design.</p>
<p>To do this we specify three things:</p>
 
 Places — Things you can navigate to, like screens, modals etc. 
 Afforandances — Things users can act on, like buttons, menus but also interface copy. 
 Connection Lines — These show how affordances take users to different places. 
 
<p>Places go on top, affordances go underneath, connections define the flow.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  











  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>By staying in low-fidelity, the breadboarding and fat marker sketching leave room for designers later in the process.</p>
 The problem 
<p>One problem with breadboards is that the connection lines can get messy.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>A slightly different approach is using a <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a> board and using its ability to link to objects. Clicking on a link will move the current view to the linked object.</p>
<p>Because Miro zooms into the object that was linked, once you click a link, it can be helpful to link to a frame around the place/location in the breadboard. That way you never zoom in too far.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>Here's a animated gif of how it works in practice.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated housing issues across the world, drawing attention to the challenges of access, sustainability, and public health and wellbeing. Each city is tackling its own set of location-specific obstacles that intersect with global forces in different ways.</p>



<p>On the plus side, the situation has sped-up digitisation and ushered in long-overdue changes that improve efficiency, help democratise access to housing and boost sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how can governments, citizens and landlords of all types harness these opportunities and collaborate to shape housing of the future so that it works for everyone, everywhere? We take a look at some of the challenges highlighted by the pandemic, and a selection of exciting initiatives being pioneered to address them.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Addressing supply 



<p>As digitisation gathers pace, the power of data is being used across the world by forward-thinking policymakers to improve housing outcomes. In the UK, local and national governments are employing AI-powered geospatial technology that uses big data to map and analyze urban land, revealing its development potential for a range of use cases. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2020/10/29/geospatial-technology-could-solve-the-uk-housing-crisis/">According to Forbes</a>, “Supporting the UK government’s need to build efficient housing, organizations such as LandClan and Esri use this technology to identify the right living and working environments, helping facilitate building plans that take into account the best outcomes for residents, developers and investors alike.</p>



<blockquote><p>Catalyzed by the Covid-19 crisis, the construction industry is leveraging technology to address key inefficiencies – and passing savings on to buyers and renters.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/here-s-how-smart-construction-could-transform-home-building-after-covid-19/">Catalyzed by the Covid-19 crisis</a>, which limits the number of workers allowed on site and extends the completion time of projects, the construction industry is leveraging technology to address key inefficiencies – and passing savings on to buyers and renters. Building Information Modelling, for example, has seen more widespread uptake in the past year, allowing stakeholders to meet virtually and share data across disciplines, significantly speeding up the process at the design phase. At the same time, artificial intelligence is being <a href="https://fluxus-prefab.com/fluxhouse-generative/">used to assess</a> things like cost and locale in a virtual environment – massively speeding up the decision-making process at an early stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, technology developments like <a href="https://3dprintedhouse.nl/en/project-info/project-milestone/">3D printing are being used</a> to support faster, cheaper, more environmentally friendly methods of construction.</p>



 2. Empowering citizens and community&nbsp; 



<p>Initiatives to <a href="https://www.mobie.org.uk/">engage the community in housing development</a> existed already, but the onset of the pandemic prompted government, industry and citizens to collaborate in unprecedented ways. Across Europe, events like <a href="https://wirvsvirus.org/">Wir vs Virus</a> and <a href="https://theglobalhack.com/">The Global Hack</a> were set up to tap into the collective insights and expertise from different parts of the community to address emerging shortfalls in urban and community infrastructure. Last year, Housing 2020, Europe’s largest housing festival, hosted a <a href="https://cihhousing.com/virtual-festival-hackathon/virtual-festival-hackathon/climate-change-hackathon">climate change hackathon</a> to spark ideas to engage, educate and motivate the entire housing sector to adopt a climate emergency approach to all their decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The onset of the pandemic prompted government, industry and citizens to collaborate in unprecedented ways.</p></blockquote>



<p>Covid restrictions, including social distancing and lockdowns, also saw <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coliving-insights-no2-here-stay-lachlan-sloan/">loneliness skyrocket</a>. Yet, despite the challenges of living in large groups during a pandemic, many <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201208-how-communal-living-groups-are-riding-out-the-pandemic">intentional communities</a> and <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/how-has-covid-19-changed-proptech-and-how-are-startups-fighting-back/">co-living spaces</a> have thrived – with residents enjoying a heightened <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coliving-insights-no2-here-stay-lachlan-sloan/">sense of community and wellbeing</a> while retaining access to <a href="https://www.ic.org/intentional-communities-fared-pandemic/">reliable digital resources</a>.</p>



 3. 100% digital rental process 



<p>Perhaps the most significant impact in the last 12 months has been the accelerated push for the real estate industry to be more digital. Digital contracts are starting to become the norm, with Vonovia, one of Germany’s largest housing companies, recently introducing <a href="https://presse.vonovia.de/de-de/aktuelles/210421-digitaler-mietvertrag-kunden-app">digital lease signing</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bureaucracy is a major hurdle for renters and landlords alike. Real estate agencies have tended to <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/how-has-covid-19-changed-proptech-and-how-are-startups-fighting-back/">work mostly offline</a>, dealing with piles of paperwork and in-person meetings. For renters, applying for a home can be a major upheaval, especially for new arrivals, freelancers and those with non-traditional forms of income. At the same time, landlords and property managers are sometimes unable to access suitable tenants due to communication issues and data privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digitisation provides an opportunity for the industry to address legacy issues and recognise the realities of renting in the 21st century. They can better respond to customer demand for digital end-to-end processes, and select tenants efficiently while accommodating a diversity of applicant backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Digitisation provides an opportunity for the industry to address legacy issues and recognise the realities of renting in the 21st century.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> is using a cutting-edge, decentralised technology called self-sovereign identity (SSI) to provide a unique solution. Their digital passport allows users to own and control their own data, and provides a verifiable and transparent way for individuals, companies and governments to exchange private information. Potential renters can share only the data that’s relevant, while proving their income and other essential details that landlords require. Landlords and property managers get peace of mind through access to relevant information about their tenants, while guaranteeing data privacy and digitally managing contracts and tenant relationships.&nbsp;</p>

 Audi trusts in IDnow platform for new mobility concept „Audi on demand Subscribe“ 
<p>Munich, June 1st 2021, IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service provider for identity verification, supports the international automotive company AUDI AG with a digital solution for identity verification for the new subscription offer “Audi on demand Subscribe”.</p>
<p>In mid-May, the fully integrated subscription model<a href="https://audiondemand.de/subscribe/"> “Audi on demand Subscribe”</a> was launched in the first dealerships of the brand with the four rings in Germany. Customers can use it to digitally rent an Audi for a period of four to twelve months. For Audi, the focus is on flexibility and convenience for the user. In order to offer customers a fast and smooth process that fits in with the digital strategy, Audi relies on IDnow’s AutoIdent. In this process, the customer’s ID and driving license data are automatically read in a user-friendly process and checked for authenticity with the help of AI and machine learning technologies.</p>
<p>“For us, the focus is on the customers and their customer journey. When designing the subscription model, it was particularly important to us to integrate a fast and completely digital process for identity verification – this is what our target group expects. We are pleased to be working with IDnow and to be able to offer our customers this smooth process,” says Martin Wallenborn, Head of Business Development Sales Germany at AUDI AG. With “Audi on demand Subscribe”, the automobile group is supplementing its previous “Audi on demand Rent” offer, which enables short-term rentals of up to 28 days.</p>
<p>“With its subscription offer, Audi has created a service that needs a convenient and fast application route. Our team has come up with a great solution that fits exactly the requirements of the Audi brand and its customers,” says Oliver Obitayo, Chief Sales Officer at IDnow.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its capabilities in recent years far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers of online and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe.</p>

<p>The excitement that accompanied the recent pilot concert in Liverpool showed that after enduring 14 months of lockdown, the UK public has been craving the return of music and good times. This is further supported by a <a href="https://www.festicket.com/magazine/news/roadmap-out-of-lockdown-survey-over-90-of-uk-festival-goers-feel-confident-attending-a-live-event-th/">survey of music fans</a>, which found that 90% of the 140,000 people polled feel confident to attend a live festival this year. However, with potential issues around Covid safety, cancellation insurance, customer experience, ticket touts and data breaches hanging over organisers in this new post-Covid world, it’s clear that new solutions are needed if the summer festival season is going to be successful.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">Government having so far fa</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">iled to put cancellation insurance in place for festival organisers</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">no official guidance having yet been published for mass gatherings</a> after June 21st, to say that festival organisers are nervous would be a gross understatement. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/04/more-than-a-quarter-of-uk-music-festivals-cancelled-over-insurance-fears">Glastonbury and Download are among some of the big names to have cancelled so far</a> – in what should have been the year where glorious live events returned triumphantly.</p>
<p>It’s really no surprise to see some festival organisers decide that staging an event simply isn’t worth the risk. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984501/S1235_Eighty-eighth_SAGE_meeting.pdf">Sage’s latest minutes</a>, from its meeting on 5th May 2021, predict that any new Covid variant that is highly transmissible or that substantially escapes immunity could lead to a “very significant wave of infections”.</p>
<p> With the average cost of staging an independent festival coming in at a whopping £6 million, the recent AIF member survey – which showed that almost 93% of respondents do not plan on staging their events without some form of government-backed insurance or indemnity scheme – makes perfect sense as organisers won’t want to risk forking out on events that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/festival-insurance-remains-single-biggest-worry-as-government-is-urged-to-back-up-events-2924299">could yet be cancelled by the Government</a> if there’s another spike.</p>
<p>Greater Responsibility for safety</p>
<p>This year, the responsibility organisers have for the safety of their attendees is far greater than ever. Now, on top of their previous safety protocols they will need to think about things like minimising Covid infection risk and protecting valuable personal health data.</p>
<p>Over the last 14 months, enforcing social distancing has become a key responsibility for venue owners who are dedicated to keeping patrons safe – but at a festival this will be nigh on impossible. Add packed mosh pits and inhibition-reducing alcohol to the mix and any chance of distance diminishes even further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If people already infected with Covid are allowed entry into a festival, there is a real risk of creating a Covid hotspot. This, of course, would be incredibly damaging for organisers, whose reputation would come under fire and it&nbsp;could lead to the closure of future festivals – which would damage confidence in the industry. It is because of this that organisers will need to combine testing and technology to ensure only people who are attested Covid safe; either through a negative test or fully immunised, are granted entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart technology to avoid irritating queues</p>
<p>Festival organisers will also need to do better at managing delays than other sectors. In recent weeks, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56743571">Heathrow airport reporting delays of up to six hours</a>. This would be catastrophic at a festival – to keep festival goers waiting, after they have already waited for months to have a great time, would only lead to frustration and likely cause a bad reputation for the festival itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To minimise this and to prevent the&nbsp;risk of infected people trying to gain entry to the festival onsite – which would pose another safety risk – organisers should look to the combination of testing and technology to allow people to capture their Covid status in advance and demonstrate they meet protocols through a private and secure digital health pass.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to ticket touts</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/25/parasitic-ticket-touts-undermining-music-festivals-covid-tracing">Reports have revealed that ticket touts </a>are taking advantage of the Covid situation and pent up demand to really rip-off consumers.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sharonhodgson.org/ticket_touts_campaign">Labour MP, Sharon Hodgson</a>, has rightly called for the Government – which has itself been promising to ‘Build Back Better’ – to use this opportunity to introduce measures that make events Covid secure and stop ticket touts from deceiving customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Digital IDs are the answer to this. Implemented effectively, this system allows festival organisers to provide customers with a completely private digital ID wallet, where they can also store their entry ticket and Covid status as part of a slick entry process that would instantly make ticket touts a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Keeping personal and health data completely safe</p>
<p>Medical data is at least <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/nhs-cyber-attack-medical-data-records-stolen-why-so-valuable-sell-financial-a7733171.html">10 times more valuable than financial data on the dark web</a> so any record that is made of individuals’ Covid status by festival organisers needs to be watertight. Over recent years, numerous music festivals have reported major data breaches. In 2014, Belgian festival <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach-compromises-64000-tomorrowland-festival-attendees/">Tomorrowland saw a data breach</a> involving the information of 64,000 festival-goers and, in 2017, details of nearly <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/data-leakage/28259/1-million-coachella-festival-goers-hacked">one million Coachella attendees were leaked</a> from its database. Closer to home, only last year, industry giant <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873">Ticketmaster was fined £1.25m for failing to keep their customers’&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873">personal data secure</a> following a cyber attack on the website in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These instances demonstrate that the data threat is all too real. Add Covid data into the mix though, and the risk becomes even greater.</p>
<p>This is another way that a digital health pass based on Self-Sovereign ID can help. Whereas most data breaches are the result of centralised databases being hacked, with SSID, an individual’s personal data is stored on their individual phone and is never seen or accessed by anyone else. It is as secure as it is possible to be and removes the responsibility from the event organiser for processing their customer’s data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future of safe festivals awaits</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see live music get back on track with the pilot event at Liverpool but it’s unclear how this system will scale if expanded from the 3,000 attendees at that event to the more than 100,000 who visit some of the UK’s biggest festivals, nor indeed is it clear how it will work when numerous events are happening all over the country at around the same time.</p>
<p>That’s why many festival organisers will rightly remain concerned about issues such as Covid safety, cancellation insurance, customer experience, ticket touts and data breaches – and will know that they need to take action themselves to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>The answer to all of these problems lies in the combination of a smart implementation of testing and technology. At BLOK BioScience, we are helping our partners to deliver testing on a large scale and using our unique Self-Sovereign ID technology-based digital health pass – which is the only health pass in the world to be certified by the ID2020 – to enable event organisers to provide visitors with a completely secure and private record of their Covid status.</p>
<p>Our flexible system is completely interoperable, meaning that it can plug into a festival’s existing systems, and can allow customers to store their digital ID, Covid status and festival ticket all on one device. The system enables super-fast entry as visitors use their BLOK Pass to prove they meet the entry criteria in less than 30 seconds, with a green QR code granting them access, amber meaning they need to take a test and red illustrating they are a potential Covid risk. It’s delivered by security and customer service teams via the super-easy BLOK Verify app, which sits on their mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are planning an event this year then a system like this could be the key to you providing a safe environment that protects the health and the data of your customers, that ensures a smooth entry system and minimal queues and that completely eradicates the ticket tout problem. All of this will boost the reputation of your event and could even protect your festival from being closed if there is a spike in infections between now and the event – as you can prove you have robust safety measures in place.

For individuals, identity is biometric information, a unique number such as a driver’s license number, etc. However, the key aspect is that this information must be owned solely by that&nbsp;entity.</p> What is Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">SSI</a> is a digital movement that aims to enable individuals or organizations to have sole ownership of their identity, and to have control over how their data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials (VCs)? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">Verifiable credentials</a>, or VCs in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.  <p>Here’s how a VC looks&nbsp;like</p> {<br>  // set the context, which establishes the special terms we will be using<br>  // such as 'issuer' and 'alumniOf'.<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>": [<br>    "<a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1</a>"<br>  ],<br>  // specify the identifier for the credential<br>  "id": "<a href="http://example.edu/credentials/1872">http://example.edu/credentials/1872</a>",<br>  // the credential types, which declare what data to expect in the credential<br>  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "AlumniCredential"],<br>  // the entity that issued the credential<br>  "issuer": "<a href="https://example.edu/issuers/565049">https://example.edu/issuers/565049</a>",<br>  // when the credential was issued<br>  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",<br>  // claims about the subjects of the credential<br>  "credentialSubject": {<br>    // identifier for the only subject of the credential<br>    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",<br>    // assertion about the only subject of the credential<br>    "alumniOf": {<br>      "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",<br>      "name": [{<br>        "value": "Example University",<br>        "lang": "en"<br>      }, {<br>        "value": "Exemple d'Université",<br>        "lang": "fr"<br>      }]<br>    }<br>  },<br>  // digital proof that makes the credential tamper-evident<br>  // see the NOTE at end of this section for more detail<br>  "proof": {<br>    // the cryptographic signature suite that was used to generate the signature<br>    "type": "RsaSignature2018",<br>    // the date the signature was created<br>    "created": "2017-06-18T21:19:10Z",<br>    // purpose of this proof<br>    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",<br>    // the identifier of the public key that can verify the signature<br>    "verificationMethod": "<a href="https://example.edu/issuers/keys/1">https://example.edu/issuers/keys/1</a>",<br>    // the digital signature value<br>    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..TCYt5X<br>      sITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVkIEq_PbChOMqsLfRoPsnsgw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgRxD-WUc<br>      X16dUEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qktb3rk-BuQy72IFLOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPN25DGlcTwLtj<br>      PAYuNzVBAh4vGHSrQyHUdBBPM"<br> }<br> } <p>Who are Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers in a Verifiable Credential?</p><p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, startups, etc.</p><p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p> What’s the Difference Between a Verifiable Credential and a Verifiable Claim? <p>At the basic level, a claim is a statement. A claim becomes a credential when it is verifiable and backed by evidence.</p><p>In the digital identity world, a verifiable claim is a piece of information about the subject, and these are made by an issuer. To become a credential, each of these claims must be verifiable in some&nbsp;way.</p><p>Specifically, the verifier must be able to ascertain the following.</p>  Who issued the credential?  That the credential has not been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued  That the credential has not expired or been&nbsp;revoked   How to Verify a Credential? <p>With physical credentials, this is accomplished through some proof of authenticity embedded directly in the credential itself like a chip or hologram. It can also be done by checking directly with the issuer that the credential is valid, accurate, and current. But this manual verification process can be difficult and time-consuming — a major reason why there is a worldwide black market in falsified credentials.</p><p>This brings us to one of the fundamental advantages of verifiable credentials: using cryptography and the Internet, they can be digitally verified in seconds. This verification process can answer the following four questions:</p>  Is the credential in a standard format and does it contain the data the verifier&nbsp;needs?  Does it include a valid digital signature from the&nbsp;issuer?  Is the credential still valid, that is, not expired or&nbsp;revoked?  If applicable, does the credential (or its signature) provide cryptographic proof that the holder of the credential is the subject of the credential?  <p>(Credits to the book “Self-sovereign identity“ for this explanation)</p> What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)? <p>A basic building block of SSI is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. These are a type of unique identifiers (URI) that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>These DIDs come with certain properties and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Does not require a centralized registration authority  Many DIDs use the distributed ledger technology or any other decentralized network, though it is not mandatory  It is a permanent identifier because it does not depend on a single third-party or centralized registry for its existence.  Can be cryptographically verified  They connect a DID subject (the entity identified by the DID) with a DID document (a set of data that describes the DID subject) to enable the subject to have trustable interactions.  They are interoperable and portable, provided they conform to the existing standards laid down by&nbsp;W3C   What is a DID Document? <p>A DID document is a JSON-LD object that contains a set of data that describes the DID subject including the cryptographic signatures, verification methods, or just about anything that will enable the DID subject to have trustable interactions with other entities on the&nbsp;network.</p> What is a DID Resolution? <p>DID resolution is the process of getting from a DID to its DID Document. It is analogous to the resolution of DNS name to IP&nbsp;address</p><p>DID Document contains metadata of a DID subject. It contains the minimum amount of information to connect with the DID subject. The key information contained in a DID document is public keys, service endpoints, and authentication methods.</p> What is a DID&nbsp;Method? <p>DID methods are the component that helps a DID to resolve a DID document. It defines how DID documents are created, read, updated, and deleted on a&nbsp;network.</p><p>DID methods are often associated with a verifiable data registry, which is a system that brings together DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods. Some examples of verifiable data registries are trusted databases, decentralized databases, distributed ledger, and government ID databases like DigiLocker. Sometimes, more than one type of registry can be used in the same ecosystem.</p><p>A DID document looks like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>": [<br>    "<a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1">https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1">https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1</a>"<br>  ]<br>  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br>  "authentication": [{<br>    // used to authenticate as did:...fghi<br>    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",<br>    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",<br>    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br>    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"<br>  }]<br>} <p>In terms of implementation, a DID method is defined by its specification that precisely defines how DIDs and DID documents are created, updated, deactivated, and resolved.</p> What is a Sidetree Protocol? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">Sidetree protocol</a> is an open blockchain-agnostic protocol developed by DIF and supported by Microsoft. The core idea of this protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protocol is designed to overcome many technical problems in existing implementations that include high throughput and cost, presence of centralized authorities, lack of scalability, and more. The Sidetree protocol bridges the need for a decentralized and open protocol as it batches together JSON (a standard for representing structured data) operations to lower the associated costs, improve throughput, enhance scalability, and at the same, allow these operations to be anchored to any decentralized identity&nbsp;network.</p><p>It also helps to create unique identifiers that are controlled and managed by users with their public key infrastructure. Further, it conforms to the W3C specifications, so developers can use the decentralized identifier (DID)&nbsp;methods.</p> What are Peer&nbsp;DIDs? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">Peer DIDs</a> are implemented as a direct interaction between the two parties to a transaction.</p><p>The way that two entities interact with each other directly without involving a network is the core principle of peer DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The idea behind creating these peer DID methods is to ensure a cheap, fast, secure, and scalable way to create and maintain private relationships between two entities. Let’s say, Alice and Bob are two entities who are interacting with each other, so only both of them care about the transaction and have a need to resolve their respective DIDs.</p> What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs? <p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> is a cryptographic protocol where one entity can prove its identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p><p>When you say that an entity has an identity, what you mean is that the entity has a series of claims that are used to uniquely identify it. Breaking it down further, we can say that this process comprises of two&nbsp;steps,</p>  Creating a claim, where each claim is a subset that contributes to making an individual unique. Some examples of claims are date of birth, passport number, driver’s license, Social Security Number, or any other government-ID that belongs only to an entity and can be used solely to identify&nbsp;it.  Proving the claim — A means by which this claim is proven without the actual information.   What is&nbsp;IPFS? <p>InterPlanterary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing files and tracking their versions in a distributed file system. It works by connecting all devices on a network to the same file system, and each file in it is identified by a unique crypto hash of its contents.</p> What are BBS+ Signatures? <p>The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signature</a> scheme is a Digital Signature Scheme (DSS) with two distinct parties, namely, the signer and the signature holder. Here the signature holder is the owner of a signature while the signer is the entity authenticating that the signature belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>It is based on Pedersen commitment, a scheme that allows a sender to commit to a secret value that can be revealed in the future. Until then, the sender transmits a commitment to preserve the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>This commitment is the connecting aspect between the signature holder and the signer, and the contents are blinded until the holder decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, these signatures give complete control to the holder to decide when and what must be revealed, and follow the principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) where the holder can prove the required identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p> What is a Custodial Wallet? <p>In the context of a decentralized wallet, having private keys means that you have full control over the contents of your wallet. A decentralized wallet may be capable of holding your crypto funds or holding your digital identity, typically on your hardware (i.e. no central servers CRUDing your data). However, many people are not acquainted with digital wallet, blockchain technology, and the concept of public-private keys. A Custodial Wallet is defined as a wallet in which the private keys are held by a third party. Meaning, the third party has full control over the contents of your wallet while you only have to permit CRUD operations on wallet contents. That way you don’t have to worry about losing your private&nbsp;key.</p> What is&nbsp;PKI? <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a>, or PKI in short, is a cryptographic system that consists of a key pair, one private and the other public. Both these keys work in tandem and are used for encrypting data and sharing it with others, so the contents can be seen only by the intended recipient.</p><p>Let’s understand how it works with an example. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she encrypts the message with Bob’s public key and sends it. In turn, Bob uses his private key that’s associated with the public key to decrypt and read the&nbsp;message.</p> What is a Verifiable Presentation? <p>A verifiable presentation is the collation of credentials that a holder wants to share with a verifier.</p><p>A holder can get signed credentials from different issuers and store them in the digital wallet. When the holder wants to share a set of credentials, they are collated into a presentation, and this is shared with the verifier.</p> What is&nbsp;SSIaaS? <p>SSI as a service is what Affinidi’s core aims to build for our applications. An application (i.e. an organization, a developer) that wishes to leverage SSI principles for their users’ identity can currently consume our SDK methods. The idea is to enable applications to do things like DID creation, VC sharing, etc. via API endpoints i.e.&nbsp;SSIaaS</p><p>To learn more about what we do, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.

 Ocean Protocol works with Raven Protocol to add Federated Learning to Ocean Market via Compute-to-Data <p>Ocean democratizes access to datasets and AI while Raven’s decentralized algorithms allow cost-efficient training of neural&nbsp;networks</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is partnering with <a href="https://www.ravenprotocol.com/">Raven Protocol</a>, a decentralized and distributed deep-learning training protocol providing cost-efficient training of deep neural networks.</p><p>Raven will become a Compute Provider on <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, publishing a range of algorithms from Machine Learning to Federated Analytics and Federated Learning. <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a> on Ocean Market resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it to get useful compute results like averaging or building an AI&nbsp;model.</p><blockquote>AI is at the heart of what Ocean Protocol does, so we’re very excited by this partnership. Ocean’s mission is to democratize access to data sets and AI capabilities; this aligns perfectly with Raven’s mission to provide cost-efficient and faster training of deep neural networks using a decentralized and distributed network of compute nodes. Together we are one step closer to unlocking the Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</blockquote><blockquote>— Razvan Olteanu, Chief Operating Officer at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Ethically handling the privacy and security of AI training data has been a priority for Raven, who have been working on integrating various encryption techniques into their protocol. Compute-to-Data on Ocean Market fits this need perfectly:</p>  First, Data Publishers approve AI algorithms to run on their data. These algorithms could be published by Raven Protocol or other third&nbsp;parties.  Then, Compute-to-Data orchestrates remote computation and execution on data to train AI models. The remote computation could be handled by the Raven Network or other Compute Providers approved by the Data Publisher.  <p>In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on, for example, AWS or Azure in the background. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end users. While this is an incredible feat in itself, users and Data Publishers may want an alternative option in the Compute Providers they choose to approve. The spirit of decentralization may be a philosophical choice for some, but a strict requirement for others. Raven Protocol provides the decentralized option when choosing a Compute Provider.</p><p>On top of that, Raven provides an additional layer of privacy for Ocean Compute-to-Data. Raven Protocol could publish, for example, a Federated Learning algorithm. When run, a neural network is randomly initialized. Weight updates are computed next to the data itself in a data silo and then sent to the neural network. This is repeated in data silo #1, data silo #2, data silo #3, and so on. A neural network gets trained across many data silos without data leaving the premises of each respective silo. The <a href="https://www.github.com/ravenprotocol">Raven Distribution Framework</a> enables this in Compute-to-Data.</p><blockquote>At Raven, we believe that distributed computing is the future of computing. Our framework RDF is a distributed and decentralised compute engine, consisting of various libraries like RavOp, RavML and RavDL. As we are inching towards our goal, our partnership with Ocean is going to be a powerful collaboration providing value to our contributors, Ocean’s data-providers and clients. We are super excited to be working with Ocean’s&nbsp;team.</blockquote><blockquote>— Kailash Ahirwar, Co-founder of Raven Protocol and author of <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Projects">Generative Adversarial Networks Projects: Build next-generation generative models using TensorFlow and&nbsp;Keras</a></blockquote> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

<p>In this post, we explore recent trends in data regulation and discuss their implications for businesses at large, with a particular emphasis on the ASEAN region. In addition, we outline how businesses can utilise Credify’s suite of products to facilitate compliance with these regulations and — importantly — monetise their data in a lawful manner.</p>



<p>Sound too good to be true? Read on!</p>



 Data Protection Is Trending 



<p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018 and introduced a comprehensive, harmonised data protection regime. With limited exceptions, the regime applies to all data processing entities that deal with individuals in the EU, regardless of where they are based. As such, ASEAN businesses need to also familiarise themselves with the GDPR’s implications.</p>



<p>The GDPR contains a suite of rights designed to place consumers at the helm. As we have mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/credify-mission-statement-products-and-research-directions-aea975d26436">previous&nbsp;articles</a>, many businesses have sought to exploit users’ personal data by selling it off to third parties in an opaque manner. Social media platforms have engaged in particularly egregious instances of abuse, with the Cambridge Analytica scandal still looming large over our heads.</p>



<p>Amongst the GDPR’s most consequential rights are the following:</p>



  Lawfulness of processing&nbsp;(Article 6): the user needs to have consented to the types of processing that the business will undertake (including transfers of user data to third parties).  Right of access&nbsp;(Article 15): this requires businesses to provide users with a copy of the personal data that they hold upon request.  Right to erasure&nbsp;(Article 17): users can request that their personal data be completely erased from a businesses’ systems, unless this needs to be kept for regulatory purposes.  Right to data portability&nbsp;(Article 20):users have the right to request that their data be transferred from one service provider to another.  



Key principles underpinning the GDPR



<p>Note that the GDPR requires businesses to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;these actions, as opposed to being mere bystanders. The fines for business that process personal data and do not comply with the GDPR can reach €20 million or 4% of global turnover (whichever is greatest!).</p>



<p>Although these fines may seem unnecessary punitive, they reflect the seriousness with which regulators are taking data processing activities. After all, many people spend the bulk of their working hours in front of a laptop, generating a greater footprint in the digital economy than in the tangible world. Regulators view personal data as a valuable form of personal property, no different than our tangible possessions. Consequently, unauthorised activities by data processing businesses are regarded as forms of data abuse or identity theft.</p>



 Strengthening Local Regulations 



<p>businesses need to act upon. There are, of course, local regulations that also come into play when dealing with users in specific geographies. Nonetheless, the GDPR is influencing the development of these regimes, pushing regulators towards a more comprehensive and consumer-centric model.</p>



<p>Vietnam is the perfect example to highlight this trend. At present, the country’s data protection regime is highly fragmented. Data protection laws are spread across 50 legal instruments on diverse subject matters, which hinders consistency and interpretability (to the detriment of both businesses and consumers). [1]</p>



<p>To address this situation, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security has presented a draft decree that aims to lay down a unified and extensive set of data protection rules. Many provisions in the decree mirror those of the GDPR, such as the need to process data within the boundaries of users’ consent and to notify users of activities involving their personal data. [2]</p>



<p>Singapore is in the process of updating their data protection regime, while Indonesia is in the process of finalising comprehensive data protection legislation (scheduled for November 2020). [3] We expect other countries in the ASEAN region to revamp their local regulations too. So far, Japan is the only neighbouring nation to have been granted GDPR-adequacy status by the European Commission, confirming the compatibility of their respective data protection regimes. [4]</p>



The World Federation of Advertisers maintains a helpful privacy map



 The Comply Advantage 



<p>Now is the time for businesses to evaluate their data management processes and consider whether sufficient protections are being afforded to their customers. The failure to do so can leave businesses liable to not only regulatory sanctions, but also exposed to the potential loss of customers. As a result of this regulatory shift, consumers will increasingly demand that their data be handled in a lawful and transparent manner. On that basis, data management strategies should be at the forefront of businesses’ minds.</p>



<p>If you’ve come across our previous articles, you may already be aware of work that we’re pursuing at Credify (see e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/credify-mission-statement-products-and-research-directions-aea975d26436">here</a>&nbsp;for an outline of our products). We think that Credify can be the perfect partner for businesses looking to undertake this regulatory transition. Credify’s business model is grounded on the need to provide consumers with greater control over their data. As such, its products respect the principles enshrined in regulations like the GDPR, facilitating the data management process in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>



<p>In particular, Credify’s idX system enables businesses to associate personal data with individual user accounts. Through Credify’s idPass application, users can monitor the personal data that each business is holding and track how their data is being used in an auditable log. The application also allows users to check whether their personal data is up to date; everyone hates correspondence that is sent to an old email or residential address. Importantly, businesses can obtain users’ consent for specific activities (such as sending data to an affiliate or commercial partner) through the idX system — a notification will appear on the idPass application and will record the users’ consent (or refusal) to the transfer.</p>



<p>Credify’s solution is privacy-centric, since Credify’s ability to access users’ data is highly restricted. In fact, we are proud to be working with world-renowned cryptographers and technologists to provide users and businesses with strong security assurances. At present, Credify is using proven technical standards (such as Open ID Connect) and the latest auditing technologies (such as blockchain) to meet our privacy and security objectives.</p>



 Gaining An Edge 



<p>Although this wave of regulation may pose initial challenges, it will also open up new opportunities for forward-thinking players. Businesses can still adopt processes to monetise their user data and acquire data from other businesses, so long as users’ rights are fully respected.</p>



<p>As we hinted above, Credify’s tools can also be used to support a lawful monetisation strategy. Let’s imagine that a marketplace is willing to share a user’s data with an insurance company, which is looking to build a diverse profile about a potential client. The marketplace requests the specific user’s consent and, once accepted by said user through the idPass, Credify can open up a direct channel between the businesses to handle the transfer. In turn, the audit log will be updated to reflect this activity.</p>



<p>We&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/the-next-data-frontier-c6e6e6dc9c72">previously</a>&nbsp;introduced the concept of a data highway. To move data from one end-point to another, users are likely to ask for some sort of incentive (or “toll”). After all, their data is valuable and they are entitled to refuse the transfer if they so choose. Popular incentives can take the form of discounts or vouchers. In the example above, the insurance company may pass on savings attained in the due diligence process (as a result of the data transfer) in the form of lower premiums for participating users. We would also expect the insurance company to compensate the marketplace for each user that they are able to acquire. In short, every party is able to benefit from this transaction.</p>







 Summing up 



<p>We have provided a roadmap for the future of data regulations, with a focus on the ASEAN region. We encourage all businesses to start adapting to this regulatory shift, irrespective of how developed local data protection regimes currently are. This trend is set to strengthen in the coming years and there are significant risks to being caught off guard.</p>



<p>If you’re a business looking for a technological solution to these problems, as well as an avenue to monetise your data in a lawful manner, look no further. Credify has the tools that you need and is willing to work with you to facilitate your success.</p>



Which side of the road are you on?

<p>InsideBitcoins: ...Among Ignis’s unique selling points is its ability to run what it calls lightweight smart contracts, which means that not every node on the chain needs to be involved in computing and verifying the transactions. That makes smart contracts quicker to deploy and cheaper to run, especially compared to current market leader Ethereum.</p>

 How I built a decentralized marketing department powered by NFTs in just 13&nbsp;minutes Vive la Sybil resistance! The gift <p>In about 13 minutes we gonna create both an immense amount of value and a decentralized marketing department. A task impossible for a regular article. Thus this is not a regular one. This is the craziest and the sanest thing you’ve stumbled upon in the crypto space recently. Take a moment, relax and read&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Inspired by <a href="https://kernel.community/module-0/">Kernel modules</a> (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptowanderer">Andy</a>) that conclude with <a href="https://kernel.community/module-7/">the gift</a> — a beautiful article on&nbsp;giving.</blockquote><p>It all started with a gift. On March 14, 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah">The Officious BokkyPooBah</a>, a famous frog and fossil photographer (and Ethereum dev), <a href="https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah/status/1371096562089164807">gave away</a> a considerable number of <a href="https://mooncatrescue.com/">MoonCats</a> to Ethereum developers. Surprisingly enough, I had one&nbsp;too.</p><p>After that, I started to see MoonCats almost daily. A <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1372987465234059266">song</a>, an <a href="https://twitter.com/icebergy_/status/1372404295581188096">AR-kitten</a>, a kitten on a <a href="https://twitter.com/SprinklesNFT/status/1373015859254415362">tiny electronic photo frame</a>, kittens on avatars (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick.eth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness">Evan Van Ness</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/cybercodetwins/status/1372597926518657031">all</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Don_keyedjote/status/1373126907642793989">other</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KeramDesign/status/1371173184188383238">sorts</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1372776576731901952">stuff</a>. Some people are celebrating, some appreciating BokkyPooBah, paying back to him and paying forward (I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1375339243128639490">doughnut</a>), some are trying to increase the value of their own&nbsp;cats.</p><p>There’s definitely something here. Intentionally or not all cat owners are promoting the myth of cat rescue. As a consequence the average MoonCat price on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wrapped-mooncatsrescue">OpenSea</a> increases. The act of giving effectively created a marketing department for the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Kittens have no utility (yet). They are “just” collectibles that are first of their kind, a part of blockchain history, and widely recognized by the community. All the kittens have is a myth and they sell nothing but a&nbsp;myth.</p><p>What about projects that do have utility™️? Think of virtually any project in the blockchain space. They have mission, art, memes, they do super-novel stuff, they are first of their kind, they are widely recognized and they are building history. They have their own strong myths. But they usually call it “marketing” and use it to build relationships with customers and sell their product. They never sell their myths directly and usually pay to promote them. There’s probably a better way for&nbsp;them.</p> Non-fungible myths <p>Imagine you want to sell your utility-first project myths directly. You put price tags on logos, icons, article header images, community calls background, etc. You turn all those into NFTs. It may sound weird, but let’s explore&nbsp;further.</p><p>We gonna call those non-fungible myths or NFMs. Same standard, same functionality as NFTs, just a special case of it — myths and their part on sale. We’ll explore if it is possible to bootstrap an additional marketing department for your project with NFMs. We’ll see what it takes to create dynamics similar to the one of MoonCats and what benefits are there for you if you select this&nbsp;path.</p> Easy to&nbsp;try <p>Simplicity. It doesn’t require a lot of effort. The artifacts you need are already there — the ones already mentioned above, logos, icons, etc., plus memes, sketches, prototypes, tweets — a lot of work that is usually considered a byproduct. Just put a “verified” mark on them, wrap them as NFTs and you get some NFMs for a start. Byproduct becomes a product and can be monetized.</p><p>Monetization. Start selling NFMs and you get an additional source of income at almost no&nbsp;cost.</p><p>These are a couple of instant benefits of using NFMs. But really just the tip of the iceberg. There are many wonderful properties of NFMs (inherited from NFTs) that could be leveraged.</p> Self-promoting <p>NFMs are personal. Unlike ERC20 tokens, every NFM is perceived as an item, not a number. It does have an extrinsic (market) value, but also a story, relationship, affection, an intrinsic value.</p><blockquote>Would you prefer to have an Apple stock or the first iMac prototype?</blockquote><p>Every item's price is defined by its owner — not only the market. Every owner is thus incentivized to promote their own item, meaning to sell it in the future or just celebrate ownership.</p><blockquote>How many profiles with <a href="https://twitter.com/thepxlportraits">pixel-portrait</a> avatars do you follow on&nbsp;Twitter?</blockquote><p>And as we’ve seen with MoonCats, promoting a single item promotes the whole project’s mythology and adds value to it. Promotion happens naturally as every holder is a promoter. An NFM-powered project gets an additional promotion channel.</p> Welcoming <p>NFMs are viral. There’s always something to share, to show, to tinker with. Any item could be modified and the number of modifications is unlimited. Even the whole myth could be extended. Any medium works — Image, video, text, sound, and code (programming new mechanics). Any type and any level of skill can&nbsp;benefit.</p><blockquote>How many spin-offs (<a href="https://twitter.com/bganpunks">bastard gan punks</a>) and add-ons (<a href="https://twitter.com/punkbodies">bodies</a>) to <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs">cryptopunks</a> you’ve seen so&nbsp;far?</blockquote><p>Creators have incentives to collaborate as they are sharing the popularity of the project’s mythology. Same as owners promote their items, creators promote their modifications and spin-offs. Same as owners, they inevitably promote the original mythology (the project’s) and add value to it. An NFM-powered project naturally attracts contributors.</p> Anti-fragile <p>NFMs are self-sufficient. Let’s expand this one a bit more as we are approaching some really cool&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>The Sky Commuter flying car prototype from the 1990s was <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/flying-car-prototype-from-1990-going-up-for-auction-1678077004">sold on eBay for $130,000</a> and again <a href="https://barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/1990-CONCEPT-SKY-COMMUTER-AIRCRAFT--178603">here</a>. It has no antique value, the Sky Innovations company is dead and forgotten. What makes the prototype valuable is the myth of “flying cars”, which is still relevant today and will be relevant in the future. In relation to the company, this myth is a super-set myth — it includes the company’s mythology entirely. This myth is strong and lives on its own. Over time it keeps growing and keeps adding value to all the sub-myths and artifacts within&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Imagine if somebody puts the first mouse prototype by Xerox on auction. Would you be interested to have&nbsp;it?</blockquote><p>Similarly, NFMs get automatically attached to a super-set mythology, the one that is bigger than the project’s. Public goods, automated markets, future of work — these are all super-set myths, that a related project will passively attach to. And there’s always bonus fallback mythology — blockchain history.</p><p>These mythologies will live longer than most of the projects. And NFMs will belong to those myths forever. The stronger the mythology gets, the more valuable the artifacts within that mythology are.</p><p>Thus NFMs are antifragile. Unlike ERC20 tokens they don’t care where the market goes. They are almost insured from dropping to 0. And in the early days, there’s only one way for them — up and to the right. Holders/traders/creators understand that. Which creates an additional FOMO (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out#:~:text=Fear%20of%20missing%20out%20(FOMO,with%20what%20others%20are%20doing.)">definition on wiki</a> incentives for them. NFM-powered project passively acquires value over time by just being&nbsp;there.</p> Nobody is selling their&nbsp;myths <p>Creating non-fungible myths does not require a lot of effort. Project’s byproducts don’t have to be wasted anymore, all the little memes and all the big ones can be monetized. Putting a price tag on those creates strong incentives for anyone to expand the project’s mythology, buy into it, or just share it. Any of those actions increase mythology’s and project’s value.</p><p>This already does look like a marketing department. Owners, creators, traders being its dedicated employees. Marketing becomes diluted through NFMs in the same way as governance is being diluted through airdropped ERC20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf">EPNS project is issuing NFTs</a> to support their community. As well as <a href="https://app.chiev.net/community/0xdead">MetaGame</a>. <a href="https://badgerdao.medium.com/badger-to-launch-nft-themed-spaceships-with-the-cometh-defi-gaming-platform-7bcc0d325c8">Badger is minting starships</a> together with <a href="https://twitter.com/MUSTCometh">Cometh</a>. <a href="https://zora.co/syndicate/2195">Syndicate protocol</a> and <a href="https://zora.co/mochi">Mochi</a> are selling their NFTs to support development.</p><p>I couldn’t find other utility-first projects that sell NFTs and I found none that sell their myths (NFMs). I see it as an opportunity and gonna take some first-mover advantage for <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a>. In the next section. That would be insane. But before that let’s have a short talk on&nbsp;myths.</p> Super-set myths <p>We’ve seen how projects can make use of their existing myths by wrapping them into NFTs. And how those NFMs are then being auto-attached to its natural super-set myths. This is a kinda passive way to deal with myths. There’s probably a better way. What if we deliberately create our own super-set mythology?</p><p>Hm… But we’ve just discussed how easy it is to build a marketing department with NFMs. It may seem that we are about to diminish its benefits. Creating myths is what marketing departments do. And it requires a lot of&nbsp;effort.</p><p>True, but we can use a vastly underrated blockchain super-power to cut corners. We’ve seen how we can count on artists, buyers, holders, and other individuals that share value through NFMs. To build a myth from scratch we need even more help. For that, we need to share even&nbsp;more.</p><p>The super-power that we can use is synergy. We can create a super-set myth wide enough to include multiple project mythologies. If these projects would then acknowledge the myth, they’d have a shared value. Building the myth would be a much simpler&nbsp;task.</p><p>Synergy is often explained as 1+1 &gt; 2. I believe projects that share value are just about to show us what it really means. In clear&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>One example is <a href="https://twitter.com/PanvalaHQ">Panvala</a>. Panvala puts synergy at its core and creates incentives for projects to share value. Its Digital Identity Coalition (aka <a href="https://t.me/bladerunnerDAO">Bladerunner</a>) brings projects related to human uniqueness and digital identity together. Many projects within that coalition would be considered competitors in the traditional business environment. In the blockchain world, they have a shared budget in PAN token. They decide together what to spend it&nbsp;on.</p><p>Another example is <a href="https://twitter.com/nowdaoit">DAOhaus’s</a> DAO of DAOs (called UberHaus) in which over 50 member DAOs govern the DAOhaus ecosystem, including the HAUS token supply and the development priorities. <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_">PrimeDAO</a> has a similar approach. There’s an emerging term for the phenomenon — Federated DAOs. I bet it is worth watching&nbsp;closely.</p><p>Apart from those, I couldn’t find other examples of projects that share any real value. That’s another opportunity — not only for <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> but for you as well. In the next part of the article, we gonna create our own example of value shared by multiple projects. This time the value is going to be shared through NFMs. This time you’ll have a first-mover advantage too.</p> Starting the resistance <p>Thank you for reading to this point. You are awesome, smart, and beautiful. Despite my clumsy attempts to deliver the message clearly, you started to see something. You are reading between the lines. [I’m gently switching to emotional you — we gonna need that soon]. WE gonna create a myth with an immense amount of value, a marketing department, and an army of fans - in the next 5&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>We have <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> — a decentralized identity solution — at the input. Its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Mission-d39324031ffd457381ade12f4ed0f960">mission</a> is to unite people at scale, it promotes the <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/price-of-forgery-digital-identity-measuring-human-uniqueness-score-in-dollars/8328">price of forgery concept</a> and the importance of distinguishing humans from bots. Strong mythology is already there, but it “belongs” to Upala and is not suited for sharing. WE gonna create a super-set myth for that. Wide enough to include mythology of any project related to digital identity. For better experience follow the article carefully.</p> Bringing the myth into existence <p>[Broaden your consciousness here]. Upload the following into your memory ̶p̶o̶o̶l̶: Terminator, Bladerunner, Matrix, sad robots, raise of the machines, artificial intelligence, robots rights, replicants seeking love. Stop for a moment and wait for other associations… Got a couple? Great. ̶N̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶r̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶r̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶i̶t̶!̶!̶!̶</p><blockquote>Try to remember when Boston dynamics started abusing their creatures?</blockquote><p>Now imagine. The opposition of humans and machines is already happening. We cannot see it, because it evolves slowly and naturally. The resistance forces are here too. Invisible, as they are scattered, have no coordination, and — most importantly — are not treated seriously. Individuals are considered mad. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17978596/stephen-hawking-ai-climate-change-robots-future-universe-earth">Precautions</a> from authorities like Stephen Hawking are referred mostly for&nbsp;fun.</p><p>Nevertheless, WE are the ancestors of those who will defeat Skynet (this thing is <a href="https://twitter.com/SkynetLabs">real AF</a>). It is our grand-grand-grand-… children who gonna inhabit the <a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Zion">city of Zion</a> It is us, who will refuse to treat robots as equals. It is us who will desire no&nbsp;peace.</p>  The resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it (your associations) are&nbsp;real.  It is not fiction — it is prediction. It is the&nbsp;future.  The resistance has already&nbsp;started.  <p>Take a moment and realize the meaning behind the last three lines… Close your eyes… Let your mind wander for a couple of seconds… Congratulations! We got our new myth! It exists now. You and everyone, who’s reading this are the carriers. And you know&nbsp;it.</p><p>Well, ok, not that exciting so far. I need your thoughts in this article, they are in&nbsp;italic.</p> Taking responsibility <p>Probably this is not very exciting so far. The myth still feels a bit humorous. In that sense, it is not much different from a <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1381911969402388484">random Twitter meme</a>. But WE don’t want it to come and go like thousands of similar memes. Let’s add some value to it. First, I tell you the following…</p><p>UNLIKE all those tweets I’m totally fucking serious! WE ARE starting the resistance. The real one. The coordinated one. I do realize it may sound crazy. But I’m not crazy. ̶M̶y̶ ̶m̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶h̶a̶d̶ ̶m̶e̶ ̶t̶e̶s̶t̶e̶d̶.̶ You already know I’m sane. You’ve read to this point. You already trust my judgment.</p><p>More importantly, I’m not a random person to make a declaration like that. I’m already building an anti-Sybil system, already started to spread awareness (<a href="https://docs.upala.id/en/latest/state-of-knowledge.html">Upala’s anti-Sybil academy</a>), contacted many like-minded people. I already started to&nbsp;resist.</p><blockquote>“anti-Sybil” simply means “resistant to bots” or “one human — one account”. When entering a website you are sometimes asked to select all images containing buses or (worst of all) traffic lights. This is an example of an anti-Sybil system. <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> is an anti-Sybil system because it provides a human uniqueness score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Wiki on Sybil-attack</a>.</blockquote><p>Even more importantly I have something to lose. I’m putting my reputation at stake. Right now Upala is actively looking for contributors and investors (<a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/an-open-letter-to-investors-a59c3813fc4b">an open letter to investors</a>). Hardly everyone gonna accept this wild move. Some people will feel doubtful about my judgment. It is a&nbsp;risk.</p><p>I’ve already taken some responsibility for the resistance and now taking even more. Check out the new section in our <a href="https://docs.upala.id/en/latest/state-of-knowledge.html">Sybil-resistance academy</a> — feel free to contribute. Join the new <a href="https://discord.gg/HPtfD3VZ6M">awareness</a> channel at Upala’s discord for coordination. If you wanna resist I’m your point of contact (<a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p">Twitter</a>).</p><p>You now know: this is where the resistance actually started. Right at THIS&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Hmm, this guy is totally nuts, but it all kinda makes sense. Or rather feels right. I wonder what comes&nbsp;next.</p> Sharing responsibility <p>Next stop. You. We are starting the resistance WITH you. That’s right if you are reading this you are a part of the resistance. I’m sharing responsibility with you. You now bear this knowledge. And you are now responsible to direct anyone who humbly mentions “the resistance” to this&nbsp;post.</p><p>Am I a part of the resistance? Well,&nbsp;ok.</p><p>You probably felt how the article became a bit bumpy. That is on purpose. I’m bumping and bumping it up in your head. The myth needs it. It came into existence thanks to you. Thanks to you it already has some strength and momentum.</p><p>Looks like it does have momentum. At least in my&nbsp;head.</p><p>Thank you for still being here. Take a deep breath, relax [and broaden your consciousness a bit more].&nbsp;Because…</p> Pumping up the&nbsp;value <p>I hereby declare the ownership of this myth. The whole thing. The resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it (your associations). The whole damn thing is now mine! Wait, what? For real? Yep, just like that. If you are curious this is how art works (to do links <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp">readymades</a>). I’ll explain in a moment what it all&nbsp;means.</p><p>Nah, no big deal, let him have&nbsp;it.</p><p>And this is quite a big&nbsp;deal!</p><p>Dough!</p><p>We can proceed to discuss the value&nbsp;now.</p><p>I created a tiny bit of value by defining the myth. Then you added a bit more by paying attention to it — I asked you to do it. Then we kept increasing the value together. I addressed the rational you many times during the article. I made you think and sometimes even feel. You made pauses to reflect and build associations. You noticed how this article is more penetrative to your brain than most of the regular articles out there (I told you this is not a regular one). You have a vague feeling that you gonna return to it soon. And you know that many other people will feel the same. You also know that there’s a reputation behind this myth, some actions made, responsibility, and your share of it. We did a good job in growing the value of the myth. And it raised significantly.</p><p>But it was nothing comparing to the value added when I made the first transaction. I unlocked the value by capturing it and making it mine. Minted it to myself, if you will. Or better say, you minted it to me. THANK! YOU! You thought of it as insignificant at first, but it is getting more and more real. It is easier to perceive it as valuable. Probably you feel a bit of regret and even&nbsp;envy.</p><p>No! I’m actually glad for this&nbsp;guy!</p><p>It is not clear yet, what owning a myth actually means. You’ll see that in a moment. But it is already clear that I can do whatever I want with it… And first… I’m gonna blow the value so high, that your fingers will tremble. You’d better sit down. Here we&nbsp;go…</p><p>Now… when everything is clear with the ownership of the myth… I hereby declare… that I present it all to you! WHAAAT? Yes, the resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it, the whole damn thing is now YOURS!… yeah!!!…&nbsp;YEAH!!!</p><p>ARE YOU FUCKING FEELING IT?!!! WHAT A MOMENT!!! THIS IS SO AWESOOOME!!! THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!!! [Shouting hard and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3gbAut2reI&amp;t=5s">burning a teddy&nbsp;bear</a>!]</p><p>If you are reading this you are an owner. Just like me. Just. Like. That. Now you share not just the responsibility, but the value as well!!! And this is where the value skyrocketed…</p><p>Now it is easier to discuss what WE can do with it. [Proceed with a comfortable consciousness level].</p> Takeaways <p>Now that we have this shared myth what is possible? How you can benefit? There are a couple of examples below. Short answer — acknowledge the myth, join the resistance and be active. Grow the resistance, spread awareness of it for your own benefit and for the benefit of humankind. It is your luck is to stumble upon this among the first. It is your choice now how to act. And when to&nbsp;act.</p> Build it <p>Explore the myth, create within it and expand it. If you are an artist (in a broad sense, a creator) you now have an additional channel to get heard. You are one of the myth owners. Owning the myth is like owning a smart contract, e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKitties">CryptoKitties</a> contract. But Unlike CryptoKitties the contract is social, there is no code. And unlike CryptoKitties the myth is general. You can attach (breed) any type of art to it: text, visuals, audio, or code (interaction mechanics). Or it is like <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-616">Marvel’s Earth-616</a> universe, except that it is not built yet. Anyone can fill it with characters, events, and&nbsp;stories.</p><p>Just create a piece of art that is relevant to the myth. Then acknowledge the myth. Mention one of the following lines: “Vive La Sybil Resistance”, “Welcome to resistance”, “This is resistance”, “Humans vs Machines”, “You are now part of the resistance”. Use #ViveLaSybilResistance or a shorter #NoBots hashtag on Twitter. Mention this article. These are the ways to find people with shared values (and shared value😉). These are the breeding mechanics I can think of. Other ways of attaching to this meme are possible. Explore&nbsp;them!</p><p>At the start, while your node of resistance is not strong enough, you’d probably gonna need some support. Ping me and I’ll mention your work, so it could be discovered easier. Don’t be humble — I got incentives for that. I’m one of the owners and I acknowledged the myth — by sharing I increase the value of the whole myth and of my share as a consequence. A gift is an addition.</p> Hodl it <p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p">me</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> on Twitter and wait for #NoBots or #ViveLaSybilResistance tags. Follow <a href="https://discord.gg/vhNZBPFXxU">NFMs channel</a> on Upala Discord. You can be among the first to grab a part of history. Fun fact — you cannot be 100% selfish. Buying is acknowledging. Buying increases the value of the bought item and the value of the entire resistance myth as well. Buying is a&nbsp;gift.</p><blockquote><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/upala-sybil-resistance-forces">Official OpenSea collection</a> is part of the resistance, as well as this <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1381911969402388484">tweet</a>, this <a href="https://themillionetherhomepage.com/">ancient project</a> with broken front-end, <a href="https://mooncatrescue.com/">Mooncats</a>. Everyone I mentioned in this article is a part of the resistance. Everything they do is important for this myth, for blockchain, for humanity, for&nbsp;good.</blockquote> Share it <p>Spread the knowledge — share this article, shill artists you like and their works, bring new people into the resistance. Fun fact — you cannot be 100% altruistic. When dealing with history, timing matters the most. By sharing you become an early adopter. Sharing regularly increases your weight in the resistance. One day you may use your weight for your own benefit. Sharing does have&nbsp;value.</p> Conclusion <p>Our new resistance mythology includes Upala’s Sybil-resistance mythology entirely. Both are interconnected. When mentioning the resistance you also mean that humans are important, they have rights by the mere fact of being born, you mention <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/identification-development-global-dataset">1 bln people without ID</a>, who need help. Moving down to earth you make people aware of decentralized ID systems and the term Sybil-resistance. Lastly, you promote <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a>. The resistance is now Upala’s marketing department.</p><p>But WE created a lot more! As the scope of the resistance mythology is much wider than Upala’s many other projects may find that their mythology can be a subset of it. As the ownership is shared they may acknowledge the myth and start expanding it with no approval. It is like creating a project-specific flavor of Linux. It may look very different, but everyone would know it is still Linux. The more a project contributes to the myth, the stronger its resistance node becomes. And the stronger the entire resistance gets. Every member of resistance is incentivized to support other members. Because both creating and sharing an NFM increases the entire myth’s value. Incentives aligned. Win-win. We created the basis for a decentralized shared marketing department. Thank&nbsp;you!</p><p>WE started it all TOGETHER. The resistance already gained strength and value. With a little help, it may become self-sufficient and live longer than any project or even humans involved. The value behind it is uncapped. It is all up to us. Remember this is the genesis and you are as close to it as one can get. Be among the first to add value to it.

<p>In the physical world, you sign a document and become responsible for its contents, including the duties and liabilities entailed in it. While it’s possible to forge or duplicate these physical signatures, it’s not&nbsp;easy.</p><p>But what about the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>The option to copy and paste signatures makes it a breeze to forge&nbsp;them.</p><p>Hence, it became necessary to have Digital Signature Schemes (DSS) to establish the signer’s identity and to reduce the risk of&nbsp;forgery.</p><p>Broadly speaking, digital signature schemes have two components,</p>  A private signing algorithm to securely identify the&nbsp;signer  A public verification algorithm to verify the authenticity of the&nbsp;signer.  <p>Many digital signature schemes have these two components, and today, we’ll talk about one such signature schema — BBS+ Signatures.</p><p>This digital signature was created by Dan Boneh, Xavier Boyen, and Hovav Shacham using the strong Diffie-Hellman encryption technique, and hence the name BBS (after their respective surnames). The original signature was modified later to include proof of knowledge, and hence the name&nbsp;BBS+</p> What is the BBS+ Signature Scheme? <p>The BBS+ signature scheme is a DSS that can have two distinct parties, namely, the signer and the signature holder. Here the signature holder is the owner of a signature while the signer is the entity authenticating that the signature belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>Essentially, what happens is that the signature holder enters into a Pedersen commitment with the&nbsp;signer.</p><p>Before moving further, let’s digress a bit here to understand the Pedersen commitment as this is the building block of BBS+ electronic signatures.</p> Understanding the Pedersen Commitment <p>A Pedersen commitment is a scheme that allows a sender to commit to a secret value that can be revealed in the future. Until then, the sender transmits a commitment to preserve the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Until the sender chooses, the secret remains private and can be revealed only when the sender displays a necessary parameter that’s agreed as a part of the commitment process. This commitment allows senders to commit to a ton of data in one-go and at the same time, no hacker or even an advanced quantum computer can access all of that data until the sender decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a simple&nbsp;example.</p><p>Let’s say, Bob creates a secret and sends a commitment of the secret to Alice. Here, the commitment can be a cryptographic value like a hash function or discrete logarithms, and this is stored by Alice. Remember, she doesn’t know Bob’s secret and can’t find out with the commitment value&nbsp;either.</p><p>In the future, Bob decides to reveal the secret, and Alice checks this secret against the commitment to verify that Bob hasn’t changed the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Besides Bob and Alice, no one else knows about its existence.</p><p>Now, let’s extrapolate this Pedersen commitment to BBS+ signatures.</p> BBS+ Signatures and Pedersen Commitment <p>As mentioned above, BBS group signatures create the possibility for the signer and the signature holder to be two different entities, like Alice and Bob. The commitment is the connecting aspect, and the contents are blinded until the holder decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, these signatures give complete control to the holder to decide when and what must be revealed, and follow the principles of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> where the holder can prove the required identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p> BBS+Signatures in Verifiable Credentials <p>All these features make it a good DSS for implementing verifiable credentials. Also, a key advantage of BBS+ Signatures is that it allows a part of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a> to be shared with&nbsp;others.</p><p>For example, let’s say the issuer is a startup company that issues VCs containing the date of birth and address of the holder. Next, the holder wants to share the address with a verifier for a delivery process, so the holder can share a part of the VC (only the address) without sharing the date of birth. This is possible only when the verifiable credential is fragmented into multiple individual fields, each secured by a signature.</p><p>Here is an example of a VC implementation with BBS+ signature.</p> {<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>": [<br>    "<a href="http://schema.org/">http://schema.org/</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://w3id.org/security/v2">https://w3id.org/security/v2</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1">https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1</a>"<br>  ],<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>": "Person",<br>  "firstName": "Jane",<br>  "lastName": "Does",<br>  "jobTitle": "Professor",<br>  "telephone": "(425) 123-4567",<br>  "email": "<a href="mailto:jane.doe@example.com">jane.doe@example.com</a>",<br>  "proof": {<br>    "type": "BbsBlsSignature2020",<br>    "created": "2020-04-25",<br>    "verificationMethod": "did:example:489398593#test",<br>    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",<br>    "proofValue": "F9uMuJzNBqj4j+HPTvWjUN/MNoe6KRH0818WkvDn2Sf7kg1P17YpNyzSB+CH57AWDFunU13tL8oTBDpBhODckelTxHIaEfG0rNmqmjK6DOs0/ObksTZh7W3OTbqfD2h4C/wqqMQHSWdXXnojwyFDEg==",<br>    "requiredRevealStatements": [4,5]<br>  }<br>} <p>Each field in the VC, like the firstName, lastName, jobTitle, etc, is a separate signature and the holder has the option to pick one or more of these fields and include them in a verifiable presentation.</p><p>This example can be extended to any of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world VC use-cases</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> from Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">Hackathon</a>.</p><p>In fact, this ability to share just the required information follows the principle of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-2-nuclear-disarmament-abb5c879a7c5">ZKP</a> and is a secure way for the holder to safely share what’s required to the concerned verifier. At the same time, note that BBS+ signatures are not identical to ZKPs as there’s an option to fragment and reveal just some parts of the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In this sense, BBS+ signatures are selective disclosures controlled completely by the holder where every field in the VC has a signature. Hence, the VC itself becomes a compilation of individual signatures, one for each&nbsp;field.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of BBS+ Signatures <p>At Affinidi, we’re in the process of implementing this BBS group signature schema where we allow the holder to build a presentation with only the required fields from a credential. There’s also a process in place to verify that the fragmented credential is&nbsp;valid.</p><p>To learn more about what we do, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.

			 Barbora Prochazkova is Project Manager at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Barbora, I am 32 and currently live in Mondorf-les-Bains, a little thermal town in Luxembourg. I was born and raised in Komarno, a lovely town in the south of Slovakia. As a child of socialism in former Czechoslovakia, I have been fortunate to have parents that made my childhood wonderfully ‘Pippi Longstocking’ like – adventurous but disciplined, filled with books, outdoor activities, household chores, and exciting travels to the close and faraway towns and lands :).</p>
<p>Despite how good or less good our financial situation was, I greatly admired their ability to take us on a few trips every year, which considerably contributed to the hodophile I grew into. My wanderlust has fully surfaced during my teenage years and I owe it (and the books) invaluable life lessons on humility, gratefulness, and appreciation of being here and now. Reading about and observing how we humans from different corners of the world live, think, collaborate, love and mourn, (hopefully) taught me to be more open-minded, understanding, helpful, and patient in daily interactions with my fellow humans.</p>
<p>I have always been amazed by the great that can come out when people from different cultures exchange their ideas and openly collaborating. And as no university offered a paid degree in ‘travelling, yoga, reading books and becoming a better human’ ( I strongly hope this has changed since :)), I chose what seemed the second-best option at that time and went to study international business. I spent part of my studies in Tuscany, where apart from travelling, eating, and learning how to relax (a skill I so wish to get better at), I met my travel buddy and partner in crime and life, Alex. After Italy, we lived and worked in Slovakia for a couple of years, but soon felt the need to put on our travelling pants again and move out for a few years. And we landed in Luxembourg.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I often joke that be it not for Daniel Coheur’s persistence and incredibly charming interpersonal skills (I am sure people who know Daniel will attest to this), I would have been long gone from Luxembourg – most probably some place sunnier 😉</p>
<p>While I was at my previous company, I was handling and wrapping up a service migration project for clients of a telecommunication operator when I received the email from Daniel. At that time, he was actually my client, representing the company for whom we’ve been doing the migration and was on the copy of most of the emails I was sending out. In his email, he complimented me on my working style, congratulated me on a job well done, and told me that together with a partner of his, Luc, Tokeny’s CEO, they are currently starting a new company and looking for someone to manage the clients and the implementation of the technical solutions and thinks I would be a great fit.</p>
<p>I was very flattered, but I thanked him and politely explained that I am not searching for a change at the moment. He wasn’t ready to let it go yet, wrote me a bit more about the company and also mentioned that his wife is also Slovak and that graduated from the same university. What are the odds? I came clean and told him that the job definitely sounds interesting but that I want to be 100% honest and admitted that I am planning to leave Luxembourg in less than a year and wouldn’t find it fair to start in a new position. He quickly responded that if that is my only worry, worried I shan’t be and if I would want, I can move out with my job if I want to. We all met for lunch, had a very good talk, exchanged ideas and expectations, and soon after I started at Tokeny as Account Success/Implementation Manager.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Dynamic, ever-changing, sometimes stressful, but very supportive, open-minded, and fun. The team is everything, a soul of the company, and they are wonderful. I have worked with various tech teams, but never have I ever experienced such a strong commitment to delivering the best possible solution, striving to go above and beyond. This invaluable and comforting feeling that we have our back. When the fit hits the shan, which it sometimes does, we stress later, pull our sleeves up and if possible, get the job done in the best possible way. If not possible, we make sure we learned the most of it so that we can build on it and avoid it in the future. I very much appreciate how very different we all are, speak different languages, have various working styles and cultures that shaped us. Working with a remote team definitely has its challenges and is not always a piece of cake, but a kind Slack message and regular calls are doing wonders.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>About learning to live a better life I would say. The complexity of the consciousness, wonders of minds, and the existence of the world as we know it fascinate me. When I can, I read or listen to audiobooks on mindfulness, neuroscience, moral philosophy, psychotherapy, the use of psychedelics in it… I truly LOVE walking (a day without a walk is a day wrongly planned), gardening, and just being outdoors in general.</p>
<p></p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is to be able to say to myself that I did the best I could with what I had, learned how to be genuinely present, undistracted, and most appreciative of the one life I have. I like to think of it as striving to live up to one’s potential and honouring the gift of life. The traveller in me would also say that I wish to work no more than 4 hours a week and dedicate the rest of the time to my family, my human kindred spirits, reading, exploring, walking, and giving back. However, I do hope to become a parent one day, and seeing my children grow into wonderful, engaged, morally strong, and happy humanists would be the ultimate dream.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Oh, so many things. I would love for all of us to be able to feel and acknowledge that helping our less fortunate fellow humans is not an extra, a nice, or big-of-oneself thing to do, but simply our moral obligation. Randomness plays a huge role in where and to whom we are born and hugely predetermines the paths most of us can take, the education we can get, the people we can become or connect with, the jobs we can get. I would love to get everyone from the ‘well-off’ side of the pond which I myself am a lucky occupant to dedicate at least 1% of their net annual income towards shrinking the fast-growing gap between the rich and poor. I am a big proponent of effective altruism myself and hope to be strong enough to dedicate 5% of my net annual net income by 40. I would also ensure that everyone has the same access to high-quality education, which would result in a significant rise in critical thinking and information processing, which would eventually lead to the end of violent religions as we know them now.</p>

On the site, you can find everything from insights into the biggest events shaping the crypto industry to content that meets readers where they are in their journey of learning about blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As a fan of the publication, I was thrilled to talk with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemhamilton/">Luke Hamilton</a>, Senior Software Engineer. In this post, I’ll cover how the Decrypt team streamlined development and onboarding to launch Decrypt Tokens and Drops — along with how crypto DNA and a leading product and team drove their trust in&nbsp;Magic.</p> Incentivizing readers to earn as they&nbsp;learn <p>Decrypt is the gateway into the decentralized world. What’s unique about the reader experience is its clear-eyed storytelling and accessibility. Decrypt content caters to various levels of existing crypto knowledge.</p><p>Back in 2019, the team had ambitions to deepen the reader experience and connect further to their ethos of education through using decentralized technology.</p><p>Fast forward two years of behind-the-scenes work by their product team, that vision is now brought to life with the launch of Decrypt Token (DCPT), a new reader token that lives inside the Decrypt mobile app. According to the team, “The token is our way of participating in the decentralized industry we cover, and experimenting with how cryptocurrency can spur reader engagement.”</p><p>So, what’s in it for readers? The opportunity to earn as they learn. Every week, unique digital rewards — called <a href="https://drops.decrypt.co/">Drops</a> — become available and redeemable with Decrypt tokens. It’s an ingenious way to assign value to actions, thank readers for their loyalty, all while also encouraging hands-on interaction with&nbsp;crypto.</p> Novel reader tokens and rewards inside a mobile&nbsp;app <p>During the development process, Luke and the team tackled the question of how to authenticate users. They explored whether to build their own authentication or integrate with an existing auth solution.</p><p>Internally, there was already substantial discussion about going passwordless for the tokens MVP (minimal viable product). For Decrypt, the biggest benefits to passwordless login were improvements to UX and that several forward-thinking brands had started to make passwordless login increasingly popular with&nbsp;users.</p><p>At the time, work on traditional username and password flow had already begun. But after assessing where the app was and what was left to do in the critical path, Luke realized they had not yet solved issues around account recovery. After evaluating the large effort it’d require their lean engineering team to build out forgot password, reset password, and so on, Luke decided not to continue to invest in a traditional auth flow and instead, implement Magic.</p><p>Natural excitement for Magic sparked at first discovery because of the companies’ shared philosophies on&nbsp;crypto.</p><blockquote>“Choosing Magic further bolstered the credibility of our&nbsp;ethos.”</blockquote><p>The product also stood out as the passwordless auth solution with future-proof crypto and identity tech under the&nbsp;hood.</p><blockquote>“The clear aha moment came when we realized Magic does exactly what we wanted, functionally and philosophically: frictionless login for users and decentralized identity aligned to our&nbsp;mission.</blockquote><blockquote>There weren’t that many competing solutions or anything remotely comparable; it’s fully-featured and production-ready.”</blockquote><p>Luke estimates that continuing to build password-based auth would have added “at least another month” to their roadmap. In just a week, email magic links were up and running in Decrypt’s mobile app for their private&nbsp;beta.</p><p>The process of implementation was streamlined primarily thanks to Magic’s simple documentation and proactive customer support. Luke counts the responsiveness to his questions and genuine partnership mindset as most impressive, highlighting the customer-centric team behind the&nbsp;product.</p> Successful user adoption at&nbsp;scale <p>Decrypt has seen remarkable success in the months immediately following their beta and public launches. Over 50,000 users have already downloaded their mobile app to engage with content and earn tokens, and Decrypt is expecting hundreds of thousands more users by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Luke is certain Magic played a key role in appealing to broader audiences who want to get their hands on the latest technology and trends in crypto. Sign up and login is easy and fast; users can set up their in-app wallet in literally a few&nbsp;seconds.</p><blockquote>“User growth is the best proof there is. Less friction for users leads to higher conversion.”</blockquote><p>He’s also the first to recommend Magic to colleagues and is now solely building auth with Magic for his passion projects as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>“I’m working on my own rewards app and had to switch from Auth0 to use&nbsp;Magic.”</blockquote><p>The coolest part: innovation around tokens is just getting started. To kick off the first season of Decrypt Drops, the team launched an exclusive NFT (<a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain">non-fungible tokens</a>) series. In the future, Drops will evolve to include a host of different rewards and functionality.</p><p>Together with Magic, Decrypt is reaching record reader growth and engagement. Through seamless onboarding and innovative experiences powered by blockchain technology, the Decrypt and Magic teams are co-advocating for the future of the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/decrypt-trusts-magic-to-onboard-record-new-user-growth-with-the-launch-of-reader-tokens-and-rewards-14d791e582d5">Decrypt trusts Magic to onboard record new user growth with the launch of reader tokens and rewards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the alpha launch of Tezos Profiles (TZP), which can be found at <a href="https://tzprofiles.com/">tzprofiles.com</a>.</p><p>TZP is a web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms, and enables the creation of portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over public social media accounts and by self-attesting information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We encourage users to start creating and launching their profiles as we begin integrating Tezos Profiles support across the Tezos ecosystem. Currently, we are focused exclusively on publicly available information and accounts to avoid privacy issues. We will support private verifications in the future, once the proper security and privacy measures are in place for those workflows.</p><p>We’ve also open-sourced Tezos Profiles and the repository can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/tzprofiles">here</a>.</p> Integrations <p>We wanted to make it easy for any development teams to use Tezos Profiles within their own applications. Therefore, we are releasing an SDK that tzprofiles.com itself uses to resolve, verify, and update claims. It can be found within our GitHub, with improved documentation on the&nbsp;way.</p><p>We are currently helping Tezos ecosystem members such as Hic Et Nunc, TzKT, Kukai, and Tezos Domains to integrate Tezos Profiles, enabling new forms of Sybil resistance and creator authentication. If you would like first-class support on an open-source Tezos Profiles integration for your application, please reach out in our <a href="https://t.me/tezosprofiles">support telegram</a>.</p> How to Launch Your&nbsp;Profile <p>**Note: In this alpha release, only tz1 addresses are supported. However, we’re working quickly to add tz2 support (e.g. DirectAuth via Kukai) via our next upgrade.**</p><p>First, visit <a href="https://tzprofiles.com">https://tzprofiles.com</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>To start, select the network you wish to connect to and connect your wallet using&nbsp;Beacon.</p><p>Once connected, you will be presented with two available credentials: Basic Profile Information and a Twitter Account Verification for the alpha launch. To start, click on “Basic Profile Information” to begin filling in some core profile information about yourself.</p><p>Once you’ve filled in your profile information, click “Sign Profile” in order to self-issue your credential. After this, you can move on to your Twitter Account Verification.</p><p>This workflow will require you to first enter your Twitter handle, sign a message using your wallet, tweet that message and signature, and lastly, verify that message using the service. Once that’s complete, return to your profile to launch your associated smart contract.</p><p>Once you have uploaded your credentials to Kepler and deployed your smart contract, congratulations — you now have an on-chain Tezos&nbsp;Profile!</p><p>Using our viewer, you can now view anyone’s public profile with their associated credentials.</p> Future Plans <p>We have an additional number of features and verifications lined up to be integrated into Tezos Profiles in the near future. Some of these&nbsp;include:</p>  A redesign of the interface that enables users to view, update, and delete their credentials.  An Instagram account verification for&nbsp;artists.  Public messaging account verifications such as Telegram and&nbsp;Discord.  Tezos domain ownership proofs.  <p>— -</p><p>Follow us on<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">&nbsp;LinkedIn</a></p><p>We’re always looking for user feedback on our products.

<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when someone would have looked perplexed if you’d asked about their digital identity. Many still would today, perhaps but in the tumultuous world of 2021, digital identity is one of the hottest trends in technology, particularly across decentralized ledgers, or blockchains.

The goal of this project is to help the Kenya Red Cross leverage Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol on Tezos to provide much-needed cash transfers to vulnerable Kenyan populations.</p><p>Gravity’s vision is to build human-centered digital ID solutions for easy, transparent and secure data sharing for all people, anywhere in the world. With Gravity, individuals and small business owners can safely store and share their personal data to access humanitarian aid, financing, employment, and government services. In cases like the DIGID project, international organizations can also leverage our digital ID solutions to efficiently collect verifiable data for improved service delivery, interoperability, and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>With humanitarian aid projects like DIGID, Gravity’s goal is to help end-users and partners progressively adopt and implement this decentralized identity protocol to open the door to even greater financial inclusion for vulnerable populations. The reality is that Gravity’s humanitarian aid solution supports populations who are not yet familiar with advanced blockchain technology. By taking a human-centered design approach and meeting our partners and end-users where they are at, we will continue to adapt and build our protocol on Tezos based on real-time needs.</p><p>The DIGID project is a manifestation of our ongoing collaboration with the <a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> ecosystem to bring our decentralized identity solutions to vulnerable populations of humanitarian aid recipients, refugees, and displaced persons around the world. Among the latest <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-test-suite/implementations/">verifiable credential implementations recognized by W3C standards</a>, Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol is built on Tezos to ensure that our protocol is more scalable, standardized, and transparent.</p><p>With Gravity’s protocol built on Tezos blockchain, together we can empower all individuals to access key services (humanitarian aid, financing, educational certification, e-government services) and accelerate their path toward financial inclusion. Gravity’s use cases include facilitating humanitarian aid and cash transfers to remote communities in East Africa, supply chain financing for small business owners in Kenya, and educational certification for Syrian refugees to access greater employment opportunities in&nbsp;Turkey.</p> Why Tezos? <p>The Tezos protocol aligns with Gravity’s high security standards and our vision for a digital identity platform that builds trusted digital identities on blockchain that are private, portable, and persistent. We believe in Tezos ecosystem’s focus on formal verification of smart contracts and on-chain governance, which allow for everyone to participate by submitting proposals to be voted on to update the Tezos environment.</p><blockquote>According to Gravity co-founder Johannes Ebert: “The Tezos ecosystem’s democratic, community-based, decentralized form of on-chain governance is consistent with Gravity’s vision for our own ecosystem. Like Tezos, Gravity’s solution focuses on decentralizing and community-sourcing our protocol to comply with the latest W3C standards.”</blockquote><p>Tezos also fits in with Gravity’s human-centric vision, which values community-based input and a decentralized approach to create more innovative and effective solutions that truly meet the needs of all stakeholders along the data supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Lastly, Tezos is particularly suitable for Gravity’s decentralized identity use cases due to its affordable transaction costs and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) compatibility.</p> What’s on-chain? <p>Following <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a>’s initial implementation of the <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/decentralized-identity-with-the-tezos-did-method-d9cf6676dd64">Tezos DID Method</a>, Gravity implemented our own version of the Tezos <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID Method</a> and <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID&nbsp;Manager</a>.</p><p>Gravity’s strong beliefs in maximum privacy and a user’s right to be forgotten mean that we only store specific pieces of personal data on-chain. The on-chain attributes contained within the DID manager&nbsp;include:</p>  Authentication public key: Used by remote parties to verify a signature with an “authentication” purpose (in W3C terms), most frequently used during the sharing of credentials,  AssertionMethod public key: Also for use by remote parties to verify signatures with an “assertionMethod” purpose (in W3C terms), usually used during credential issuance,  KeyAgreement public key: Used by remote parties to compute the shared secret necessary for end to end encryption.  Link to credential repository: A link to a dedicated space on the credential repository which allows issuers to know where to send credentials post encryption, and  TZIP-16 metadata link: Standard that helps attach off-chain metadata to the DID manager, allowing for the inclusion of metadata&nbsp;views.  <p>These attributes are all retrieved by <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">Gravity’s specific DID Resolver</a> which is embedded within the Universal DID Resolver to allow for the re-computation of the related DID document.</p><p>Most recently, we integrated the much-anticipated <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/contract-metadata-on-tezos-e4c692e2f6ba#:~:text=TZIP%2D16%20proposes%20a%20method,custom%20extensions%20(e.g.%20a%20multimedia">Contract Metadata (TZIP-16) standard</a>, which makes integration, discoverability and querying of Tezos smart contracts easier and scalable for applications and&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>The sky’s the limit for Tezos and Gravity, and we are excited to continue growing with and learning from the global Tezos community!</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravity-earth">LinkedIn</a> for recent updates. <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/subscription">Sign up for our Gravity newsletter</a> for the latest Gravity&nbsp;news!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027">Gravity’s Decentralized Identity Protocol, Built on Tezos, To Power DIGID Project in Kenya</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">Gravity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Urbit community has grown at a rapid clip throughout 2021. There are so many exciting things going on that it's hard to convey them all, even with Developer Calls happening every two weeks. This event will function as a virtual "mini-conference" where we'll give a series of important and exciting announcements, including both formal and informal talks from many members of our community.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what we'll be discussing:</p>
 Introduction: State of the Network 
<p>12:00 PDT, Josh Lehman</p>
<p>Urbit is under heavy, active development by both Tlon and a wide range of contributors. Josh Lehman will discuss some of the most important areas of work being undertaken, provide a picture of where Tlon and community efforts are going in the future, and even has a few exciting announcements to make.</p>
 Taisho, Urbit's Port City 
<p>~12:20 PDT, Hunter Miller</p>
<p>Piloting an Urbit ship requires expertise that many lack. To achieve the rich and prosperous ecosystem we've all envisioned requires making that journey easier. In this talk, Hunter Miller introduces a new way for users to join the network with minimal effort.</p>
 Keynote: The Revenge of Teleology 
<p>~13:00 PDT, Justin Murphy</p>
<p>Teleology—or inquiry into ultimate ends—has been out of fashion since the seventeenth century, when Francis Bacon said that, “like a virgin consecrated to God,” it “produces nothing.” I argue that the digital revolution is inverting Bacon’s claim. Baconian instrumentalism is now suffering from diminishing returns—it is what the youth today call a Boomer Ideology. Rather, the greatest gains are going to individuals and communities with teleological attitudes. This talk will observe some examples and present a model consistent with the observations. Bitcoin inquires after the telos of money, the most winning independent “content creators” inquire after the telos of media, and Urbit inquires after the telos of personal computing.</p>
 Lightning Talks 
<p>14:00 PDT, you?</p>
<p>After the scheduled talks we'll break out into a series of 30 minute talks led by community members. There will be up to three talks given in parallel at each of 14:00 PDT, 14:30 PDT and 15:00 PDT (so nine talks total).</p>
<p>If you'd like to give a talk, please use <a href="https://airtable.com/shr0Xmqcv1HSy47EP">this form to sign up</a>. You can see the full list of <a href="https://airtable.com/shreGQ4kCU8RA5GJS/tblTZxCpqedJBwSkE">proposed talks here</a>, and if you'd like to voice your support for any of these specifically, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrhNRUAGCqZ38VXA">cast a vote using this form</a>.</p>

<p>The game can be implemented such that the central server only handles queries about current deck state, and so could be swapped out for a solution with no trusted third party at a later time.  Everything else can be handled player-side, including signing attestations of game state at different points.</p>
