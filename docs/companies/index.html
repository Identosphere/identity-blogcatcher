<p>Quality Assurance (QA) is a critical component of the software development lifecycle, aiming to ensure that software products meet specified quality standards before release. QA encompasses a systematic and strategic approach to identifying, preventing and resolving issues throughout the development process. </p>



<p>However, various challenges arise in the QA domain that affect test case inventory, test case automation and defect volume. Managing test case inventory can become problematic due to the sheer volume of cases, which lead to inefficiencies and resource constraints. Test case automation, while beneficial, can pose challenges in terms of selecting appropriate cases, safeguarding proper maintenance and achieving comprehensive coverage. Defect volume is a perpetual concern, impacting software quality and release timelines. </p>



<p>Overcoming these challenges demands a thoughtful and proactive approach to streamline test cases, optimize automation effectiveness and minimize the volume of defects in the QA process. Balancing these aspects is crucial for delivering high-quality software products that meet user expectations and industry standards.</p>



 How IBM helps 



<p>To reduce test case volume, it’s essential to focus on test case optimization. This process involves identifying redundant or overlapping test cases and consolidating them to cover multiple scenarios. Prioritizing test cases based on critical functionalities and potential risks to streamline the testing effort is also important. Additionally, leveraging risk-based testing allows teams to allocate resources where they are most needed, optimizing coverage without compromising quality. Test case automation effectiveness can be enhanced through careful planning and continuous maintenance. </p>



<p>Another way is to choose the test cases wisely for automation, focusing on repetitive, time-consuming and critical scenarios. It is also necessary to regularly update automated test scripts to adapt to changes in the application, making sure they remain relevant and reliable. A proactive approach for defects involves implementing robust testing methodologies, such as shift-left testing, where testing activities are initiated earlier in the development process. Conducting thorough code reviews, employing static analysis tools and emphasizing collaboration between development and testing teams to catch and address defects early.</p>



<p>IBM® brings in all this through The IBM IGNITE Quality Platform (IQP), which is a DevOps-enabled single sign-on platform that leverages AI capabilities and patented methods to optimize tests. The platform brings in shift left methodologies that promote faster automation with healing capabilities and predict and prevent defects, which in turn drive high-quality delivery that supports the end to end testing lifecycle of an organization.</p>



 It consists of the following pillars: 



 Administer:  



<p>Supported through an Integrated Platform that manages multiple tenants, users, applications, projects and all necessary functional and technical configurations needed across the testing journey, centrally at one place. Likewise, it supports quality plan journey that aims to reduce defects. It is also integrated with quality recommendations that flow in from other components and multiple third-party integrations, which include leading git-based repositories, test and defect tools and cloud-based web and mobile testing tools</p>



 Optimize:  



<p>Aimed towards creating the optimal set of testcases with 100% coverage and bring in a shift left in surfacing defects early.</p>



 
 Requirement analytics (RA): NLP-based tool for analysis of requirements to identify ambiguity, drive in shift left and determine complexity. It also aids semi-automatic identification of key attributes for the optimization journey. 



 Search tag &amp; model (STAM): Text-based analytics tool for quick analysis of a huge number of existing tests to identify redundancy and identify key attributes for the optimization journey. 



 *Optimization (TO): *Combinatorial Test Design Methodology-based tool that enables building an optimized test plan with maximum coverage from existing requirements, existing tests, YAML and even relational data. Also includes reusability via attribute pool and functional context modelling concepts. 
 



 Automate:  



<p>Aimed to quickly generate and automate and execute multiple tests unattended on various data, environments and platforms.</p>



 
 Test Generation (TG): Helps generate both TO model-based and nonmodel-based tests, ready for both manual and automated testing. It also supports custom BDD generation for client-based frameworks, automatic BDD script generation through recording mechanism and quick conversion of custom selenium-based frameworks to IQP specific automation. 



 Optimized Test Flow Automation (OTFA): Cucumber-based scriptless test automation framework supporting automation of Web, Mobile, REST, SOAP based applications, with a built-in test healing capability and integrated Jmeter-based performance testing and visual testing. 
 



 Analyze:  



<p>Trained in understanding a client’s defect patterns—cognitive test components drive quicker resolution, provides insight, and makes predictions around defects, which in turn gives preventive recommendations across Agile and traditional engagements. It also supports in better planning and reduced test cycles using defect prediction capability.</p>



 
 Defect classify (IDC): Plug-in solution for on-the-go classification and automatic assignment of defects&nbsp;to aid faster defect analysis and resolution. 



 Defect Analytics (IDA): Designed using defect reduction methodology that understands the semantics of the defects and provides prevention recommendations to reduce them further. 



 Defect Predict (IDP): Assesses and predicts defect trend in a test cycle aiding better planning and test management. 
 



 Our differentiated automation approaches 



<p>Prioritizing optimization over automation: This is our&nbsp;strategy to mitigate waste snowball effect by adopting multiple shift-left methodologies. We leverage a modern framework that is Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) enabled and incorporates low-code practices. Our approach extends to comprehensive automation covering Web, Mobile, API and SOAP-based applications, seamlessly integrated with performance testing.</p>



<p>Embracing a philosophy of continuous testing, our strategy is to intricately weave all functions into the DevOps pipeline, promoting a cohesive and efficient development lifecycle.

<p>Integration is essential to every business. As businesses consider the core of their IT infrastructure, their focus might be on their data and applications. But without integration, the data would be locked into siloes; and the applications would be isolated and overloaded with complexity as fragile, tightly coupled connections were added to allow applications to work together and share information. This impacts business agility—slowing both actions—and the ability to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses are trying to reduce these data exchange barriers through digital transformation to boost innovation and speed to market. But the risk of transformation efforts includes compounding IT complexity and creating even more business data that may have access restrictions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Effective integration is essential for driving a successful digital journey. Integration helps connect, automate and digitally transform businesses. It enables businesses to securely connect and share data between their applications and services across hybrid cloud environments. With effective integration, businesses can boost efficiency, productivity, innovation and knowledge sharing. &nbsp;Their applications and data become more accessible; their environments more resilient and agile; and new integrations are faster and simpler to create and deploy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration, organizations are able to unleash their business potential, deliver new experiences, improve customer outcomes and enable automations that can scale across the enterprise. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud Pak for Integration is a hybrid integration platform that brings together a comprehensive set of integration components that are designed and optimized to work together, deployed on Red Hat® OpenShift®. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud Pak for Integration enables your business to meet and expedite any integration need. Your business might want to access and share information quickly and simply using APIs. Perhaps you need to discover what’s happening in your business and respond quickly to events. And the business certainly needs to securely and reliably access and update record systems at scale using robust messaging and connectivity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the rest of this paper, we will explore how Cloud Pak for Integration, deployed on Red Hat OpenShift is the best way to provide integrations deploying in AWS.&nbsp;</p>



 What is ROSA?&nbsp; 



<p>Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/">ROSA</a>) is a fully managed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/containers/">application platform</a> that allows you to focus on deploying applications and accelerate innovation by offloading the cluster lifecycle management to Red Hat and AWS. ROSA is jointly engineered and supported by AWS and Red Hat. It is native to the AWS console, which reduces complexity and expands the available toolsets with native applications and integrations with AWS services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ROSA also enables customers to focus their resources on delivering business value rather than spending valuable time on the undifferentiated management of the underlying platform.&nbsp;</p>



  Why ROSA for Cloud Pak for Integration in AWS?&nbsp; 



<p>Cloud Pak for Integration runs on Red Hat OpenShift. Therefore, a Red Hat OpenShift cluster must be configured and running to install and configure Cloud Pak for Integration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides a managed Red Hat OpenShift Cluster and is a supported configuration for Cloud Pak for Integration. This means that customers need not create, manage and maintain their own Red Hat OpenShift clusters for Cloud Pak for Integration—they can offload that care and feeding to AWS and Red Hat by using AWS ROSA and spend their time on their business. &nbsp;</p>



 Why Cloud Pak for Integration on ROSA?&nbsp; 



<p>Cloud Pak for Integration is a unified integration solution that is optimized for deployment on Red Hat OpenShift. All the components can be deployed as containers using OpenShift operators to take advantage of Kubernetes container orchestration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Integration products were traditionally deployed as middleware infrastructure. They were complex to build and difficult to deploy and to keep running. Once deployed, the focus was to keep the integrations running unchanged, because each business function that use the integration would be tightly coupled to it and dependent on an unchanging, unmoving deployment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This rigidity led to integrations and the middleware team that support them were seen as the bottlenecks to business innovation. New business opportunities would spawn new or changed applications and the need to access new data in different ways from different systems. But making changes to already running integration deployments was complex and require skills, testing and time. And even then, making changes would risk effects on other parts of the business. &nbsp;Innovations would be impacted and even upgrades to patch problems or security issues would be delayed or postponed because of the risk of change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses need integration to drive innovation, while still being secure, scalable, robust and reliable; but also being agile, automated, simple and seamless. This was the goal for Cloud Pak for Integration: to provide a single integration solution that brings together all integration capabilities that are deployable anywhere within hours, delivering faster innovation with flexibility and efficiency. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud Pak for Integration is also meant to be cloud native. Designed to be deployed in containers on Red Hat OpenShift, whatever you choose to deploy consistently uses Kubernetes Operators that set a standard, powerful deployment approach with workloads that can deploy, run, scale, update and restart independently of each other. This approach removes complexity, while providing maximum flexibility. &nbsp;</p>









<p>&nbsp;<br>Flexibility also applies to the licensing. Purchase Cloud Pak for Integration through a single part and deploy any capability with any capacity into any deployment form-factor. Choose container deployments in OpenShift and run alongside individual integration product deployments in VMs—all entitled through a ratio table to consume your Cloud Pak for Integration entitlement, which gives you one price to pay for all your integration needs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With all possible integration capabilities that are consistently deployable—either in containers or in VMs—it is now simpler than ever to build, deploy, operate and update integrations to meet every business need for a complete end-to-end solution. As more integration instances are needed, or an integration needs to be updated, DevOps can then be used to seamlessly safeguard automated operations. . Workloads can be scaled up to their defined limits of each container and additional container instances can be deployed to meet needs. All defined through configuration of each solution to meet each separate workload need.</p>



<p>Cloud Pak for Integration takes this approach further through automated integration deployment using integration assemblies. An integration assembly provides a single place to define, manage and deploy all the information associated with the integration solution needed. A customer can start with simply the name of the integration and will be guided using opinionated defaults through the creation of MQ, Event Streams, App Connect and API Connect® components. After this step, the customer is then able to deploy and manage all aspects as a single unified object. This definition can be done through a graphical canvas, a webform or directly in YAML.&nbsp;</p>









<p>Once integrations are deployed—when updates or migration to future releases is required— this process is also simplified by using a dedicated migration planning tool to guide each individual deployment through a customized process. Through this process and the container deployments that offer decoupled independent workloads, updates and migration can now be seamless and disruption-free. And your business can focus on the future rather than the past. &nbsp;</p>



 Summary&nbsp; 



<p>With integration being essential to business transformation and agility, Cloud Pak for Integration running on ROSA on AWS offers a highly scalable, secure and resilient deployment environment that is managed for you—with a comprehensive integration solution that allows any of your applications in any environment to connect and exchange data. Automation, AI and the cloud work together to power your business transformation, while making sure your data remains easily accessible and secure and that your business can respond to events without becoming overwhelmed. &nbsp;</p>

DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction.

Practically speaking, it means that the Volume DF payout going forward is ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>(And can rise with higher DCV, all the way to the 112,5000 OCEAN budget for Volume&nbsp;DF.)</p><p>Also, we have retroactively applied this to the DF81 payout by <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">airdropping</a> each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday.</p><p>AMA coming&nbsp;soon!</p> Introduction / Contents of&nbsp;Document <p>The rest of this document describes DF budgets, then zooms in on Volume DF. It describes the “why” of a DCV bound on Volume DF rewards, what OCEAN rewards it led to, and how those numbers improved under Predictoor DF. It describes the bug and the fix, and how the Volume DF rewards changed due to the fix. It describes the issue of violating community expectations somewhat. Finally, it describes the fix: 5x Predictoor Boost, which restores Volume DF Rewards to ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> DF Budgets <p>Overall DF budget. We are in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">Data Farming Main 2 phase</a>, as Mar 14, 2024. From DF Main 1 to DF Main 2, the overall DF budget increased 2x.</p><p>Now, weekly rewards budget is 300,000 OCEAN (plus ROSE for Predictoor DF).</p><p>DF Budgets per Stream. DF is divided into streams. The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> About Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Volume DF is a substream of Ocean Data Farming. In it, users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Volume DF is not Active DF per se; it’s a subset of Active DF. Volume DF is not DF: there are several streams / substreams and it is one of them. Each stream is meaningful on its&nbsp;own.</p> The Wash-Consume Problem, and&nbsp;Fix <p>Early versions of Volume DF encountered a problem: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">wash consume</a>. Let’s explain. Volume DF rewards on DCV. People found a way to game this: publish data assets, then buy &amp; consume those assets themselves. A circular loop that drove up DCV. Volumes ballooned to&nbsp;$Ms.</p><p>This was not real volume, of course. And it is wasteful to reward OCEAN for this behavior. The aim is to reward OCEAN for things that truly drive value ot the ecosystem.</p><p>Here’s how we fixed wash consume: we ensured that rewards paid never exceed $ from fees. This works because fees themselves do not go into the pockets of the wash-consumers. Therefore anyone wash-consuming would lose $. (In Ocean, fees are baseline 0.1%; and baseline 20.1% for Predictoor feeds.)</p><p>The specific implementation is:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise. Call this the “DCV bounds” on the Volume DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This also means that some of the OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF for a given week may not get deployed as rewards for that week. Any OCEAN not rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> How much OCEAN is rewarded to Volume&nbsp;DF? <p>Before Predictoor was rolled out, DCV in Ocean was very small. And DCV_multiplier was 0.1%. So the DCV bounds (small DCV) * (small DCV_multiplier) = negligible number. Therefore OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF was negligible.</p><p>Then Predictoor &amp; Predictoor DF was rolled out, which caused both larger DCV and larger DCV_multiplier of&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Decent DCV. Predictoor came with Predictoor DF, where 37,500 OCEAN is spent as sales to buy Predictoor feeds. This is a “baseline” that incentivizes people to run Predictoor bots. In practice, it’s working extremely well, driving high activity and stake-to-predict volume. Predictoor feeds are the only meaningful contributor to DCV. So, DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Decent DCV_multiplier. Where other feeds had 0.1%, Predictoor feeds&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Let’s combine those: DCV bounds (decent DCV) * (decent DCV_multiplier) = decent-ish number. So, OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF comes out decent-ish.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We apply the formula above: 37,500 OCEAN volume, times DCV_multiplier=20.1% gives a bound of ≈7,500 OCEAN total. Therefore ≈7,500 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>The implementation described above was the intended behavior.</p> Discovery: a bug in DCV-bounds code <p>Thanks to decent DCV and decent DCV_multiplier in Predictoor DF, the Volume DF payout was supposed to be ≈7,500 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>However the payout ended up between ≈20,000-25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>That is, 2.67x-3.33x more OCEAN was being paid out for Volume DF, compared to the intended design of Volume DF. (Remember, this is only a bounds based on DCV of 37,500 OCEAN/week. If DCV was high enough, the full budget of Volume DF would be paid out: 112,500 OCEAN/week.)</p><p>Something was up in Volume DF payout calculations. We dug deeper. As of Fri Mar 15, 2024, we discovered the specific bug in those calculations.</p><p>The bug had applied data consume volume (DCV) bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account during&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Recall that the DCV bound for each asset and each veOCEAN holder: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier. Where “% stake in asset” is the amount of veOCEAN that a user has allocated, compared to the all veOCEAN allocated, for a given&nbsp;asset.</p><p>The bound was supposed to be on a per-asset, per-staker level.</p><p>But, the DCV bound code was written was only on a per-asset level. That was the bug. It missed the per-staker part. That is, “% stake in asset” was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>It meant that a user could create 10 separate accounts with 1/10 of her veOCEAN in each account, and get 10x more rewards compared to a single account. Yes, a Sybil attack. Anyone exploiting this flaw would be rewarded unfairly&nbsp;highly.</p><p>(To be clear: it wasn’t a security issue per se; there were no funds at risk. But it enabled people to game the system and get unfair rewards&nbsp;.)</p> Fixing the bug in DCV-bounds code <p>The core fix was to apply the DCV bound on a per-asset per-staker level. That is, to add the “% stake in asset”&nbsp;term.</p><p>We fixed the bug within hours of finding it. The first payout on the fixed code was for DF81, on Thu Mar 21. The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9">DF81–82 blog post</a> provides further information: in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#a4c1">Section 5</a> (highly detailed); and with a complementary explainer in its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#2693">Appendix</a>.</p><p>The OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF never reduced. However, the amount paid out was reduced, because that payout is bounded by DCV, and DCV hasn’t been high enough to ignore this&nbsp;limit.</p> Bug Fix’s Effect on Volume DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>As expected, accounts doing Volume DF got reduced rewards in DF81&nbsp;payouts.</p><p>Smaller stakers (those with a small % stake on an asset) had larger APY drops than larger stakers. This is because the same DCV bound was (wrongly) only at the per-asset level. Each account saw the same bound. After the bug fix, the APYs should be identical.</p><p>Let us illustrate.</p>  If an asset has just one staker, where % stake = 100%, their Volume DF payout for that asset doesn’t change at all, because the new term “% stake in asset” = 1.0. So introducing it doesn’t change the&nbsp;numbers.  If a larger staker had 50% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 50%, ie a 1/0.5 = 2x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  If a smaller staker had 10% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 10%, ie a 1/0.1 = 10x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  <p>The above APY discussion is all for Volume DF. The APYs on Passive DF are independent; they’re at ≈20% these days. Passive DF APYs were not affected by this fix, since the fix is for Volume DF. Please don’t confuse Passive DF and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p> Bug fixed, but a second issue&nbsp;emerged <p>Like any professional software development team: we identified a bug; we fixed it asap; we deployed it; we communicated the&nbsp;changes.</p><p>However this caused a problem: people had locked OCEAN for years on the basis of seeing historical APYs in Passive DF and Volume DF. A long-term commitment which we appreciate.</p><blockquote>Those expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF.</blockquote><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>At the heart of the problem: Volume DF with the bug was ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN / week. After the bug fix, payout was ≈7,500 OCEAN / week (ie payout of DF81). That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. There were corresponding reductions in Volume DF APYs; those vary per-user as described above.</p> Towards addressing the second&nbsp;issue <p>How can we fix the problem of: expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF?</p><p>To make a specific goal: can we get Volume DF rewards back to at least ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week?</p><p>We have constraints:</p>  It doesn’t make sense to “undo” the bug fix, because then we’d still have the bug, with the issues it&nbsp;entails!  We want to ensure that DF code implementation reflects the intent of its designers (us).  As always, the design of DF and its sub-streams needs to remain flexible enough to keep evolving. All so that OCEAN rewards deployed most effectively drive traction in Ocean, and especially data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).  Related to the last point, some alpha: we do have other Data Farming sub-streams in the works! Those need breathing space. And, Predictoor is growing so the Predictoor DF weekly budget may increase&nbsp;too.   Introducing 5x Predictoor Boost <p>We are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. It is a solution to the problem&nbsp;above.</p><p>Recall:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>Before, Predictoor feeds had DCV_multiplier = 20.1%. 5x Predictoor Boost gives a 5x to this multiplier.</p><p>With 5x Predictoor boost, Predictoor feeds get DCV_multiplier =&nbsp;100.5%.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We haveDCV of 37,500 OCEAN from (due to Predictoor DF), times DCV_multiplier=100.5% gives a bound of 37,687.5 OCEAN total (≈37,500 OCEAN). Therefore 37,687.5 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>(And as DCV rises, up to the whole Volume DF budget of 112,500 OCEAN becomes available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.)</p><p>The 5x boost only applies to the first 37.5K rewards given out on Volume DF. After that, the usual dcv_multiplier=20.1% applies. This helps to ensure breathing space for new DF substreams or increased Predictoor DF&nbsp;budget.</p> Implementation of 5x Predictoor Boost <p>What happens&nbsp;today:</p>  Retroactively apply this new formula to DF81 payout (which was yesterday — Thu Mar 21, 2024). In practice, we have airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">Here’s the&nbsp;tx.</a>  <p>What happens in before next DF&nbsp;payout:</p>  Update the DF payout code to apply the 5x Predictoor boost, for future weeks. (Applicable to first 37.5K&nbsp;rewards)  Update documentation, etc as&nbsp;needed.   Conclusion <p>Due to a bug fix, the Volume DF OCEAN payouts shrunk. Previously, under the bug, payouts were about 20,000–25,000 OCEAN. DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. (APYs for Passive DF and Predictoor DF were not affected.)</p><p>While this was a legitimate bug fix, the drop in reward caused community expectations to be violated somewhat.</p><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>To address this issue, we are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. Practically speaking, it means that the Volume DF payout going forward is ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>(And can rise with higher DCV, all the way to the 112,5000 OCEAN budget for Volume&nbsp;DF.)</p><p>Also, we have retroactively applied this to the DF81 payout by airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday.</p><p>AMA soon!</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>In a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">previous blog</a> in the Data Exfiltration series, we discussed different types of tenant restrictions policy. In this blog, we’ll discuss migrating from tenant restrictions v1 to authentication plane tenant restrictions v2. In future blogs, we’ll discuss migrating to Universal tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions are a vital tool to help prevent data exfiltration from unauthorized access to external Microsoft Entra ID tenants and consumer Microsoft accounts. Tenant restrictions v1 lets you create an allow list of tenant IDs and Microsoft sign-in endpoints to ensure that users access external tenants that your organization authorizes. While tenant restrictions v1 served well for many years, tenant restrictions v2 offers more granularity and easier policy management with no additional licensing requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions v2 has several benefits over tenant restrictions v1. For example, admins can:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Update the policy from the Microsoft Entra portal rather than from each network proxy. There’s no need to update the header.&nbsp; 
  Increase the size limitations of your maximum proxy header length. There’s no limit to the number of partners you can add with tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp; 
  Selectively indicate which user groups access which apps in external tenants rather than allowing entire tenants for all identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll explain the differences between how the two tenant restriction types work independently from, and in tandem with, cross-tenant access settings (outbound) to highlight the benefits of upgrading to tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with tenant restrictions&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions require routing all user authentication traffic through a proxy. Typically, the proxy is the on-premises network egress, but it can also be a cloud-based proxy. The proxy injects a header indicating that an allow list of destinations is enforced on the traffic, regardless of the originating device or network location. In tenant restrictions v1, the destination allow list is in the header. In tenant restrictions v2, the header has a tenant ID and policy ID. Traffic arrives at Microsoft Entra ID, which reads the header and enforces the policy. If the traffic destination isn’t in the allow list, the user receives an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Example of a user getting blocked by tenant restrictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How tenant restrictions v1 works&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of identities: internal and external. Your organization creates and manages internal identities with your identity provider (IdP) but doesn’t manage external identities such as personal accounts or those created by an external organization. Tenant restrictions v1 applies to both account types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagrams, two types of identities (green is internal and black is external) are on the corporate network or connected with a virtual private network (VPN). Both identity types go through the corporate network egress proxy when attempting to access Microsoft 365 services. Typically, both receive the same header injection of allowed destinations. This enforcement has some limitations. If you maintain the allow list in the network proxies, administrators update the header at each proxy when you add or remove a tenant. It’s also important to note that the headers have size limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Tenant restrictions v1 applies to external tenant destinations equally with no user or app granularity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can improve tenant restrictions v1 by adding cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions v1 with outbound cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure the cross-tenant access settings feature to control outbound access on a per-user, per-group, and per-application basis. This policy applies to your internal identities, regardless of device or network location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagram, the users go through the egress proxy. Cross-tenant access settings and tenant restrictions are applied. However, the tenant restrictions v1 allow list is the only policy that applies to external identities. This option improves internal user management, but the architecture has limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both tenant restriction v1 and cross-tenant access settings are evaluated, and the most restrictive policy is applied. However, cross-tenant access settings only apply to internal identities. If you allow access to an external tenant for your users, even with group or application restrictions, you enable all external identities to access any resource in those tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings adds user and app granularity for internal identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restriction v2 with cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restriction v2 works in tandem with cross-tenant access settings. Tenant restriction v2 is a cloud-based policy that applies to external identities. Internal users’ access is controlled by cross-tenant access settings. This separation allows per-user and per-application granularity for internal and external identity scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following example, the organization puts group and application restrictions on their internal identities. However, they can block other external identities from accessing external tenants unless they create exceptions. In this case, an exception is made for Bob from Tenant C. He is allowed access to only Microsoft Exchange so he can check email while on the corporate network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Tenant restrictions v2 adds granular user and app awareness to external identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous diagram demonstrates the flexibility that tenant restrictions v2 offers. Because tenant restrictions v1 and v2 have the same licensing requirements, the one-time migration involves recreating policies and updating the header injection at your network proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more in the tenant restrictions v2 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-migration">migration deployment plan.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance tenant restrictions, learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-universal-tenant-restrictions">Universal tenant restrictions</a>. This feature adds data layer protection and prevents token infiltration that can bypass your corporate network proxy’s tenant restrictions header injection. The feature injects the headers and has a low latency connection to Microsoft 365 resources without needing to hairpin traffic through your corpnet proxies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5G technology isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution that can enable digital transformation at the touch of a button. There are three kinds of 5G, each with its own specific use cases and capabilities, that business leaders need to understand.</p>



<p>5G wireless is broken down into three types—low, mid and high band—named for the spectrum of radio frequencies they support.</p>



 
 Low-band 5G transmits data on frequencies between 600 and 900 MHz 



 Mid-band 5G transmits between 1 and 6 GHz 



 High-band 5G transmits from 24 to 47 GHz. 
 



<p>All major North American carriers, including AT&amp;T, Verizon and Google (and most carriers worldwide) offer all three bands. Before we get into the capabilities each band offers, let’s take a closer look at 5G technology itself, how it works and why enterprises everywhere are interested in its potential.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology</a>, is a new specification for wireless networks developed in 2018 by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3DPP) to guide the development of devices, including smartphones, PCs, tablets and more, that are designed to run on 5G networks.</p>



<p>Like previous wireless technology standards, such as 3G, 4G and 4G LTE, 5G sends and receives data on radio waves. However, due to improvements in latency and bandwidth, 5G networks are capable of much faster upload and download speeds. Some 5G networks’ download speeds can reach as high as 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) making them ideal for new technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/5g-use-cases/">use cases for 5G</a> increase, so does demand for networks that can support the devices that run on it. In North America alone, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">more than 200 million homes currently have access to 5G connection speeds</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) with that number expected to double within the next four years.</p>



 How 5G works 



<p>Like other kinds of wireless networks, 5G technology operates on a geographical area of coverage that is divided up into “cells.” Within each cell, a device like a 5G phone, PC or IoT sensor can connect to the internet via radio waves. This same method of establishing connections was used in previous generations of wireless networks, but with 5G, technological improvements have enabled much faster speeds.</p>



 New RAT standard 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks established by 3DPP in 2018 defines the next generation of radio access technology (RAT) specifications for all 5G mobile networks. Critically, the new RAT released in 2018 opens the 5G spectrum above 6 GHz—frequency bands that were previously not used by cellular devices.</p>



 Network slicing 



<p>Another key development of the 5G rollout in 2018 was the addition of network slicing. 5G offers telecom providers the ability to deploy independent virtual networks in addition to public networks using the same 5G infrastructure. This feature, unique to 5G, gives users more functionality when working remotely while still enabling a high level of security.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>5G-enabled enterprises can create fully private networks with personalization and security features that allow for more control and mobility for their employees across a broad range of use cases.</p>



 How 5G is different than other networks 



<p>5G has been praised for its transformative potential across a number of industries, largely due to the higher frequencies it utilizes and its new capabilities around the swift and secure transfer of large data volumes. Since broadband technology first rolled out in the early 2000s, the amount of data generated by wireless devices has been increasing exponentially. Today, cutting-edge technologies like AI and ML require too much data to run on older networks. 5G devices, on the other hand, are perfectly suited for applications with large data requirements. Here are some key differences between 5G and its predecessors.</p>



 
 Smaller physical footprint:&nbsp;5G transmitters are smaller than those used in 3G, 4G and 4G LTE networks, and the small cells that coverage areas are divided up into require less power. 



 Improved error rates:&nbsp;5G deployment relies on an adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), a schematic for transmitting data that’s far more powerful than the schemes used in 3G and 4G networks. As a result, 5G’s Block Error Rates (BER)—the frequency of errors on its networks—are much lower. 



 Better bandwidth:&nbsp;By using a broader range of radio frequencies than previous generations of networks, 5G can support more devices on its networks at once. 



 Low latencies:&nbsp;5G’s lower <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>—a measurement of the time it takes data to move between devices on the network—makes activities like playing video games, downloading a file or working in the cloud much faster than on other types of wireless networks.

<p>Here’s a closer look at the three types of 5G networks and why businesses should consider them. &nbsp;</p>



 Low-band&nbsp;5G 



<p>Low-band 5G operates on frequencies between 600 and 900 MHz, very near to the frequencies of TV and radio stations. While not “lightning-fast” by any means, these frequencies are still considerably faster than 4G speeds—up to 10 times in some instances—and are capable of traveling long distances and covering large areas. For users willing to sacrifice speed for reach, low-band 5G is a great option.</p>



 Mid-band 5G 



<p>While faster than low band, mid-band 5G still isn’t capable of reaching the speeds required by cutting-edge applications like AI, ML and IoT. Mid-band 5G operates on frequencies ranging from 1 to 6 GHz, which gives it more capacity to move bigger volumes of data, but not over a large area. One important consideration for enterprises seeking to leverage mid-band 5G networks is the fact that buildings and other solid structures can interfere with connectivity, especially at the higher end of its bandwidth.</p>



 High-band 5G 



<p>High-band 5G can’t travel very far but is capable of delivering the lightning-fast speeds that 5G’s most exciting applications demand. High-band 5G sets the gold standard for many transformative technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and smarter cities. Much of this vaunted speed and performance is due to 5G’s millimeter waves (mmWave) technology, a particular spectrum between 30 and 300 GHz.</p>



 
 Millimeter waves (wwWave): mmWaves’ use cases are slightly different than other kinds of 5G networks and include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a>, streaming video and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ar-vr-workplace">augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR)</a> that require higher speeds and performance than the low-band spectrum and mid-band 5G networks can offer. While mmWave 5G is superior to other types of 5G in terms of speed and performance, it suffers from the same limitations when it comes to line-of-sight interruptions. For example, buildings, dense foliage and even heavy rain can impede 5G mmWave connections. 



 Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS): To cope with some of the line-of-sight problems that higher band 5G frequencies have, some carriers deploy 5G on the same frequencies typically used with 4G mobile phones and devices. Dynamic spectrum sharing, or DSS technology as it’s known, allows organizations to achieve 5G speeds without replacing their existing infrastructure. 
 



 5G capabilities and standards 



<p>In addition to its speed, 5G technology is safer and more reliable than previous generations of wireless networks, enabling new features and benefits that enterprises of all kinds should consider.</p>



 
 Ultra-reliable low-latency communications: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications, or URLLC, is a new communications capability that was specifically designed to support the latency and reliability requirements of IoT and other high-demand applications that run on 5G networks. With URLLC, communication speeds are instantaneous no matter where two parties are physically located. URLLC enables tasks as wide-ranging as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> and remote vehicle operation to gaming with AR/VR headsets. 



 Enhanced mobile broadband: Enhanced mobile broadband, or eMBB technology, is a new standard for 5G services that enhances bandwidth and decreases latency when compared to 4G. Developed by 3GPP as part of its 5G NR standard, the eMBB guidelines serve to increase data rates, bandwidth and throughput across 5G networks, improving a wide range of media services. Applications covered under the eMBB standard include video streaming, gaming and AR/VR operations. 



 Massive machine type communications: Massive machine type communications, or mMTC, is another standard that 3GPP rolled out as part of its 5G NR guidelines to deal specifically with services and applications that utilize IoT technology. mMTC typically covers a network architecture designed for high-speed, low-latency communications between a large number of IoT devices and/or machines on a single network. Examples of mMTC include smart transportation networks, smart factories and smart energy grids. 
 



 5G use cases 



<p>Because of its speed, latency requirements and reliability, 5G is fast becoming one of the most talked-about enabler technologies available today. From driverless cars to smart energy grids to remote operating rooms, here are some of the most exciting developments 5G is making possible:</p>



 
 Autonomous vehicles: From taxis and drones to pilotless airplanes, 5G is behind some of the most advanced designs in autonomous vehicles. Until 5G, driverless cars were a bit of a pipe dream due to data requirements that previous wireless network standards couldn’t meet. Today, 5G’s connection speeds are enabling breakthroughs in the remote or self-driving operation of cars, trains, planes and more. 



 Smart factories: 5G, along with AI, ML and IoT technology, is making factories safer, smarter and more efficient thanks to breakthroughs in everything from fuel economy and equipment repair to remotely operated cameras that help prevent theft and make workplaces safer. For example, in a busy warehouse, drones and cameras connected via IoT that operates on a 5G network can assist in locating and transporting goods faster and more efficiently than human employees—and with less of a carbon footprint. 



 Smart cities: Hyper-connected urban environments are starting to rely on 5G network to spur innovation in areas like law enforcement, waste disposal and disaster mitigation. Some cities use 5G-enabled sensors to track traffic patterns in real-time and adjust signals to alter the flow, minimize congestion and improve air quality. Additionally, 5G power grids monitor supply and demand across heavily populated areas and deploy AI and ML applications to “learn” what times energy is in high or low demand. 



 Smart healthcare: The healthcare industry has been one of the biggest and earliest beneficiaries of 5G connection speeds. One example is the area of remote surgery that uses robotics and a high-definition live stream connected to the internet via a 5G network. Another is mobile health, where 5G allows medical workers in the field to quickly and securely access patient records, enabling faster, more informed decisions with the potential to save lives. Finally, during the pandemic, 5G-enabled contact tracing and the mapping of outbreaks played a big role in keeping people safe. 



 Edge computing: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge computing</a>, a computing framework that allows computations to be done closer to data sources, is fast becoming the standard for businesses that consider data processing to be one of their core competencies. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">this Gartner white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge (compared to only 10% today). This shift, powered by 5G connectivity and speed, saves businesses time and money and enables better control over large volumes of data.

 As the Brazilian igaming market prepares for lift off, we discuss regulatory surprises, the challenges of encouraging players to leave the black market, and the feasibility of Brazil becoming the largest gambling market in the world. 



 



<p>Although at first glance, there may not appear to be a huge amount in common between the Brazilian aviation industry and the Brazilian gambling industry, for lawyer Neil Montgomery, there are parallels that gambling operators would be well served to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Late last year, the Brazilian online gambling industry took significant steps toward regulation, when Law No. 14,790/2023 was enacted further addressing fixed odds sports betting and igaming. While last month’s departure of <a href="https://www.telecomasia.net/news/other/mansurundefineds-resignation-could-impact-launch-of-bets-in-brazil/">government chief advisor, Jose Francisco Mansur</a>, is likely to result in considerable delays to the licensing process, it will not dampen the appetite for the official launch of a fully regulated gambling market in Brazil at federal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The excitement and anticipation for a regulated market at federal level (since some Brazilian states – like Paraná and Rio de Janeiro – have already made state licenses available) is borne largely from two things: the federal government realizing it is missing out on significant tax revenue, and Brazilian players being able to benefit from a safer and more secure player experience that only a regulated platform can offer. However, Neil does warn that unless gambling operators take the necessary steps to become ‘regulation-ready,’ including adherence to KYC, identity verification, and responsible gambling measure requirements, there is likely to be trouble ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer legislation is strict and strictly enforced in Brazil so foreign operators are going to have to confront the nightmare of doing business when it comes to consumer claims.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neil explains that Brazil is infamously ranked number one in the world in terms of airline passenger claims. The reason, he suggests, is that although Brazil complies with international conventions on the limitation of carrier liability, said conventions do not apply to so-called ‘moral damages,’ or the pain and suffering inflicted on the passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe a similar situation will repeat itself in the gaming industry because disgruntled consumers will now have a local door to knock on and use the Brazilian courts to obtain favourable awards. Brazilian courts will look at sports betting and igaming operators as wealthy companies and an expectation for companies to compensate damages cost to consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Neil explains all about consumer legislation, tax, KYC, and why Brazilian gambling operators may have the upper hand on their stronger foreign counterparts.</p>



 Now that Brazilian regulations for sports betting and online casinos have passed, was there anything in the final draft that surprised you, positively or negatively? Is there anything you would like to see revised in future iterations? 



<p>Well, I think that in general terms, it was very positive. We had to wait until the very last minute in 2023 to see the law passed because there was a lot of discussion as to whether this was coming out this year or not. The federal government, of course, was focused on getting it passed since it has an objective of reaching zero tax deficit in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any additional revenue is welcome and of course the sports, betting and gaming markets are seen as a very good source of additional revenues. For this revenue to be included in the 2024 budget, everything had to be passed in 2023. A positive surprise was the inclusion of igaming in the law because it was originally only supposed to govern fixed odd sports betting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Brazilian law, we still need to wait and see what the Ministry of Finance will do with its many ordinances. There are 12 expected to be released, and we’ll see what the definition of igaming is. Another surprise was the fact that operators will need to have 20% Brazilian ownership. However, the way it is worded was a bit ambiguous because it doesn’t explicitly refer to a Brazilian individual and so adopting a two-tier corporate structure in Brazil (where the foreign operator would first incorporate a local holding company and have that company incorporate the local operator applying for the license – the latter thereby having a 100% Brazilian shareholder). The other positive was player tax being reduced from the initially proposed 30% to 15%. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There were certain paragraphs vetoed by President Lula, such as the player having to calculate income tax on net winnings on an annual basis. All vetoes are still to be heard at Congress, and there’s a lot of uncertainty as to how the income tax is going to be calculated and collected.</p>



 Have you noticed a surge in interest or activity among Brazilian gaming operators since it passed? 



<p>Well, there are very few Brazilian operators because most of them are all foreign operators that will now have to set up shop in Brazil to obtain a federal licence. For many years, players have been used to playing on offshore platforms. Upcoming law changes will make the experience of using an unlicensed platform much harder. For example, there will be restrictions on advertising and on payment methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign operators will therefore have to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Finance and players will have to play only on licenced operators in Brazil. Right now, we’re in a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/"> grey market</a> until the full legal framework is laid out, but from the moment licences are made available at federal level, it will officially become a black market, and will be considered significantly riskier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will always be ways of circumventing the regulated market, but I think it’s going to be more cumbersome for them to be able to play in the black market. So, hopefully the ordinances will allow a balance between what operators need to do, what the players need to do, and what the government needs to do so that the new regulated market will be sufficiently attractive to encourage players to bet in a licenced environment.</p>

 With many Brazilian players already familiar with gambling on the grey market, how ready and willing do you think players will be to switch to regulated, domestic platforms, where they will be required to complete a KYC process and follow tax payments? 



<p>It all depends on how easy it is to operate in the regulated market. I think there’s still some uncertainties regarding how the tax will be calculated and collected. I think if they had published the methodology of how the player’s income tax will be calculated then that would have been very positive in terms of encouraging players to place their bets in the domestic market. We just need to wait and see what happens. However, if the legal framework is more time and cost consuming than continuing to place bets on the black market, then of course we’re going to have channelization issues, which of course the federal government would like to avoid. Also, will the regulations leave enough room to guarantee the return on investment, because the licence fee is going to be quite high: 30 million Brazilian Reals, which is about $6 million for a 5-year licence. That puts Brazil as one of the most expensive places in the world to obtain a licence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, of course, let’s not forget the real reason for regulating the market, which is player protection and investment protection, so hopefully the balance will be found to avoid players continuing to place their bets on the black market.</p>



 Brazil is forecast to become the largest gambling market in the world. Do you see any obstacles in its way to achieving that? 



<p>Well, I’m an eternal optimist, so if a good balance can be found, which will require all stakeholders to make concessions, then I think so. In Brazil, professional football depends massively on sponsorship provided by operators, and there has been an increase in the value of sponsorship over the years and now that the law has passed, I have seen the amounts go up quite significantly. It’s likely to lower again at some point in the future, but right now sponsorship amounts are record-breaking, and every week we receive news that a football club is receiving twice, three times the amount of sponsorship of previous deals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there’s a lot of appetite for Brazil to become the largest gambling market in the world, and I think it will generate a lot of jobs, a lot of investment, but we need to find the balance. This is the key issue; we are in a newly regulated market and everything’s new for everyone. This is the big opportunity we have been waiting decades for, and now is the time to get it right.</p>



 As a lawyer, what is your opinion of the Brazil licensing requirements? Too arduous, too many loopholes, or to be expected? 



<p>Well, the law has been framed in a way that if an operator doesn’t obtain a licence, they’re going to be subject to many restrictions to access the Brazilian market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Brazilian federal government has always said that once licences are made available then they are going to enforce legislation. We have seen at state level many enforcement actions by certain states, especially Rio Janeiro and Paraná, because not only do we have the federal licence regime, but we also have state licences because federal legislation has taken so long to be enacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2020, states have enacted their own legislation to grant state licences for traditional lottery and for fixed odd sports betting, as fixed odd sports betting was legalized in Brazil as a form of lottery, and we have seen many clients of ours receive notices and subpoenas as they have not obtained a state licence. One of the main problems we have is of the legal problems caused by the dichotomy between federal and state licences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re awaiting the official licencing requirements. We only have the main points in the law. So, we know it’s an open licencing model with no limit on the number of licences issued, which is good, that’s the model I have been advocating for many years. We know it’s going to cost 30 million Brazilian Reals for a five-year licence, and each operator can promote up to three brands, and not necessarily the operator’s own brand, so there could be licencing arrangements with other brand holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan is to have two windows per year during which the applications can be filled. 134 companies submitted applications last year, well, submitted an expression of interest and the federal government has promised priority in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hopefully the Ministry of Finance will have sufficient human resources to process all these applications, because they are going to be flooded with a lot of paperwork. Everything is going to be done electronically, which should be more efficient, but there’s going to be a lot of documents that need to be provided. We still do not know whether documents coming from overseas will have to satisfy the formalities of notarization. It’s going to be the first experience in Brazil in terms of licencing at federal level, but hopefully we’ll get there!&nbsp;</p>



 In your legal opinion, how well-prepared are Brazilian operators, particularly start-ups, to navigate the complexities of the new regulatory landscape in the online gambling sector? 



<p>Well, there’s going to be a surge in igaming lawyers in all aspects of the law, because this is a very detailed, regulatory environment. So, there are many different aspects to it. So, I think Brazilian operators may have an advantage of knowing the law better, and how it could evolve with upcoming regulations, as they know the market so well. Maybe they don’t have the strength that foreign operators have, but at least they have the knowledge of the local market and knowledge of the local law, which should give them a certain competitive advantage. Foreign operators who set up shop in Brazil will gradually have to learn their way around the treacherous waters of the Brazilian legal system because, as we say, Brazil is not for amateurs.</p>



 With other countries in the Americas opening, such as Peru, how important do you think the region will become in the global gambling market in the next 5 to 10 years? Is the future bright? 



<p>I think Latin America is the new frontier of the gaming industry. So, most of it is still uncharted territory, especially Brazil, but I think things will become clearer with time. But, yes, Latin America is the place to be at the moment and I think we’ll be in the spotlight for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have seen other surprise advancements, even in the Muslim world, with land-based casinos being floated in the UAE for example, and even places like Saudi Arabia are now considering casinos. So, I think igaming is seen as something that needs to be focused on and Latin America, Mexico, all the way down to Argentina and Chile are going to be in the spotlight with Brazil likely to become the main player in that regional market.</p>

Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  5.1 Summary <p>This week, we discovered and fixed a bug in Volume DF. It applied DCV bounds too loosely. We’ve fixed it now. Accounts doing Volume DF should expect reduced rewards from DF81 payouts&nbsp;onwards.</p> 5.2 Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/">df-py</a> is the GitHub repo implementing DF rewards formulae. The issue is in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/issues/821">df-py issue #821</a>; we bring relevant info&nbsp;here</p><p>Here is the main formula for Volume DF rewards, before the fix. It’s from df-py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/blob/cca4665cfb0670d23b67767ce6e724c56be338e3/df_py/volume/reward_calculator.py#L182C1-L205C18">reward_calculator.py</a>.</p> R[i, j] = min(<br>    perc_at_j * perc_at_ij * self.OCEAN_avail,<br>    ocean_locked_ij * TARGET_WPY,  # bound rewards by max APY<br>    DCV_OCEAN_j * multiplier,  # bound rewards by DCV<br>) <p>R[i,j] is the reward amount in OCEAN, for user i and asset&nbsp;j.</p><p>Inside the min() function, the first term is the baseline reward amount. The second &amp; third terms bound by max APY and DCV respectively. The problem is in the third term with DCV_OCEAN_j.</p><p>If DCV is sufficiently low that Volume DF rewards should be bounded it (typical), and if Alice splits her veOCEAN across 2 accounts, then Alice will get more rewards compared to if a single account. This is incorrect behavior.</p><p>We can tell that this happens in the DCV_OCEAN_j line, because it’s only a function of j and not of i as&nbsp;well.</p> 5.3 Problem with Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <blockquote>The # rewards that Alice gets should only be a function of how much veOCEAN Alice has, not whether she has one account or two (or&nbsp;100).</blockquote><p>The bug exposed Volume DF to Sybil attacks: Alice got 2x more reward than she was supposed to for having 2 accounts. If she had 100 accounts, she would have got 100x more (up to where the asset-level DCV bounds kicked in). In other words, Volume DF over-rewarded each individual address.</p><p>It also meant that each account got over-rewarded, since they were only bounded by DCV of the asset, not by their pro-rata stake in the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>This was the case since asset-level DCV bounds were introduced: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">DF23</a> on Feb 2,&nbsp;2023.</p> 5.4 Reproducing the&nbsp;Problem <p>The following code exposes the issue, in test form. The first test is for one account; the second is for two accounts. It should have rewarded the same total OCEAN (50) whether there was one account, or&nbsp;two.</p> def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_1accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 1e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 50.0}<br><br>def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_2accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 0.5e6, user2_addr: 0.5e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 25.0, user2_addr: 25.0} <p>We had the first test before, and it passed. Whereas the newly-introduced second test failed. In it, of the two accounts got 50 OCEAN, for 50+50 = 100 OCEAN total. Correct would have been 25+25 = 50 OCEAN&nbsp;total.</p><p>This is good news: we had reproduced the issue in reproducible tests. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-936f12da0a54dc6256a4ffd1e8418c94405af8f70bb269a34a6cbf968d88528c">Here’s the PR</a>; the code shown is modified slightly for readability.</p> 5.5 The Fix to the&nbsp;Problem <p>Here’s the change in code. The “before” line in red didn’t properly bound rewards. The “after” line in green does. The main fix was just one line. (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-afc4732bb19ebf7622890387838941eddb3d67d74dee5cd6dc7127a6fe889a7f">Here’s the&nbsp;PR</a>.)</p>Red = before the fix, green = after the fix. DCV bounds are now scaled by the user’s proportion of rewards, perc_at_ij.<p>The specific fix is: the DCV bounds need to also scale by the account’s proportion of stake in the asset, perc_at_ij. Like all proportions, 0 &lt;=perc_at_ij ≤&nbsp;1.</p><p>With the fix in place, the previously-failing test now passed.&nbsp;Great!</p> 5.6 How does this affect users going&nbsp;forward? <blockquote>In previous rounds, accounts were being over-rewarded in Volume DF because it wasn’t properly bounding on&nbsp;DCV.</blockquote><blockquote>Accounts can expect the proper amount of reward now, from DF81 payouts onwards. It is almost certainly less than&nbsp;before.</blockquote><p>Here’s why one should expect less rewards in Volume DF. The additional term perc_at_ij in the rewards line has value between 0 and 1, and is rarely 1 because one user rarely has all the&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In other words, there’s an OCEAN reward allocated for a given asset (based on its DCV compared to other assets), and that reward is spread among different accounts (based on their relative stakes in the&nbsp;asset).</p> 5.7 Final Clarifications <p>Just to say it: we won’t retroactively reduce any rewards. For starters, even trying would be pretty uncool! Second, it’s not very pragmatic to implement.</p><p>Also, this only affects Volume DF rewards. There is no change to Passive DF Rewards, or to Predictoor DF&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>It’s also not a security vulnerability. Yes it was a Sybil attack, but in this case it means that a person could Sybil-attack to take comparatively more rewards for themselves. Emphatically, it was not a security bug: there were no funds at risk, and there were no funds&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>UPDATE: one day after we published this post, we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-5x-predictoor-boost-in-volume-data-farming-c9a93b33b928">5x Predictoor Boost</a> to restore Volume DF reward&nbsp;levels.</p> Appendix: Bug Fix Explainer <p>This subsection describes the bug fix changes end-to-end, in a different voice.</p><p>You may see see a significant drop in your Volume DF rewards this week. This is indeed the correct behavior after the bug&nbsp;fix.</p><p>Let’s elaborate. We discovered a bug that gave more rewards payout for Volume DF than the design intent. We fixed the bug within hours of discovery. With the bug fixed, users will see a sizeable drop in Volume DF payout compared to previous weeks. Although this drop is large, the code is updated with the correct functionality that Volume DF rewards were supposed to have all&nbsp;along.</p><p>Here’s that rewards&nbsp;logic:</p>  asset X generates data consume volume&nbsp;DCV.  then, Volume DF rewards for asset X are either DCV_multiplier= 20.1% (Predictoor feeds) or 0.1% other&nbsp;assets).  those asset rewards for are divided among veOCEAN holders who allocated veOCEAN to this asset, according to their stake. This is where delegations get counted&nbsp;too.  <p>Then, repeat the above for each of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Realistically, there is only volume on Predictoor feeds. So DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500 OCEAN. Multiplying the 37,500 OCEAN times 20.1% for Predictoor feeds means about 7,500 OCEAN. The remaining 37,500–7,500=30,000 OCEAN that was budgeted for Volume DF goes back into the Data Farming pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Unveiling a New&nbsp;Era <p>In our digital age, the management of digital identities has become a critical concern. Traditional centralized systems, managed by entities like Google and Facebook, often fall short in safeguarding user privacy and security. This introduces Decentralized Identity (DID), a paradigm shift that promises not just a technological revolution but a cultural transformation, emphasizing digital independence and security.</p><p>The evolution of identity management from centralized to decentralized models, with DID at the helm, marks a significant departure from the status quo. Initially, online identification relied on methods like emails and passwords, with enhancements such as WebAuthn bolstering user authentication. However, these centralized systems presented considerable privacy and security vulnerabilities, leading to an urgent call for a new approach. DID, utilizing blockchain technology, represents this new frontier. By empowering users with control over their personal data, DID ensures privacy and enhances security, heralding a new era of digital interactions that prioritize user autonomy.</p><p>This shift to DID introduces numerous benefits:</p>  Streamlined Verification: Simplifies the authentication process, allowing for safe and efficient identity&nbsp;checks.  Enhanced Security: By distributing data across a decentralized network, DID minimizes the risks associated with centralized data&nbsp;storage.  Greater Privacy: Users control their personal information, sharing only what’s necessary and with whom they&nbsp;choose.  Reduced Data Breaches: The decentralized nature and encryption methods lower the potential for large-scale data breaches.  <p>Blockchain technology underpins DID’s advantages, providing a decentralized framework that transforms personal data management. This not only secures information through encryption but also assures data integrity, as altering recorded information requires network consensus. Blockchain’s role is pivotal in overcoming the limitations of centralized systems, offering a verification mechanism that bolsters trust without compromising privacy.</p><p>As we look towards a future shaped by these advancements, DID stands as a beacon for a user-centric digital ecosystem. This evolution from centralized control to decentralized empowerment signifies more than technological progress; it marks a shift towards a digital existence where privacy, security, and user autonomy are paramount. The journey towards this future, driven by blockchain’s innovative capabilities, promises to redefine digital identity management, ensuring a more secure, transparent, and empowering online&nbsp;world.</p><p>In conclusion, the move to decentralized identity systems is not merely a response to the shortcomings of centralized models but a forward-looking vision for a digital society grounded in autonomy and trust. As this paradigm shift unfolds, DID emerges not just as a technological solution but as a cornerstone for a future where digital interactions are rooted in empowerment and transparency, reshaping our digital lives in profound ways. This transition to a decentralized framework marks a pivotal moment in our collective digital journey, promising a more secure, private, and user-centric online experience.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/basics-and-importance-of-decentralized-identity-56098fd64fe5">Basics and Importance of Decentralized Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA), in conjunction with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), recently released its “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3699169/nsa-releases-top-ten-cloud-security-mitigation-strategies/">Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies</a>” for organizations to make their cloud environments more secure. The report contains a Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI) for each strategy, which includes MITRE ATT&amp;CK and D3FEND mappings and cloud-specific mitigation guidance.</p>  
<p>The agency emphasizes that these measures are critical for every company that uses cloud services as these environments are increasingly targeted by malicious cyber actors (MCAs). Earlier this year, the NSA, CISA and a host of international cybersecurity agencies <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3686651/russian-cyber-actors-target-cloud-hosted-infrastructure/">issued a joint advisory</a> analyzing the way that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are evolving their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to focus on initial access and disruption of cloud services. The new guidance provides mitigation strategies to counter these threats.</p> 
<p>Full strategy list:</p> 
  
  Uphold the cloud shared responsibility model  
  Use secure cloud identity and access management practices  
  Use secure cloud key management practices  
  Implement network segmentation and encryption in cloud environments  
  Secure data in the cloud  
  Defending continuous integration/continuous delivery environments&nbsp;  
  Enforce secure automated deployment practices through infrastructure as code  
  Account for complexities introduced by hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments  
  Mitigate risks from managed service providers in cloud environments&nbsp;  
  Manage cloud logs for effective threat hunting  
  
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #1: Cloud Security Starts With Identity Security&nbsp;  
<p>Much of the guidance centers on having a robust identity security program. Insufficiently secure identity systems leave organizations exposed to any number of threats including phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks, identity fraud, MFA bombing attacks and more. Last year saw a 71% spike in cyberattacks that exploited stolen or compromised credentials, according to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">2024 threat report</a>, accounting for 30% of attacks. The report also revealed that 90% of the cloud assets for sale on the dark web were cloud account credentials.</p> 
 Phishing-Resistant MFA Is No Longer Optional  
<p>Two of the top strategies directly relate to secure identity practices, and several others on the list call out the need to protect credentials and the threat posed by passwords and shared secrets. Specifically, the guidance recommends the use of phishing-resistant MFA as widely as possible. It defines phishing resistant methods as FIDO standards based public key cryptography or PKI-based CAC/PIV cards, pointing to the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">phishing-resistant MFA fact sheet</a> issued earlier by CISA.</p> 
<p>Example of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow:</p> 
<p></p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #2: Context Is King  
<p>Multiple measures in the guidance emphasize the need for detailed contextual information about the system’s activity and behavior. This data is critical to govern access and drive appropriate and timely responses to potential threats. For example, the report highlights the need for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/context-based-authentication-to-improve-security">context-based authentication</a>, using conditions such as geo location</p> 
<p>The effectiveness of such context-based access controls depends on the fidelity of the information flow, which in turn depends on monitoring risk from a wide variety of sources. Ideally, an organization’s cloud identity control systems would leverage the same risk data being collected for threat hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #3: Minimize Complexity  
<p>Before rolling out MFA and other cloud security solutions, it's crucial to fully understand the range of scenarios they'll be used in. The NSA guidance cautions against an uncoordinated approach, which can leave gaps in coverage and create complexity. Using multiple IAM systems and different authenticators can create confusion for users and hinder adoption. It also makes it harder to manage and monitor security effectively.</p> 
<p>This becomes especially critical in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Attackers move back and forth between on-prem and cloud environments. The guidance recommends the organizations implement identity solutions that can unify disparate systems and support all of their use cases. Authentication protocols should follow the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST SP 800-63 </a>Digital Identity Guidelines.</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #4: Embrace Zero Trust Principles  
<p>Whether you’re of the camp that Zero Trust is a marketing buzzword, or if it’s your guiding north star, the principles behind Zero Trust are solid security best practices. A Zero Trust approach makes data, systems, and networks harder for attackers to compromise in the first place, and slows them down if they do manage to get a foothold.&nbsp; Much of the NSA Cloud Security guidance is, in effect, Zero Trust tenets made actionable, starting with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> and least-privilege access control, to strong cryptographic protocols and network segmentation. Implicit in all of the guidance is to bake in Zero Trust best practices as you migrate to the cloud. It’s harder to re-architect already established systems, especially if there is not adequate segregation of duties. For example, your authentication systems should be separate from your IdP.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>The NSA recommendation for phishing-resistant MFA stands out as one of the simplest yet most effective strategies. Until now, it's been the high-stakes sectors like financial services, insurance, and critical infrastructure leading the charge in adopting phishing-resistant controls. The NSA guidance makes clear that it’s time for security teams across the board to catch up. Here are some things to keep in mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Prioritize a consistent experience. Users want a simple login process that is the same across cloud systems and resources as well as other channels. Employ independent, phishing-resistant authentication controls that work with multiple identity sources to provide a uniform experience.  
  Take a phased approach. Start with critical systems and high-risk users to minimize disruption and maximize impact. As you troubleshoot and succeed, gradually extend the approach to wider systems and user groups.  
  Beware of FIDO imitators. There is a vast difference between "FIDO-like" or "FIDO-compliant" and "FIDO Certified." Verify vendors' certifications on the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO website</a>, ensuring all solution components, authenticators and servers, are certified.  
  
 How Organizations Can Meet NSA Cloud Security Provisions  
<p>The new guidance from NSA underscores the critical role identity plays in fortifying cloud security defenses. With malicious actors increasingly targeting cloud environments, and specifically identity systems, following recommended best practices becomes indispensable. The rapid <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">weaponization of generative AI</a> in attacks makes this even more critical.</p>

<p>If you’re an IAM (Identity and Access Management) manager in a small or medium-sized business, you know the challenge of trying to secure a growing ecosystem of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. Every day, there’s a new app that one of your employees must have, and it’s your job to ensure access is granted quickly, consistently, and securely. But with each new app, the risks of inconsistent access management grows. Is there a way to solve this challenge? Of course, there is. Why else would I be writing this and you reading it?</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<p>Many apps can’t be easily integrated into your IAM system. The apps might support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), but that’s often locked behind an expensive “Enterprise” tier. And even if you can afford it, automated provisioning requires SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), which is even less commonly supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCIM is an open standard that defines a schema for exchanging user identity information between systems. It allows IAM systems to automate the provisioning, de-provisioning, and management of user accounts in SaaS apps, ensuring that access is always in sync with the user’s current role and employment status.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without SCIM, IAM managers are forced to rely on manual processes and custom integrations to manage SaaS app access. As your team and SaaS portfolio grow, these manual processes become increasingly unsustainable and error-prone.</p>
 The Challenge: SaaS App Sprawl and Access Management Complexity 
<p>So what do you do? Many fall back on spreadsheets and a patchwork of playbooks to try to keep up. But this approach has serious risks – and the risks get worse as you add more apps and more people with varying access needs and roles. This perfect storm of complexity spirals out of control, leading to inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance issues.</p>
 The Risks of Inconsistent Access Management 
<p>When onboarding and offboarding processes vary from app to app, it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Imagine a new sales rep who starts work excited to dive in and close some deals, only to find they can’t access the CRM because their account hasn’t been provisioned. Or consider the IT team that thinks they’ve completed an employee’s offboarding, only to discover weeks later that the ex-employee still has access to sensitive data in a cloud storage app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These inconsistencies not only frustrate employees and waste time they also create serious security risks that compound with each new app.</p>
 The Dangers of Access Creep 
<p>Then there’s the access creep. As employees move between roles, their permissions don’t always keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ex-engineer Al Sutton revealed that despite quitting 18 months ago he still retained access to Twitter’s central file store on GitHub, a website used by software developers to store source code.” — <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/08/24/ex-twitter-staff-have-access-secret-software-code-whistleblower/#:~:text=Ex%2Dengineer%20Al%20Sutton%20revealed%20that%20despite%20quitting%2018%20months%20ago%20he%20still%20retained%20access%20to%20Twitter%27s%20central%20file%20store%20on%20GitHub%2C%20a%20website%20used%20by%20software%20developers%20to%20store%20source%20code.">The Telegraph</a></p>
<p>Consider a tech startup that uses GitHub Teams to manage their code repositories. When an engineer leaves the company, their GitHub account isn’t always immediately deprovisioned from the company’s GitHub organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the IT team is busy or forgets to follow up, the ex-employee could retain access to critical codebases, infrastructure-as-code templates, and other sensitive IP long after they’ve left. This lingering access is a major security risk even if the engineer has no malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If the engineer’s personal GitHub account is ever compromised, hackers could then gain access to the company’s crucial assets. As your company grows and more employees cycle through, the risk of this happening increases.</p>
 The Danger of Poor Visibility 
<p>Perhaps most concerning is the lack of visibility into user permissions across SaaS apps. Even with an IAM system in place, the lack of automation makes it impossible to fully track and manage access across all SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider an auditor who asks to see a report of everyone who has admin access to your financial systems. If those permissions are managed in a spreadsheet or worse, in someone’s head, you’re going to have a tough time pulling that report together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you can’t confidently prove who has access to what, you risk failing the audit and losing out on big deals with security-conscious customers. Achieving SOC2 compliance with inconsistent access management is a daunting task that only gets harder as your SaaS ecosystem expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even if you’re not pursuing SOC2 compliance, put yourself in your customers’ shoes: would you buy a product from a company that can’t even track something as basic as what their employees have access to?</p>
<p>The longer you wait to address these issues, the more entrenched and intractable they become. That’s why it’s critical to implement a solution now, before your SaaS environment grows too complex to manage.</p>
 The Solution: Centralized IAM Playbooks 
<p>By bringing all your access management processes together in one place – including manual steps, automated workflows, and everything in between – you can ensure consistent, timely execution of access changes across all your apps, now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You gain a single pane of glass to monitor and manage permissions. And you can easily generate the reports you need to breeze through your next compliance audit, no matter how many SaaS apps you’ve added to your stack.</p>
 Why Legacy IAM Falls Short 
<p>But not all IAM solutions are up to this task. Legacy IAM systems often lack the flexibility and extensibility needed to implement truly centralized playbooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might handle the basics of single sign-on and provisioning, yet struggle to accommodate the custom workflows and manual steps that are a reality of life with SaaS apps, especially as your app portfolio diversifies.</p>

<p>With the turn of the 20th century and the rise of the internet, transactions and services became increasingly digital – and so did our identities. Unlike physical identities where a person is in complete control of their identification documents and knows when these documents are missing or stolen, digital identities are stored on servers and databases owned by third-party vendors that offer their services in a digital format. So, it’s highly unlikely a person would know when their digital identity is stolen or compromised. In effect, a cybercriminal could pose as a legitimate user and inflict financial and reputational damage over a long period of time before the breach is detected.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and digital transformation has accelerated over the last few years, so has application sprawl, with the average company having over 254 SaaS apps, and less than half of those being used on a regular basis, according to a Productiv study. And an average mobile phone user has 80 apps installed, with 62% of those apps not used on a regular basis, according to a DataProt study. This SaaS sprawl has led to password fatigue and reuse as well as dormant accounts, increasing the attack surface for cybercriminals to launch successful identity-based attacks. It’s no wonder that phishing and credential compromise are the two most common initial attack vectors.</p>
<p>Taking a layered approach to identity-first security</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI technologies and criminal SaaS offerings such as phishing as a service that enable cybercriminals to launch effective and targeted phishing campaigns, identity has quickly become the perimeter that organizations need to secure against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In order to build an effective identity-first security strategy, organizations need to take a layered approach to a proactive defense – starting with an effective AI-based biometric solution to verify identities accurately while detecting fake IDs and deepfakes.</p>
<p>Then, enabling high assurance phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless authentication</a> (e.g., certificate-based authentication with passkeys) can help authenticate seamlessly while protecting against phishing and MFA-bypass attacks.</p>
<p>You can further eliminate the dangers that come with SaaS application sprawl and password fatigue&nbsp;by implementing a true passwordless experience with <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/single-sign-on">single sign-on (SSO)</a> and just-in-time user provisioning capabilities. This can streamline the authentication process and help eliminate dormant accounts, reducing license costs associated with granting user licenses for applications that users never log in to.</p>
<p>Finally, tying in a robust adaptive risk engine that can evaluate the risk score of a user based on contextual information (IP address, geolocation, travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, etc.) introduces friction in the process by requiring a second <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">MFA</a> or blocking access when risk levels are higher than a set threshold.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in some recent breaches, bringing in an identity verification step with physical credentials and liveness detection during MFA/password resets – to secure a high-value transaction or out-of-compliance user –&nbsp;can build a robust, proactive identity-first security strategy.</p>

<p>Public cloud adoption has soared since the launch of the first commercial cloud two decades ago. Most of us take for granted the countless ways public cloud-related services—social media sites (Instagram), video streaming services (Netflix), web-based email applications (Gmail), and more—permeate our lives.</p>



<p>In the business sphere, both large enterprises and small startups depend on public cloud computing models to provide the flexibility, cost-effectiveness and scalability needed to fuel business growth. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51179523">International Data Corporation (IDC) report</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com), worldwide spending on public cloud provider services will reach $1.35 trillion in 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, we explore 10 top business use cases that reveal how a public cloud helps form the foundation for modern business and fuels ongoing digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a public cloud? 



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public cloud</a>&nbsp;is a type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>&nbsp;in which a third-party service provider (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud or Microsoft Azure) makes computing resources (e.g., ready-to-use software applications,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a>,&nbsp;enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms) available to users over the public internet on a pay-per-usage basis. Moreover, a public cloud model enables companies to automatically scale compute and storage resources up or down (along with data security measures and services) to meet their individual needs.&nbsp;</p>



 How does public cloud computing work?&nbsp; 



<p>In a public cloud computing model, a cloud service provider (CSP) owns and operates vast physical&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">data centers</a>&nbsp;that run client workloads. Public cloud environments are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-tenant">multi-tenant</a>, where users share a pool of virtual resources automatically provisioned for and allocated to individual tenants through a self-service&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api#:">API</a>&nbsp;interface. Multi-tenant&nbsp;hosting allows cloud service providers to maximize utilization of their data centers and infrastructure resources to offer services at much lower costs than a company-owned, on-premises data center.</p>



<p>Cloud service providers are also responsible for all hardware maintenance and for providing high-bandwidth&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking">network connectivity</a>&nbsp;to ensure rapid access and exchange of applications and data. They&nbsp;also manage the underlying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a>&nbsp;of servers, operating system software networking and other infrastructure that power a public cloud data center and maximize data center resources. For instance, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a>,&nbsp;one physical server can be split into multiple, distinct <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-server">virtual servers</a> that serve different clients.</p>



<p>All major public cloud providers continuously update and maintain their infrastructure and leverage the highest data protection and security requirements to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, they offer numerous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/identity-access-management">cloud security</a>&nbsp;tools and solutions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/identity-access-management">identity and access management (IAM)</a>,&nbsp;data loss prevention (DLP), and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem">security information and event management (SIEM)</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a service level agreement (SLA) defines the relationship between a CSP and a client and covers the performance, availability and manageability of cloud services.</p>



 Public cloud service models 



<p>Today’s cloud providers offer hundreds of managed services and tools across four main categories. These services are not mutually exclusive; most large organizations use all four to create a modern IT cloud computing environment.</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a> is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a> is a&nbsp;complete cloud platform—hardware, software and infrastructure—for developing, running and managing applications.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</a> is a cloud computing model that delivers fundamental compute, network and storage resources.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless">Serverless computing (serverless)</a>&nbsp;is a cloud computing model that offloads all the back-end infrastructure management tasks—including provisioning, scaling, scheduling and patching—to the cloud provider. 
 



 Benefits of a public cloud 



<p>The following are some of the benefits that organizations can enjoy if they employ a public cloud solution:</p>



 
 Cost-effectiveness:&nbsp;Reduce spending on hardware and on-premises infrastructures with pay-per-usage or subscription pricing models. 



 Efficiency:&nbsp;Eliminate wasted resources by paying only for what you use.&nbsp; 



 Elasticity:&nbsp;Automatically add capacity in response to unexpected surges in traffic (e.g., e-commerce flash sales).&nbsp; 



 Scalability:&nbsp;Effectively increase workloads by upgrading the capabilities of existing resources (scaling up) or incorporating additional resources to share the load (scaling out).&nbsp; 



 Innovation:&nbsp;Access cutting-edge technologies (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, edge computing, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>). 



 Spending predictability:&nbsp;Experience more predictable ongoing operating expenses to achieve lower costs for overall IT spending. 



 Team collaboration:&nbsp;Access&nbsp;public cloud resources from anywhere and allow teams to communicate with each other across distributed locations in real time for faster outcomes. 



 High availability and reliability:&nbsp;Achieve less downtime and ensure data resilience with automatic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/backup-disaster-recovery">backup and disaster recovery</a>. 



 Sustainability:&nbsp;Enhance energy efficiency through pooled CSP resources to reduce your carbon footprint. 
 



 Public cloud vs. private cloud vs. hybrid cloud vs. multicloud 



<p>Beyond the public cloud, cloud deployment models include private cloud, hybrid cloud and multicloud, each offering unique advantages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">private cloud</a>&nbsp;refers to a single-tenant cloud infrastructure operated exclusively for one company that is hosted on-premises at a company’s physical location. A dedicated cloud provider or third-party infrastructure can also host a private cloud. Private clouds are ideal settings for organizations in industries with sensitive data—like those in finance, government or healthcare—that require stringent regulatory or security requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud#:">hybrid cloud</a>&nbsp;model uses a mix of computing environments (e.g., on-premises, private cloud, public cloud) to create a single, flexible managed IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, businesses typically combine a hybrid cloud environment with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud#:">multicloud</a>—the use of public cloud services from multiple providers. A multicloud approach helps organizations avoid vendor lock-in and select the best cloud services to meet their needs.</p>



<p>A hybrid multicloud has become the de facto choice for large enterprises, giving them the most control over where workloads are deployed and scaled.&nbsp;</p>



 The top public cloud use cases 



<p>Here are 10 ways businesses leverage public cloud computing services to achieve cost savings, innovation and overall business growth.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Storage 



<p>Public&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-storage"></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-storage">cloud storage</a> consists of storage capacity and technology as-a-service, which helps organizations reduce or eliminate the capital costs of building and maintaining in-house storage capabilities. By storing the same company data on multiple machines, cloud storage offers the redundancy&nbsp;needed to support business continuity in the face of a natural disaster, an outage or other emergencies.</p>



 2. Dynamic resource allocation 



<p>A public cloud gives companies the elasticity to scale resources up or down depending on business needs. For instance, an e-commerce site with highly seasonal sales can quickly expand its online services with a public cloud. They only pay for added capacity during peak periods and then can scale back down during regular sales.</p>



 3. Development and testing 



<p>A public cloud setting offers an ideal environment for developing and testing new applications compared to the traditional waterfall method, which can be far costlier and more time-consuming. For instance, in just minutes, developers can provision testing environments on public cloud-based virtual machines (VMs). When developers finish using a testing environment, they can easily take it down.</p>



 4. Cloud-native applications and DevOps 



<p>A public cloud setting supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native#:">cloud-native</a>&nbsp;applications—software programs that consist of multiple small, interdependent services called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>, a crucial part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops#:">DevOps</a>&nbsp;practices. Developers use DevOp tools to automate cloud-native development and rapid delivery of high-quality software, building&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization#:">containerized applications</a>&nbsp;once and deploying them anywhere.</p>



 5. Low code 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/low-code">Low code</a> is a visual approach to software featuring a graphical user interface with drag-and-drop features that support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a>&nbsp;of the development process. Low-code platforms democratize app development for “citizen” developers—users with little formal coding experience. Low code helps businesses streamline workflows and accelerate the development of websites and mobile apps, the integration of external plugins, and cloud-based next-gen technologies, like&nbsp;artificial intelligence (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>.</p>



 6. Analytics 



<p>With the rise of data collected from mobile phones, the&nbsp;Internet of Things (IoT),&nbsp;and other smart devices, companies need to analyze data more quickly than ever before.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/big-data-analytics">Big data analytics</a>—the use of advanced analytic techniques against very large, diverse big data sets—has become crucial to business success. A public cloud environment provides the computing and networking infrastructure needed to support big data so companies can make faster data-driven decisions and deliver better customer experiences in real-time and at scale.</p>



 7. Hybrid multicloud strategy 



<p>A public cloud is pivotal to a hybrid multicloud strategy.&nbsp;By integrating public cloud services with private cloud or on-premises infrastructure, organizations can choose where to run workloads and select the best services from different CSPs. For instance, a financial institution may want to use the public cloud to test and develop new applications while deploying workloads sensitive to fraud and subject to regulation on a private cloud hosted by a dedicated CSP.</p>



 8. Generative AI 



<p>With its massive need for compute, storage and networking capabilities,&nbsp;<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a>&nbsp;needs the cloud to process data in real-time and at scale. Public cloud providers offer companies the capability to access data and harness processing power from multiple distributed data centers that can support generative AI workloads.</p>



 9. Edge computing 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge computing</a>&nbsp;brings enterprise applications closer to data sources (e.g., mobile phones, sensors, IoT, devices or local edge servers) for faster insights, improved response times and better bandwidth. For instance, edge devices help monitor power grid operations to reduce energy&nbsp;waste&nbsp;in the energy sector. A public cloud works synergistically with edge services by connecting them to a centralized public cloud or other edge data centers. Most often, only the most relevant data is processed at the edge. In contrast, less critical data is sent to a primary public cloud data center for processing, freeing up computing resources to ensure low latency.</p>



 10. Quantum computing 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">Quantum computing</a>&nbsp;uses&nbsp;computer hardware, algorithms and other quantum mechanics technology to solve complex problems. While quantum computing for business is still in its early stages, organizations in industries that require vast computing capabilities (e.g., chemistry, biology, healthcare, finance) are beginning to tap into quantum’s potential to transform the way they do business. Today’s public cloud service providers have started to offer services involving renting quantum machines, platforms for developing utility-scale quantum algorithms and applications and more.&nbsp;</p>



 Public cloud solutions with IBM 



<p>Harnessing all of a public cloud’s capabilities requires an enterprise-grade platform&nbsp;that can deliver a high-performance, secure and compliant cloud environment. Built to support the most mission-critical workloads, IBM Cloud is a full-stack cloud platform with over 170+ public cloud solutions to help clients mitigate third- and fourth-party risk, increase time to value, and lower cost of ownership (TCO).</p>

<p>Each year we see the challenges that enterprises face become more complex as they strive to keep up with the latest technologies, such as generative AI, and increasing customer expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For highly regulated industries, these challenges take on an entirely new level of expectation as they navigate evolving regulatory landscape and manage requirements for privacy, resiliency, cybersecurity, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-delivers-enterprise-sovereign-cloud-capabilities/">data sovereignty</a> and more. Organizations in the financial services, healthcare and other regulated sectors must place an even greater focus on managing risk—not only to meet compliance requirements, but also to maintain customer confidence and trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, it’s crucial that enterprises place an emphasis on operational resilience with the aim of maintaining stability, preserving market integrity and protecting confidential data for themselves and their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Prioritizing operational resiliency 



<p>In our view, the essence of operational resilience is an assumption that disruption is inevitable, and organizations must have measures in place to be able to absorb and adapt to any shocks. This includes cyber incidents, technology failures, natural disasters and more. With more dependency on technology and third and fourth parties, expectations are increasing for organizations to continue delivering critical business services through a major disruption in a safe and secure manner. This means actively minimizing downtime and closing gaps in the supply chain to remain competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is different from the long-standing industry practice of disaster recovery where, traditionally, companies would return to normal operations in the several days after an event with defined recovery point objectives and recovery time objectives. Although still an important practice, appetite for conventional disaster recovery approaches is diminishing across industries and especially with regulators. This is evident from emerging regulatory requirements and expectations in UK (Bank of England’s Critical Third-Party regime), Europe (Digital Operational Resilience Act), Australia (APRA CPS-230 Operational Risk Management) and Canada (OSFI – Operational Resilience and Operational Risk Management), etc. Similarly, in the U.S. the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) also indicated that the Federal Banking Agencies are considering updates to operational resilience frameworks and approaches for critical business services and for third-party services providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As hybrid cloud and generative AI adoption increases, data and applications are everywhere—across multiple clouds and vendors (SaaS/Fintech), on premises and even at the edge. For this reason, it’s more important than ever for enterprises to ensure their cybersecurity and resiliency strategy incorporates their entire IT estate, no matter where it resides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, enterprises must first prioritize the most critical business services and develop a workload and data placement strategy to determine which applications and data should reside in a certain environment based on its specific security, resiliency and data sovereignty needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the 2024 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700079592066643&amp;p5=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAivGuBhBEEiwAWiFmYcRlbSGD_xegDvXItXIwCC5M1rB7eAdb0pBXozL4X9_siImDEmLmoxoCb8EQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index</a>, attackers are increasingly shifting from ransomware to malware that is designed to steal information, which reinforces the importance of leveraging technology and approach that provides holistic view and end-to-end protection across your entire IT estate, including your partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While partnerships are essential for businesses to remain competitive and tap into new entry points, enterprises must make sure third parties are thinking about security, resiliency and controls in the same way they and their regulators are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s clear trust and security must be at the foundation of decisions about where workloads and data reside—regardless of the industry. But how can an enterprise ensure these priorities remain front and center, especially when working with third and fourth parties?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Taking an industry-specific approach to accelerating digital transformation 



<p>Hybrid cloud is now the dominant architecture adopted by enterprises, according to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/MWEMP0NJ">IBM Study</a>, but critical to hybrid cloud strategy is an <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/5-Things-to-Know-How-IBM-Cloud-for-Financial-Services-is-Helping-to-Mitigate-Risk-in-the-Industry">industry cloud</a> approach. Over the past few years, IBM Cloud® has continued to innovate on, and made significant enhancements to our enterprise cloud platform designed for regulated industries. This purpose-built approach has enabled clients to take advantage of cloud services, SaaS providers and Fintechs at a consistent level of security, resiliency and compliance to build and deliver world-class solutions for their customers, while managing third- and fourth-party risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several years ago, we took a strategic step to address the needs of our clients in regulated industries with the first industry-specific cloud platform designed to meet the needs of financial services sector. This includes the highest set of operational, resiliency, cybersecurity and regulatory standards with built-in controls informed by the industry. By meeting the stringent standards for financial services, it can be seamlessly leveraged across other industries including insurance, government, healthcare, manufacturing and telecommunications, allowing for continuous and central management of security and risk management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To support clients in their transformation journey, we are continuing our work with key industry organizations to further address risk and allow organizations to leverage the cloud with confidence. One of our premier industry forums is the IBM Financial Services Cloud Council, which now consists of a network of more than 160 CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and Risk and Compliance officers from over 90 financial institutions working together to develop safe, secure and compliant adoption of cloud and Gen AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, we are collaborating with industry leading organizations such as the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-12-15-IBM-Helps-Financial-Services-Industry-Manage-Risk-and-Regulations-with-CSA">Cloud Security Alliance</a> to advance hybrid cloud security and Gen AI adoption for enterprises. On-going engagement with regulators around the globe and private-public sector collaboration through organizations such as the U.S. Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC) and engagements with the Financial Stability Board Third-Party Risk group are also important in developing practical and consistent industry-wide approach to common challenges.</p>



 Shared understanding and ownership&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>As enterprises continue to balance the complexities of innovation, risk and resilience, we believe the path forward will be working towards a common, risk-based understanding of the core principles that underpin effective operational resiliency. It’s essential for enterprises to take ownership of their operations and prioritize their actions and investments based on the impact to themselves, their customers and market stability, but this can’t happen in a vacuum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IBM, we are committed to helping clients on this journey. We believe it takes all of us—enterprises, trade organizations, policy makers, regulatory authorities and cloud providers— to work in unison to accomplish the same critical mission: accelerating digital experiences that move the world in a secure, resilient and compliant manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries by enabling advanced analytics, automation and personalized experiences. Enterprises have reported a 30% productivity gain in application modernization after implementing Gen AI. However, the success of AI initiatives heavily depends on the underlying infrastructure’s ability to support demanding workloads efficiently. In this blog, we’ll explore seven key strategies to optimize infrastructure for AI workloads, empowering organizations to harness the full potential of AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>







 1. High-performance computing systems&nbsp; 



<p>Investing in high-performance computing systems tailored for AI accelerates model training and inference tasks. GPUs (graphics processing units) and TPUs (tensor processing units) are specifically designed to handle complex mathematical computations central to AI algorithms, offering significant speedups compared with traditional CPUs. &nbsp;</p>



 2. Scalable and elastic resources&nbsp; 



<p>Scalability is paramount for handling AI workloads that vary in complexity and demand over time. Cloud platforms and container orchestration technologies provide scalable, elastic resources that dynamically allocate compute, storage and networking resources based on workload requirements. This flexibility ensures optimal performance without over-provisioning or underutilization. &nbsp;</p>



 3. Accelerated data processing&nbsp; 



<p>Efficient data processing pipelines are critical for AI workflows, especially those involving large datasets. Leveraging distributed storage and processing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Spark or Dask accelerates data ingestion, transformation and analysis. Additionally, using in-memory databases and caching mechanisms minimizes latency and improves data access speeds.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Parallelization and distributed computing&nbsp; 



<p>Parallelizing AI algorithms across multiple compute nodes accelerates model training and inference by distributing computation tasks across a cluster of machines. Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch and Apache Spark MLlib support distributed computing paradigms, enabling efficient utilization of resources and faster time-to-insight.&nbsp;</p>



 5. Hardware acceleration&nbsp; 



<p>Hardware accelerators like FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) optimize performance and energy efficiency for specific AI tasks. These specialized processors offload computational workloads from general-purpose CPUs or GPUs, delivering significant speedups for tasks like inferencing, natural language processing and image recognition.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Optimized networking infrastructure&nbsp; 



<p>Low-latency, high-bandwidth networking infrastructure is essential for distributed AI applications that rely on data-intensive communication between nodes. Deploying high-speed interconnects, such as InfiniBand or RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), minimizes communication overhead and accelerates data transfer rates, enhancing overall system performance&nbsp;</p>



 7. Continuous monitoring and optimization&nbsp; 



<p>Implementing comprehensive monitoring and optimization practices confirm that AI workloads run efficiently and cost-effectively over time. Utilize performance monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks, resource contention and underutilized resources. Continuous optimization techniques, including auto-scaling, workload scheduling and resource allocation algorithms, adapt infrastructure dynamically to evolving workload demands, maximizing resource utilization and cost savings.&nbsp;</p>







 Conclusion&nbsp; 



<p>Optimizing infrastructure for AI workloads is a multifaceted endeavor that requires a holistic approach encompassing hardware, software and architectural considerations. By embracing high-performance computing systems, scalable resources, accelerated data processing, distributed computing paradigms, hardware acceleration, optimized networking infrastructure and continuous monitoring and optimization practices, organizations can unleash the full potential of AI technologies. Empowered by optimized infrastructure, businesses can drive innovation, unlock new insights and deliver transformative AI-driven solutions that propel them ahead in today’s competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced world, time is a precious commodity. While machines perform tasks at remarkable speeds, the human workforce often encounters periods of non-machine idle time, hindering overall productivity. Enter digital machine intelligence, a solution poised to transform the way we capture and analyze production performance to alleviate this issue and propelling the payment card issuance and personalization industry into a new era of efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>What Is Idle Time?</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the widely accepted definition is that idle time is the duration of time we wait while a machine or person, though fully functional, is not productive.</p>
<p>Idle time = scheduled production time – actual productive time.</p>
<p>The key here is the machine is fully functional (no errors, no broken parts, no system down, no communication issues, etc.), but it is not producing output for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Why Is It Important?</p>
<p>The most recent data I have gathered as a business analytics consultant in the card issuance and personalization space suggests that the average availability time for a company without any analytics solution or continuous improvement program ranges from 16% to 38%. This means that anywhere from 62%-84% of the time machines are not running when they could be. Closing that gap is where we see the largest impact when implementing continuous improvement and data-driven productivity gains on the production floor.</p>
<p>What Are Sources of Idle Time?</p>
<p>There are many common sources of idle time shared across all industries, but here we focus on those related to card issuance and personalization centers:</p>
 
 Machine or operator waiting for work or jobs – this issue stems from job planning or an issue with the preceding steps. 
 Machine or operator not authorized to perform work and waiting on approval – this could be due to quality checks, security checks, supervisor checks, missing job instructions, and so on. 
 Machine or operator is missing raw materials needed such as consumables and operator materials. 
 Machine or operator not present – this can happen for a variety of reasons including scheduled or unscheduled break, reassignment to another activity, or absenteeism with no backup resource available. 
 Machine or operator is on standby due to personal process limitations such as dual custody is required and only one operator is available, missing card needs to be found, a security incident related to the previous job run occurs and an investigation is underway, or machine calibration checks are needed. 
 The machine is undergoing setup for a variety of reasons including job loading or material loading, machine is getting cleaned or calibrated, or the workstation is getting set up for the job. 
 External dependencies are at play including a halt to production ordered by the customer, a quality or maintenance lead who initiates immediate work stoppage, a power or network outage, a supplies shortage, external software delays, an emergency evacuation, or any situation where wait times are instituted. 
 
<p>How to Reduce Idle Time</p>
<p>The first step to resolving any problem is to understand the root cause and magnitude. This is the basis of knowledge-based management or Lean Six Sigma manufacturing: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.</p>
 
 Define: The definitions have been made clear on what idle time is; now the next step is to measure them. 
 Measure: To gauge machine productivity accurately, track scheduled work time and measure actual operational periods, focusing on the cumulative bursts of output like finished personalized products. If a software-hardware solution is not available, your best bet is manual monitoring with a stopwatch for the entirety of the day, ensuring unbiased and unhindered data collection. However, one caveat is that an on-site observer may not pinpoint process and employee-related issues with the utmost precision. 
 Analyze: After obtaining data for a single machine’s scheduled work versus actual work for a day, calculate the idle time. If the idle time exceeds 15% (idle time divided by scheduled work time), there is a problem requiring attention. Achieving the industry average of 15% idle time is possible with the implementation of software-hardware tracking systems along with fostering a continuous improvement culture. Thorough data collection enables the creation of a Pareto chart, identifying the easiest-to-solve issues, or “low-hanging fruits.” Targeting these areas strategically will maximize gains. In cases of insufficient data, a return to the measure phase is necessary to confidently identify root causes. Implementing tools like Ishikawa diagrams helps isolate overlapping causes, guiding resource allocation and energy to the right focus areas. 
 Improve: Identifying the problem is just the beginning; the real challenge is solving it. Now armed with insights into the issue’s source, you can brainstorm solutions – whether it involves process modifications, personnel retraining, or technological changes. Often, this is where an external consultant can offer valuable perspectives, leveraging industry experience and unbiased insights. Once a solution is pinpointed and evaluated, an implementation plan, coupled with a trial and measurement system, ensures fair assessment and feedback from all stakeholders. This initial trial is crucial for the success of the broader rollout. Lack of an experienced continuous improvement engineer often leads to challenges and failures at this stage, making external consultation advisable. 
 Control: After the successful trial and subsequent large-scale rollout, sustaining the solution becomes the most challenging phase. The absence of proper controls, feedback mechanisms, and the ability to steer the process, teams, and operation often leads to solutions unraveling after a few months. Management’s shift in focus and personnel reverting to familiar habits contribute to this breakdown. Control is about identifying any future pains that come up and developing and adapting the solution to overcome these bumps on the road so the gains of the solution can be earned for the long run. The key to process control is to know when it is going out of control, which requires continuous monitoring and data collection every minute of every hour to identify long-term trends. This is where having software running in the background collecting data analytics is key. Without control, processes fall apart. 
 
<p>The Power of Production Analytics</p>
<p>Idle time is by far the largest contributor to operational inefficiencies in card issuance and personalization environments. Many factories are using logbook-based manual measurements to understand what is happening, which can be marred by bias, human error, and lack of detail. Without a software-hardware based analytics solution, many key opportunities to improve go undiscovered. Once these problems have been clearly identified, there is a critical process to analyze the data to identify key root causes. After that, a rigorous and creative solution-generating process must take place with a carefully orchestrated trial preceding a large rollout of the solution. Additionally, any gains from these depend entirely on the factories’ abilities to control and sustain those gains in the long run, which requires continuous data monitoring and solution steering.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are a way to package and share tamper-proof digital information so that you can always authenticate where it originally came from. What makes this technology powerful is that anyone can cryptographically verify the issuer of the credential, and that no changes to the data have occurred since the credential’s creation, enabling the information inside to be trusted and immediately acted on.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>To put it simply, verifiable credentials are packages of data created in a decentralized network by issuing organizations or parties and stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>Once created, the party issuing these packages can be verified by anyone with the appropriate software. As a credential is created, the issuing party digitally signs the information inside, and once it is signed, any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential, so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What can a verifiable credential represent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, any information tied to identification or an identity can be turned into a verifiable credential: you can represent a person, a car, a building, an organization, or a connected device, and any information that can be associated with these entities.</p>
<p>For example, colleges and universities can issue documents such as diplomas or transcripts to students&nbsp; as verifiable credentials. These can be easily shared with anyone who needs to verify that information. Verification is instant and doesn’t require going back to the university for manual proof, providing a much more efficient experience for everyone.</p>
<p>To learn more about this read our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of paper documents and manual processes</p>
<p>In today’s system, credentials are everywhere: you likely have a driver’s license, passport, maybe a badge to access your place of employment.</p>
<p>But paper documents have several drawbacks:</p>
<p>They can be stolen, copied, forged or misplaced.</p>
<p>Someone needs to be in the same physical location to acquire them</p>
<p>They need to be stored securely.</p>
<p>Using them can share more data than needed, or require you to copy down the information they contain manually.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable you to hold all the same information, digitally, in a way that you have more control over and can share how you like.</p>
<p>From an organization standpoint they provide a way to quickly share information across different systems without a need for complex direct integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Let’s walk through a quick example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the DMV can issue you a driver’s license, which contains personal information such as your date of birth, eye color, height, weight, full name, license number, and address. When attempting to purchase an age-restricted item, the vendor will often check your license to confirm your age and that you can legally purchase the item. When you hand over your ID, you hand over all of the information, not just your date of birth — and that information can easily be misused.</p>
<p>In the same scenario, a verifiable credential is still issued by the DMV, and it still contains all that personal data, but, crucially, the data can be separated and shared in a much more selective way. And we can even go a step further and simply share eligibility: the shop doesn’t need to know your actual birthdate, they just need to know if you’re over a certain age, which can be shared in the form of simple yes or no.</p>
<p>To learn more about making purchases with verifiable credentials read our article on how they will change <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">finance and payments.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does decentralization matter?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic that deserves its own blog but a quick few points are:</p>
<p>As other digital identification methods start to catch on, such as mobile driver’s licenses, it’s important to remember that simply digitizing a document does not make it secure. What is critical is how that document is stored and shared.</p>
<p>By storing verifiable credentials locally on the end user’s mobile device you can be sure they control that data and can share it only with whomever they choose to.</p>
<p>If the mobile driver’s license is not decentralized, it means that the system needs to be contacted to verify a person’s identity. This provides a slower verification process, can run into issues if the database is unreachable, and represents a huge target for bad actors.</p>

 Recently released compliance survey reveals operators’ most common concerns, why players abandon onboarding and the likely effect of UK’s upcoming financial risk checks. 



 



<p>The online gambling market shows no signs of slowing. In fact, by the end of 2024 the revenue generated from the sector is <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide">projected to exceed $107 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As new markets like Peru and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a> open, and established markets like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK </a>and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Canada </a>revise their regulatory frameworks, the challenges faced by betting and gambing operators’ compliance teams are becoming increasingly complicated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, IDnow commissioned SBC Media to investigate the compliance challenges most likely to affect operators in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ features insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry, and looked at four areas: compliance, fraud, onboarding and financial risk checks.</p>



<blockquote><p>In understanding the compliance challenges that betting and gaming operators face, we believe we can better address our clients’ pain points and empower them to provide the journey that their customers deserve.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow. </blockquote>



 Biggest compliance pain points for gambling operators. 



<p>According to the survey, the most common compliance challenge was source of funds checks, which was cited as one of the most difficult issues by more than a fifth of global respondents, rising to nearly 30% of European-based compliance professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the other end of the spectrum, respondents found age verification the least difficult to deal with, followed by identity verification, reflecting the availability of robust third-party solutions to handle that crucial part of onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another question posed in the survey was related to speed of implementation, and how long it took operators to fulfil certain compliance requirements, such as obtaining a licence, undergoing an audit and complying with regulatory requirements in a new market. While being first to market is obviously an important factor, and can be a significant competitive advantage, results from the survey suggest that becoming compliant is not something that should be rushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two-fifths of operators said they typically take 6-12 months to fulfil the compliance requirements ahead of entering a new territory, while around 30% suggested the process took 3-6 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is the most important thing to factor in when entering new markets. At around 60% each, respondents were split between the ability to utilize existing compliance software (identity verification and AML solutions) and speed of implementation as the most important factors.</p>



 Biggest fraud concerns in the gambling industry. 



<p>The second section of the survey was designed to identify the prevalence and trends of different types of fraud and the prevention of fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It revealed that bonus abuse and attempts at document fraud remain most commonplace (65% and 57% respectively), despite improvements to identification and prevention tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the future, there is also concern about social engineering attacks (54%) and the growing threat of facial recognition spoofing attacks (33%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read about the growing threat of social media fraud, which leverages social engineering, in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also broad consensus on whether AI-powered anti-fraud tools were the way forward. More than 70% of respondents either already have such tools or plan to implement them in the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The results of this survey should act as a wake-up call for gambling operators in the UK and elsewhere to prepare themselves for the emerging fraud and compliance challenges. To address these challenges, operators will need a multi-dimensional approach to identity verification and fraud prevention, that enables seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere,” said Roger.</p>

 The importance and dangers of onboarding. 



<p>Onboarding is a pivotal stage in the customer journey and can make or break your business. In a regulated industry, like financial services or gambling, the balance between offering a seamless yet safe and secure onboarding experience has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of speed and simplicity in the onboarding process was emphasised by the survey responses, with regulatory requirements seen as less of a barrier (31%) to completion than a complex and lengthy registration experience (55%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document submission proved to be the biggest challenge for global players (51%), with both ID document submission and personal financial information submission (51%) proving to be an obstacle to the completion of onboarding.</p>



 What do operators really think about financial risk checks? 



<p>No topic has been more polarizing to the UK’s gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no operator yet has experience of working within the scope of these checks, the survey posed two questions: what they expected the impact of such checks would be on the UK market and what effect they would have on the wider international industry. Most compliance professionals (66%) expressed concerns that the move would lead to lower sign-ups for licensed operators, but would, in turn, strengthen the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that some of the answers were nuanced and several respondents were open to the idea that an affordability check could have some positives for the industry such as improving trust levels among players, reducing fraud and helping to create a level playing field for smaller operators.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative, we announced </a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies</a> in November 2023. These policies are designed to help you secure your organization's resources and data based on your usage patterns, risk factors, and existing policy configuration, all while minimizing your effort. Our top recommendation for improving your identity secure posture is enabling multifactor authentication (MFA), which <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">reduces the risk of compromise by 99.2%</a>. This is why our first three policies are all related to MFA for different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we announced Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies, we’ve rolled out these policies to more than 500,000 tenants in report-only mode. In this mode, the policies don’t impact access but log the results of policy evaluation. This allows administrators to assess the impact before enforcing these policies. Thanks to proactive actions taken by administrators to enable or customize these policies, over 900,000 users are now protected with MFA. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been actively listening to your feedback. Customers shared that Microsoft-managed policies impact the number of Conditional Access policies that organizations can create. We’ve addressed this by making a significant change: Microsoft-managed policies will no longer count towards the Conditional Access policy limit. Another adjustment relates to existing Conditional Access policies. If you already have a policy in the “On” state that meets or exceeds the requirements set by the Microsoft-managed policy, the latter will not be automatically enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, we communicated that these policies would be automatically enabled 90 days after creation. However, based on customer feedback, we recognize that some customers need additional time to prepare for these policies to be enforced. As a result, we have extended the time frame before enforcing the policies for this initial set of policies. For these three policies, you will have more than 90 days to review and customize (or disable) your Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies before they are automatically enforced. Rest assured, you’ll receive an email and a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter">Message Center</a> notification providing a 28-day advance notification before the policies are enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call to Action</p>
 
 Review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>.  
 Add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>
<p> </p>
 
 Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state.<br>  
 
<p>For additional customization needs, you can duplicate these policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in February, SpruceID participated in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill, a public event held in Salt Lake City at the Utah State Capitol. This yearly event celebrates Utah’s outdoor recreation opportunities and contributions to the state’s economy, health, and quality of life. SpruceID joined the Department of Natural Resources at a booth during the event to highlight our State of Utah pilot program for digital credentials, in partnership with the Division of Technology Services and the Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>The objective of the pilot program is to demonstrate the feasibility of verifiable digital credentials for state-issued credentials across various use cases, such as off-highway vehicle education course certificates. The pilot aims to pioneer a privacy-first digital credentialing program that empowers residents to take control of their online data and seamlessly integrate with the government’s existing infrastructure while ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p><p>The booth at the Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill provided us with a platform to connect with policymakers, legislators, and the general public. We took the opportunity to demonstrate the digital credential experience for both holders and verifiers while educating attendees about the pilot program for digital credentials in Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s world, technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from paying bills and traveling to accessing healthcare and public benefits. This shift to digital services has highlighted the need for innovative government leadership in digital identity and credentialing solutions. Traditional paper or plastic credentials have increasingly shown limitations leading to privacy concerns, susceptibility to fraud, and poor user experiences.</p><p>As the pilot becomes publicly available, participants can download a digital credential for their OHV education course certificate to store on their mobile device and take it whenever they are on the trails. Whether in a highly trafficked area or remote location without cell service, the holder can access their permit and present it as a QR code for the verifier to scan in just a few taps. The verification checks the credential validity and that it has a digital signature by the Utah DNR without pinging back to the Utah servers. This means that verifications do not enable additional tracking or a new centralized database. Not only is this a more convenient and secure option for users, but it also saves significant time filling out and processing paperwork.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill was an opportunity to showcase the pilot program for digital verifiable credentials and a pivotal moment to engage with the Utah community and gather invaluable feedback. </p><p>This event demonstrated the program's potential impact on improving the efficiency, security, and privacy of state-issued credentials. We are grateful for the chance to contribute to Utah’s outdoor recreation community and look forward to the journey ahead as we work towards a more connected, secure, and digitally empowered society.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

			 The Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token unlocks easier, faster and cost-efficient access to low-risk yields from Euro Money Markets for professional investors by tokenizing the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund. Qualified professional investors can subscribe to moreliquid’s money market token in either fiat or crypto currencies. For those investing in digital assets for the first time, moreliquid offers a secure and easily accessible web3 custody solution.&nbsp; 
<p>Luxembourg – March 19th, 2024 – <a href="https://www.moreliquid.io/">moreliquid</a>, a leading digital securities investment platform, today announced its groundbreaking initiative to tokenize the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund by introducing the Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token. This move signifies a major advancement in integrating traditional financial instruments with blockchain technology, offering institutional and high-net-worth investors a unique and dynamic way to engage with the Euro money markets.</p>
<p>Regulated under the jurisdiction of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the MMMEUR token offers monthly coupon payments, providing a steady and predictable income stream for institutional and high-net-worth investors. The token’s evergreen maturity date ensures long-term engagement possibilities. Reflecting its underlying asset, the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, the MMMEUR token is designed to give qualified investors exposure to a diverse portfolio of short-term securities, carefully curated to meet stringent criteria for maturity, issuer reputation, market listing, and credit ratings as required by law. The specifics about the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund are available <a href="https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/en/institutional-investor/funds/ie0030028439">here</a>.</p>
<p>Issued on the Polygon network, the MMMEUR token sets its minimum investment at €100,000. It requires investors to be residents of the EEA, targeting primarily institutional and high-net-worth investors interested in the Euro liquidity market. This requirement ensures that the fund attracts committed and qualified investors, contributing to a stable and focused investment environment.</p>
<p>Expanding the utility of real-world asset tokens, Moreliquid allows the MMMEUR token to be managed, transferred, or utilized as collateral for loans. This integration enhances the functionality of the MMMEUR token, providing investors with increased liquidity, versatility, and security in their investments. By leveraging moreliquid’s secure and compliant DeFi platform, investors gain control and flexibility over their digital real-world assets, merging traditional finance with blockchain innovation.</p>
<p>The MMMEUR token, developed in collaboration with<a> Tokeny</a>, is available for purchase directly through cryptocurrency wallets. Utilizing the open-source ERC3643 standard for its issuance, the MMMEUR token ensures that blockchain-based securities regulations are met seamlessly, highlighting innovation, compliance, and transparency. <a href="https://copper.co/">Copper </a>and <a href="https://www.dfns.co/">Dfns</a> have been selected as the wallet management solution and infrastructure for the MMMEUR token, ensuring top-tier security and compliance. Copper’s expertise in digital asset protection assures investors of secure and regulated management of their MMMEUR tokens.</p>

This collaboration delivers a 10x improvement in both user experience and security for moreliquid and its investors. Together, we are making blockchain technology accessible and practical for mainstream finance and asset management, eliminating the initial hurdles associated with digital assets.

Now, thanks to this collaboration, moreliquid is equipped to offer a secure, compliant environment where wallets and transactions are not only controlled and monitored but also fortified cryptographically against a range of threats and mistakes.  Clarisse HagègeCEO of Dfns

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 5th to March&nbsp;18th <p>Welcome to the Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In our latest edition, we delve into sweeping crypto regulatory updates worldwide, from Europe’s fresh stablecoin standards to the UK’s latest crypto compliance proposals, from Indonesia’s tech-forward finance guidelines to Nigeria’s firm stance on crypto operations within its borders. Let’s unpack the latest moves shaping the digital asset&nbsp;world.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is undergoing significant transformations, driven by a common goal among nations to align digital asset markets with investor protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering standards.</p><p>In Europe, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is focusing on new rules for stablecoins, which are digital currencies designed to have a stable value. These rules are part of a larger set of regulations known as&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>Additionally, the UK treasury has proposed changes that could require stricter observation of crypto businesses to prevent money laundering. This means crypto companies might soon need to follow the same rules as traditional financial companies.</p><p>Over in Asia, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) is setting guidelines for using new technology in finance, including crypto, starting in 2025. This is to ensure that innovations are safe for users and the&nbsp;market.</p><p>In Africa, Nigeria’s Securities Regulator is making it mandatory for crypto businesses to set up in the country if they want to operate there. They’re also raising the fees these companies need to pay. This move aims to give the Nigerian government more control over crypto activities.</p> EU Advances Crypto Regulation with New EBA Stablecoin Draft <p>The European Union is making significant progress in clarifying crypto regulations as the European Banking Authority (EBA) unveils draft requirements for stablecoins under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.</p><p>This move, aimed at asset reference tokens (ARTs) capable of referencing a variety of currencies and assets, signifies a crucial step towards comprehensive crypto market regulation.</p><p>The potential impact on the crypto ecosystem is twofold. Positively, clearer regulations could enhance market confidence, attract more institutional investment, and foster a safer trading environment. Conversely, the stringent requirements might impose significant compliance costs, particularly affecting smaller entities, and potentially stifling innovation within the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>As the EU navigates the complex balance between innovation and regulation, the global crypto community watches closely, anticipating the ripple effects of these regulatory advancements.</p> UK Treasury Proposes Regulatory Refinement for Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK treasury’s latest consultation paper seeks to refine money laundering regulations, which will impact the crypto asset sector’s regulatory framework. The proposed changes, which build on the review of 2017’s Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs), indicate a shift towards integrating crypto assets more comprehensively within the UK’s financial regulatory system.</p><p>One of the pivotal changes includes bringing crypto asset service providers under the broader umbrella of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) supervision, eliminating the need for separate MLRs authorization. This move is set to extend the FCA’s oversight to new crypto-related activities, aligning MLRs requirements more closely with the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) standards.</p><p>The impact on the crypto ecosystem could be profound. Although, these revisions promise to streamline the regulatory process, potentially making the UK a more attractive hub for crypto businesses by clarifying compliance pathways, there is downside to it as well. After all, the increased FCA oversight could introduce more stringent control and operational challenges for crypto firms, especially smaller ones struggling with the nuances of expanded regulatory requirements.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-estonia">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Estonia</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>When it comes to cyberattacks, March has come in like a lion for Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft said in an SEC filing that that information stolen in a hack of senior leaders’ email accounts is now being used to “gain or attempt to gain access” to company source code repositories and other internal systems. The fallout remains unknown. Just a few days earlier, threat researchers at Proofpoint <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta577s-unusual-attack-chain-leads-ntlm-data-theft">reported a phishing campaign</a> by the well-known threat group TA577 that targets Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication information. Attackers sent thousands of tailored emails designed to steal employees' NTLM “hashes” (or challenge/response values) from hundreds of organizations around the globe. These “hashes” can be cracked with far-reaching consequences, depending on an organization’s security measures.</p>  
 Why Is NTLM Authentication Vulnerable  
<p>A still widely used protocol in Windows environments, NTLM provides a natively implemented and easy to use method for authenticating into applications on enterprise servers. At more than thirty years old, it’s also a perennial attack target.</p> 
<p>Weaker cryptographic algorithms, unsalted password hashes stored on the client and server / domain controller, and a lack of server authentication &nbsp;by default, leave the NTLM protocol susceptible to a variety of attacks, either in the first NTLMv1 or the newer NTLMv2 version. These include interception, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, relay and pass-the-hash attacks, as well as straightforward brute force and password cracking — eight-character NTLM password hashes can be brute-forced using <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-a-rainbow-table-attack">rainbow tables</a> and other techniques within three minutes. NTLM does not support modern authentication methods like biometrics, multi-factor authentication, or phishing-resistant FIDO keys.</p> 
 What’s Different About the TA577 NTLM Authentication Campaign?  
<p>The abuse of the NTLM protocol for gathering victim’s information and potentially stealing NTLM challenge/response material is not a new technique, and has been observed in the past in different ways. One notable example was the <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/newly-discovered-watering-hole-attack-targets-ukrainian-canadian-organizations/">compromise of the San Francisco airport website</a> and several other organizations across the world, where threat actors used the compromised sites to serve malicious code that triggered SMB connections to attacker-controlled servers.</p> 
<p>The newest campaign takes a new twist by using phishing thread-jacking techniques to deliver zipped HTML attachments customized for each individual target.</p> 
 How the Attack Works  
<p>The malicious emails appear to be replies to a legitimate message thread. Upon opening, the HTML file triggers a meta refresh attempt to connect to a text file set up by the attacker on a rogue Server Message Block (SMB) server. The attacker-controlled server can then steal the NTLM authentication values when the protocol performs its standard challenge/response exchange. Those values change according to the version of the protocol, and whether it is a NTLMv1 or NTLMv2 exchange, but consist of a nonce (a random value of a single use) that’s encrypted using the user’ passwords as the key.</p> 
<p>A very common technique used to make it easier to then crack the obtained challenge/response values, is to leverage a well known and fixed server challenge. The protocol requires the server to include a challenge, consisting of a 16-byte random number, on every connection. By making the server challenge a fixed one, it’s possible to use pre-calculated hash tables and reduce the time and processing required to crack the user’s passwords.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the steps of the attack:</p> 
 NTLM Phishing  
<p></p> 
 Consequences of a Successful NTLM Attack  
<p>Stolen NTLM challenge/response values can be used to obtain victim’s credentials and hijack accounts, access sensitive information and potentially elevate privileges. Attackers can then move laterally within the network and compromise additional systems in the case they’ve already obtained a foothold into the victim’s organization network.</p> 
 How HYPR Protects Against the TA577 NTLM Attacks  
<p>Microsoft has long provided mitigations and mechanisms to disable the use of the NTLM protocol, including migrating to more secure replacements like Kerberos. However, organizations have been slow to implement these recommendations due to the complexity and dependency of multiple products and legacy systems on these protocols.</p> 
<p>When the legacy NTLM authentication protocols cannot be disabled and are still part of the organization’s environment, the resistance to NTLM attacks comes from the strength of the user’s passwords.&nbsp;In these environments, leveraging HYPR’s passwordless approach with certificate-based authentication allows organizations to enforce smart-card usage for passwordless, and remove the dependency of users having to login with their passwords. This provides opportunities to implement mitigation strategies to some of the NTLM weaknesses, such as the use of IT or programmatically-managed strong passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR reduces the risk to organizations from attacks on NTLM authentication by TA577 and other threat actors. HYPR’s phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a> were built to protect Microsoft Entra ID environments from credential-based attacks while making login easier for users. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/press-releases/hypr-leads-passwordless-revolution-with-launch-of-microsoft-approved-enterprise-passkeys">Microsoft approved and validated</a>, Enterprise Passkeys use highly secure FIDO2 authentication protocols instead of passwords or other types of shared secrets. With HYPR in place, there is no password for an attacker to steal.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>As the NTLM authentication protocol relies on passwords, those — indeed all passwords — are a prime target for bad actors. It’s much easier to login with valid credentials than to find a new vulnerability to exploit. Moreover, attackers constantly come up with inventive ways to breach security controls. Organizations need to eliminate the source of insecurity. As a Microsoft partner and member of MISA, HYPR integrates tightly with Microsoft environments and products. Working seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID, the HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines passkey-based authentication with continuous risk monitoring and automated identity verification to provide the highest level of identity security.</p>

<p>Nobody likes paperwork. And as important as talent acquisition is for any organization, it involves a lot of it: sifting through resumes, posting job descriptions, onboarding new employees. These tasks aren’t all tedium, and in fact, they often require human-level discernment. However, many components of these tasks can now be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ai-in-recruitment/">automated or augmented by AI</a>, allowing hiring managers to focus on providing smarter, higher-level engagement with candidates. The organization that learns to leverage the latest in AI tools is able to free up employee time, so they can put a little more “humanity” into their human resources operations.</p>



<p>The typical goal of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-acquisition">talent selection process</a> is simple: target the highest qualified candidates and persuade them to apply to vacancies and sign contracts at the most favorable rates to the organization. But there are many ways where this seemingly simple process can break down. A poorly written job description, for example, can result in a deficit of applications—or an abundance of applications from candidates who might not have the right skills, resulting in wasted effort and lost time in either case. Optimizing the process with AI tools can help recruiting teams zero in on right candidates, an essential capability in increasingly competitive employment markets.</p>



<p>Below are some ways that AI is enhancing the recruitment process across its workflow, from discovering hiring needs to attracting, courting, onboarding and retaining top talent.</p>



 Predictive analytics 



<p>Before a new job listing is even written or an open position has been identified, AI algorithms can help analyze various data sources like historical hiring trends, employee turnover rates, business growth projections and workforce demographics. By processing this data, AI identifies patterns and correlations, providing insights into future hiring needs based on past trends and organizational goals. AI can help predict demand trends for specific competencies, and help hiring teams develop recruitment strategies to plan for skills gaps that might not have even presented themselves as problematic yet. AI can also analyze external data, scraping job postings and public salary information, then model various scenarios and generate reports that might help an employer make hiring decisions about, for example, whether to fill a position with an internal recruitment, fill a gap with a contractor relationship or spring for a new hire. Such tools can also help organizations develop recruitment plans for achieving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals, identifying areas where hiring policies and trends might be adjusted to align with the organization’s broader DEI strategy.</p>



 Job posting 



<p>Once a comprehensive hiring strategy is developed, AI can get to work contributing to the creation of job descriptions. Generative AI tools can quickly develop descriptions based on short prompts. Then, once these have been posted on job boards, AI can conduct A/B testing on different versions of job descriptions to evaluate their effectiveness in attracting candidates. By analyzing metrics such as click-through rates, job application conversion rates and time-to-fill, AI helps organizations identify the most successful iterations and refine their approach accordingly. Employment-based social media companies like LinkedIn use AI to help organizations A/B test ads on their platform.</p>



<p>AI contributes to the creation of more inclusive and broadly enticing job descriptions. Language biases and unintentional exclusions can deter diverse candidates from applying. AI algorithms, armed with insights derived from a vast array of data, can craft job descriptions that are not only gender-neutral and culturally sensitive but also optimized to attract a wider pool of candidates. By fostering inclusivity, organizations can tap into a more diverse talent pool, bringing in fresh perspectives and skills that contribute to a vibrant and innovative company culture.</p>



 Resume screening 



<p>Reviewing resumes is probably the first thing that many HR professionals imagine when they think of the rote work <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hr-automation">they wish they could automate</a>. And fortunately, AI-based screening technologies are getting smarter all the time, so there’s less chance of accidentally screening out a great potential hire.</p>



<p>With traditional methods, recruiters grappled with a deluge of resumes and cover letters, sometimes thousands for a single role. How could HR professionals expect to pick the needle out of the haystack in a timely fashion? AI, on the other hand, can swiftly analyze vast volumes of resumes, extracting relevant information and highlighting the best candidates whose qualifications most align with the job specifications. This ensures a more objective and consistent screening process, reducing the risk of overlooking qualified candidates. AI tools can deliver a shortlist to hiring managers, enabling them to spend less time sifting through huge piles of resumes, and more time both enhancing the candidate experience and delivering value to their organization.</p>



 Initial interviews 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/automate/rethink-recruiting">AI recruitment software</a> can also come in handy during this phase to schedule interviews by coordinating available time slots between the candidate and the recruiter. This reduces the administrative burden on recruiters and streamlines the interview process.</p>



<p>Some job openings require many rounds of interviews. Conducting interviews, especially when high-level managers are involved, can become quite expensive. The point of initial interview questions is to give the candidate and the organization basic information about one another. This “first impression” does not necessarily need to involve a human agent on the organization’s side. Chatbots can engage candidates in a conversation to gather basic information about their preferences, availability and eligibility for a role. This can serve as an additional filter on top of the resume screening phase. Meanwhile, chatbots can answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) and distribute documentation about the organization to potential candidates.</p>



<p>This exchange of information can make subsequent interviews more useful to both parties, and help save both parties time if the candidate lacks necessary skills that the resume screening, for whatever reason, didn’t catch. On the flip side, a chatbot-led interview might also indicate to the interviewee that the position is not what they thought, obviating the need for subsequent interviews.</p>



<p>Chatbots can also administer quizzes or skills assessments to evaluate a candidate’s knowledge, skills or problem-solving capabilities. Virtual assistants can use the latest <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">Natural language processing (NLP)</a> capabilities to field open-ended answers in plain language, and help determine if those answers predict whether or not an employee is likely to be a good “culture fit.” If a candidate fails to meet certain performance criteria during this phase, the organization can move on with more suitable candidates without engaging HR staff. AI can also help job seekers more seamlessly provide information for background checks.</p>



 Contract negotiation 



<p>After selecting candidates and building a job offer, the organization can rely on AI for the negotiation process. AI is increasingly good at parsing information in offer letters and contracts to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations and industry standards. By flagging potential legal issues or discrepancies, AI helps ensure that contracts adhere to legal requirements, reducing the risk of disputes or litigation. By evaluating factors such as termination clauses, non-compete agreements and intellectual property rights, AI helps negotiators assess the potential impact of contract terms and negotiate accordingly.</p>



<p>AI can analyze clauses within employment contracts and compare them to industry benchmarks or standard templates. By identifying deviations or unusual provisions, AI helps negotiators understand the implications of each clause and negotiate more effectively.</p>



<p>AI can provide recommendations to the organization for negotiation strategies based on historical data, industry norms and the specific context of the negotiation. By analyzing past negotiation outcomes and success factors, AI helps negotiators develop informed strategies to achieve their objectives.</p>



<p>AI can automate the redlining and drafting of contract amendments or revisions based on negotiators’ input. New job title? No problem. NLP technology can make quick updates that don’t need to involve manual edits. By generating proposed changes and alternatives, AI streamlines the negotiation process and accelerates the exchange of contract drafts between parties.</p>



 Onboarding and retention 



<p>The onboarding process is a fantastic arena for AI to prove itself useful, from providing new hires with relevant information, answering their queries to guiding them through the initial steps, ensuring a smoother transition for new employees. AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants can provide immediate support to new hires by answering frequently asked questions about company policies, benefits, IT setup and other onboarding-related queries. This reduces the burden on HR staff and empowers new employees to find information quickly and independently.</p>



<p>AI systems can automate the creation and processing of onboarding documentation. By streamlining administrative tasks, AI frees up HR personnel to focus on high-touch aspects of the onboarding process, while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>As an extension of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-management">overall employee experience</a>, AI can also help to ensure that employees stay satisfied throughout their tenure with the organization. AI can recommend relevant <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-development">training and development opportunities</a> for employees based on their performance, skills and career goals, contributing to ongoing professional development. By offering tailored training programs and career paths aligned with individual goals, AI helps employees feel valued and invested in their professional growth, increasing their likelihood of staying with the company.</p>



<p>Algorithms can analyze employee workloads, productivity levels and stress indicators to identify individuals at risk of burnout. By recommending workload adjustments, time management strategies or wellness initiatives, AI helps prevent burnout and promote work-life balance, leading to higher retention rates. AI algorithms can analyze employee profiles, skills and interests to match new team members with peers and mentors. By connecting new employees with experienced colleagues who can provide guidance and support, AI accelerates the integration process and promotes knowledge sharing within the organization.</p>

<p>New developments in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> are making headlines and inspiring hope in communities worldwide, from a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/09/greenland-renewable-energy/">remote Arctic village</a> working to harness solar and wind power under challenging conditions to a <a href="https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3598822/jbsa-prepares-for-first-of-its-kind-geothermal-energy-prototype/">U.S. Air Force base</a> planning an advanced, utility-scale geothermal power system.</p>



<p>As much of the world grapples with mitigating the effects of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a> and global warming, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/future-of-renewable-energy/">innovation and advancements in renewable energy</a> have emerged as a bright spot. Solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, geothermal energy and biomass energy generation is better for the planet than the burning of fossil fuels including oil, natural gas and coal.</p>



<p>But for all of the advantages of renewable energy, its development and use has disadvantages, too. Let’s take a look at both.</p>



 The multiple (and sometimes surprising) advantages of renewable energy 



<p>The advantages of renewable energy power sources are wide-ranging, and some are more obvious than others.</p>



 Inexhaustible supply 



<p>One of the main benefits of renewable energy sources like the sun, wind and water is that they will never run out. In contrast, non-renewable resources are not only finite, but cost more as their availability declines and require more extreme extraction methods with greater environmental impacts.</p>



 Carbon-free energy generation 



<p>The goal of the clean energy transition is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">decarbonization</a>. Carbon dioxide emissions reached 11.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2022 from oil alone, whereas renewable energy generation emits little to no carbon emissions to power homes, cars and businesses.</p>



 A cleaner, healthier environment 



<p>The burning of fossil fuels, like coal, releases airborne pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, while the mining of these resources can result in water pollution and damage animal habitats. Using renewable energy in place of fossil fuels can reduce these pollutants and help mitigate risks to human health and natural environments.</p>



 Energy independence 



<p>Renewable energy provides for stronger energy security by opening up new opportunities for domestic energy production, thereby reducing reliance on foreign-sourced energy supply. For example, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European countries have sought to reduce their imports of Russian oil and gas. In 2023, domestic renewable energy production in Europe rose to account for a record 44% of the EU’s electricity mix while imports from Russia declined, helping build a more stable, resilient power grid.</p>



 Less maintenance 



<p>For certain types of renewable energy sources, the maintenance and maintenance costs of their infrastructure are minimal. Solar photovoltaic systems, for example, generally don’t have moving parts and can last 25 years or more with little maintenance. Hydroelectric power plants typically <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2012/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf">have low operating costs</a> and require little maintenance as well, with long-lasting equipment that can remain in operation for decades.</p>



 Affordable energy 



<p>When it comes to costs, renewable energy sources once compared unfavorably to fossil fuels. But as fossil fuel prices rise renewable energy has emerged as an affordable alternative energy option. An <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">estimated 96% of new utility-scale solar and wind power projects</a> had lower generation costs than new coal and natural gas plants. As more renewable energy resources are integrated into power grids, businesses are also implementing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/energy-management">energy management</a> programs to optimize energy usage and reduce overall energy costs.</p>



 Job creation 



<p>While both clean energy and fossil fuel industries have seen job growth in recent years, growth has been markedly faster in the former. As a result, clean energy roles now account for <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/clean-technologies-are-driving-job-growth-in-the-energy-sector-but-skills-shortages-are-an-increasing-concern">more than half</a> of the 67 million jobs in the global energy sector. Such growth is fueling demand for additional workers and retraining for existing fossil fuel workers to transition to the renewable energy industry.</p>



 Hurdles to a clean transition: the disadvantages to renewable energy 



<p>For all the celebrated benefits of renewable energy, the sector has some downsides as well. Understanding the disadvantages of renewable energy can help organizations better plan its deployment. Here are some of the cons of renewable energy projects today:</p>



 High upfront costs 



<p>Shifting to renewable energy technologies saves money in the long run but component costs and initial costs for set-up can be expensive. For example, small businesses can expect to pay <a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/solar/commercial-solar-panel-installation-companies/">USD 100,000 or more</a> for commercial solar installations, depending on their energy needs. However, legislation for incentives, tax credits and various rebates can help offset these costs.</p>



 Location and landmass requirements 



<p>Most renewable energy power generation is location dependent—solar farms require unobstructed sunlight, hydropower requires water movement, wind farms require open spaces and traditional geothermal power requires proximity to sources of hot water. In many cases, renewable energy systems require a lot of space—more than traditional power stations. Research conducted by the ICF Climate Center found that large-scale renewable energy installations <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/24/switching-wind-solar-energy-will-require-lot-land/">require 10 times more land</a> than coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.</p>



 Production volatility 



<p>Renewable electricity generation is vulnerable to weather conditions: solar power is susceptible to cloudy days, hydropower to droughts and wind power to calm days. As such, guaranteeing the amount of energy produced at any given time is a challenge. To help companies adapt to this volatility, solutions like the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite </a>use sensors, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/geospatial-data">geospatial data</a>, advanced analytics, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and weather data to generate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/V3PG5DNY">day-ahead wind and solar forecasts</a>.</p>



 Storage requirements 



<p>Due to the intermittent nature of renewable power, batteries are required to collect energy during peak production periods for distribution in a controlled, consistent manner during periods of low- to non-production. Energy storage systems to support utility-scale applications are costly but technology is being developed to support more affordable long-term storage.</p>



 Supply chain limitations 



<p>Supply chain hurdles are hindering the installation of renewable energy projects. According to a report by McKinsey, project developers face <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/electric-power-and-natural-gas/our-insights/renewable-energy-development-in-a-net-zero-world-disrupted-supply-chains">three main challenges</a>: access to raw materials and rare earth metals amid a projected shortage; access to the talent and machinery necessary; and little supplier diversification for critical components. For example, in the case of polysilicon, a material used in solar panels, 79% of global capacity is concentrated in China, making the solar PV industry vulnerable to disruptions in that country.</p>



 Carbon footprint and waste 



<p>Although solar and wind power emit no harmful emissions during power generation, the manufacturing, installation and transportation of renewable energy equipment does often produce <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Additionally, waste products are created during asset production process and disposal, with wind turbine blades and solar panels taking up space in landfills.</p>



 Optimizing renewable energy sourcing 



<p>Businesses in the renewable energy industry or interested in sourcing renewable power can proactively monitor renewable energy trends with the right tools. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700077689489996&amp;p5=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3-Dh5rPvhAMVr0dHAR3rhgNhEAAYASAAEgIZ1fD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite</a> uses historical energy generation data, weather data and more to generate high-accuracy energy forecasts for wind and solar assets to inform key decision-making at the enterprise level.</p>

  <p>The introduction of cross-tenant access settings for Microsoft Entra External ID marked a pivotal shift in how organizations manage security and collaboration across different tenants. This blog post dives into the essence of these settings, focusing on their significance for secure B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three key areas of focus, include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The critical aspect of trusting multifactor authentication (MFA) from business collaborators, including the exploration into the balance between maintaining high security standards and ensuring a seamless user experience for B2B guest users, plus highlighting a perspective to simplify authentication processes and reduce administrative burdens.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Offering a closer look at the cross-tenant access settings and how these settings enable more granular control over cross-tenant collaborations. Real-world use cases illustrate the application of these policies in managing and restricting access to ensure security without hindering productivity and cooperation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Insights into leveraging Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access policies for improved security and collaboration and to ensure a smooth user experience.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Trust MFA from business collaborators (B2B collaboration) by default&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected digital landscape, organizations are increasingly embracing B2B collaboration to streamline workflows and facilitate cooperation with external partners. As part of this collaborative approach, many businesses routinely create guest user accounts within their Microsoft Entra tenants and grant trusted partners access to their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, many have already extended the requirement for MFA to B2B guest users. This, however, requires external users in cross-tenant access scenarios to register an additional authentication method in the foreign tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for B2B guest users to register for an additional MFA method in the resource tenant basically increases the account security, but at the same time it adds layers of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 User experience disruption in a B2B collaboration scenario&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B2B guest users who have already implemented MFA in their home tenant and have become accustomed to the convenience of advanced MFA methods like Windows Hello for Business, encounter disruptions when attempting to access the resource tenant. Even if users have already provided strong authentication in their home tenant, they will still be prompted for authentication again in the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: MFA prompt for B2B guest user who access protected resource in foreign tenant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Administrative overhead for IT and users&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team face additional administrative tasks. For the guest user, navigating a new MFA setup and maintaining an additional MFA registration can be annoying. For the tenant administrator and the support team, managing these additional MFA registrations can increase overhead significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where a guest user loses access to their device or does not have a backup for a new device, regaining access to their account involves additional administrative tasks for both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team. The guest user may need to perform a new MFA setup, while the tenant support team need to manage the additional MFA registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wondering why guest users must register an additional authentication method per resource tenant when they already have one in their home tenant? Well, let's talk about the trust settings in cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the authentication process&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more efficient approach to managing MFA in cross-tenant B2B collaborations is to trust the MFA from a guest's home tenant. Doing so eliminates the need for additional MFA registration and maintenance in the resource tenant. This means that the user can continue to use his usual strong authentication method that he uses in his home tenant and does not have to register another method in the resource tenant. This is a considerable relief for the user and the support team of the resource tenant no longer has to deal with the MFA registrations of the guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA default trust settings are configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center (<a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com</a>). In the default configuration, a Microsoft Entra ID tenant does not trust any incoming MFA from other tenants. To change the behavior, the inbound defaults must be edited. The following screenshots provide a walkthrough and show the desired configuration. The "Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants" setting is disabled by default and must be enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra admin center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings - Default Trust settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple configuration enables B2B guest users to use their existing MFA in their home tenant to satisfy existing MFA requirements in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once configured, B2B guest users can use additional authentication methods that have a higher authentication strength than MFA methods that are only available in a foreign resource tenant. This is a very important advantage because this configuration also enables the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods for B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Comparison of the authentication methods available in the home tenant and a resource tenant</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about available authentication methods, refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strength-external-users">Microsoft Entra documentation about authentication strengths for external users.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this configuration is designed to enhance the user experience and ease the administrative efforts, it can inadvertently create security risks. For instance, guest users might opt for simpler, less secure authentication methods in their home tenant compared to the authentication methods typically used in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid these risks, the cross-tenant access trust settings work seamlessly with Conditional Access and authentication strengths. Plus, with MFA trust, guest users can use the same phishing-resistant authentication methods used in their home tenant like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 keys, and certificate-based authentication to get access to the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key advantage can be used to increase the login security of guest users. When the default trust settings are adjusted, the Conditional Access policies and authentication strengths should be reviewed at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We explored the benefits of using MFA trust to leverage the same strong authentication methods used by guest users in their home tenant to improve security, usability and efficiency. In the next chapter, we will look at how tenant administrators can control outbound collaboration settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Outbound access restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings, organizations can manage their collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations. These settings provide more granular control over access, allowing you to manage how you collaborate with external organizations. In this section, we will take a closer look at the outbound settings feature and its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions vs. inbound and outbound settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions and cross-tenant access settings are two powerful tools that can help you control access to your organization’s resources. While they are often configured together, it’s important to understand that they operate separately from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-v2#tenant-restrictions-vs-inbound-and-outbound-settings">Microsoft Learn</a> article:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although tenant restrictions are configured along with your cross-tenant access settings, they operate separately from inbound and outbound access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant access settings give you control when users sign in with an account from your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, tenant restrictions give you control when users are using an external account.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of cross-tenant access settings this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inbound settings control external account access to your internal apps.&nbsp; 
 Outbound settings control internal account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 Tenant restrictions control external account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, tenant restrictions allow you to create a policy to control access to external apps when users sign in with an external account from your networks or devices while the inbound and outbound access settings focus on guests accounts in your tenant or guest accounts in resource tenants (what your users is accessing and where).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this all cleared up let’s focus on using an outbound access setting and a real-world application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-world use case&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a real-world use case to leverage the outbound settings control. The Contoso organization is used in the following use case:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso would like to implement more detailed controls with B2B business collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Contoso would like to only collaborate with specific organizations. This includes the ability to securely add or remove partner organizations as the need arises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Additionally, Contoso would need the ability to restrict applications that can be accessed in any partner resource tenant along with the ability to restrict and control user access to partner resource tenants.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up the outbound restriction for the needed use case, we will need to configure the outbound defaults. This essentially will block all outbound collaboration. Note that this can be scoped to either include all users, selected users or all or selected external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From within the Microsoft Entra Admin center, navigate to the External Identities menu and select the cross-tenant access setting feature. From here select the default settings config followed by edit outbound defaults.&nbsp; Select Block access followed by the applies to option. We can either select a subset of users or apply this to all users. In this example all users are blocked and all external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Outbound defaults</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Figure 6: Outbound block access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting any access in a resource tenant will result in the below notification. This is expected since the tenant wide outbound access default setting is in place explicitly blocking any resource tenant level access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Resource tenant blocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking at the user sign-in logs, we can establish the same conclusion via the failure reasoned and the resource tenant accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Sign-in logs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable collaboration when the outbound access default setting is applied, a tenant ID or domain name of a resource tenant or origin must be included in the cross-tenant access settings of Microsoft Entra. In the example below, the tenant of Contoso’s partner organization “Wingtip Toys” is added and the outbound access configuration setup to allow collaboration with selected Contoso users. In this case, the users with group membership to “External-TR-ContosoAccess” will be allowed access to selected application as per figure 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a Privileged Access Group (PAG) can be used allowing no permeant standing access. Access must be requested via Privileged Identity Management (PIM). The PIM activation process can be set up to require an approver, MFA or additional authentication context via Conditional Access. E.g. step-up authentication or location-based policy restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9: Outbound access settings users and groups</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10: Outbound access settings external applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon configuring the needed outbound access settings any user that is part of the selected user or group outbound configuration setting will be allowed access to the selected external applications. In the below example we can see the demo user accessed a selected external application as per previous configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 11: sign-in log successful</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>With cross-tenant access and outbound access settings, customers can granularly restrict and control collaboration with external resource tenants. This enables more control over what your internal accounts can access externally and where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution: Before enabling, it’s important to understand this is a tenant wide configuration and you will need to understand and evaluate your organizations collaboration needs and scope the outbound access setting and allowed organizations accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explored how to use cross-tenant access and outbound access settings in Microsoft Entra to manage and secure external collaboration. Cross-tenant access allows you to share your resources with users from other tenants, while outbound access settings and tenant restrictions let you control which external tenants your users can access. You can configure both features at the tenant level and specify the allowed or blocked organizations according to your business needs. Additionally, we have discussed how to use Default MFA Trust to use existing, strong authentication methods from foreign tenants in cross-tenant access scenarios and improve your security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next blog, we will look more closely at tenant restrictions and authentication strengths and contexts. Keep following this blog series, post your feedback, and we hope you join us again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMmZNwOsIs">YouTube explainer video</a> on how tracking and authentication use the same mechanisms to meet their goals, and how browsers can’t tell the difference. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Welcome to The Digital Cow Network! My name is Heather Flanagan, principal at Spherical Cow Consulting. Let’s talk about how individuals are tracked as they surf the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve all know we are tracked as we surf the web. Sometimes, it’s to show us target advertisements to get us to spend more money. More nefariously, it influences our political leanings or generally sows societal chaos. Why isn’t there more control to prevent this from happening? Shouldn’t there be something that protects all web users, from the least tech-savvy to the most informed individuals? Yes, but it’s not that simple. The underlying mechanisms that trackers use are the same tools used to support third-party logging into a website, also known as federated authentication.</p>



<p>And you know what? Browsers can’t tell the difference when mechanisms used for tracking or when they are used for logging in. They are technically indistinguishable. This makes changing or removing those features more complicated than you’d think.</p>



 The Dilemma of Browser Tracking  



<p>What are these mysterious mechanisms, and why are they used when people log in to a website if they are also part of an invasion of privacy? Time for a quick history lesson!</p>



<p>The Internet came out of a research project. Everyone knew everyone else, or at least they knew the people online had to be a part of a very small community in order to use this new thing. The web came much later, but it still had that research and exploratory mindset, that nearly green field drive that suggested building little widgets that people could turn into anything they could imagine was the path towards innovation. The Internet, and therefore the web, was built on something that didn’t have robust, automatable trust mechanisms built in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of these innovations was the concept of a piece of data that would allow developers to keep information local to a browser so each web page didn’t have to ask for the same information over and over again, something called saving state. It also encouraged the use of IP addresses, once upon a time the unique address for each computer on the network, as a way to indicate whether an individual (the only one probably using that computer) to access something remotely. It encouraged a lot of things and people through of all sorts of ways to use these building blocks of the web to do new things, from supporting third-party accounts when logging in to targeting advertisements to individuals.</p>



<p>That’s enough history. Let’s dive into the mechanics. From third-party cookies to IP addresses and browser fingerprinting, these tools are essential for a smooth online experience but can also be used for tracking. Understanding these mechanisms is key to navigating the digital landscape.</p>



 Segment 3: Third-Party Cookies and Privacy  



<p>HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of information created by a website and placed on an individual’s computer or other device by their web browser. The idea behind doing this was to make it so people didn’t have to share information every time they went to a new page. Imagine if you had to log in Every. Single. Time. you went to a new web page owned by the same company. It’s crazy talk! Being able to “maintain state” from one page to the next is great for the user experience (UX).</p>



<p>Here’s where it gets murky. There is more than one kind of cookie, and for the sake of this explainer, we’re going to talk about first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are a way for a single domain to maintain state across all the web pages in its domain. It’s definitely a desirable thing for a clean UX. These cookies are ONLY accessible by the domain that created them. No other domain can read what’s in that cookie.</p>



<p>Then there are third-party cookies. These cookies are accessible to any website at any domain. And sometimes that’s fine. Let’s look at CNN. The company CNN owns cnn.com, headlinenews.com, cnnradionet.com, money.com, and probably several others. The parent company wants visitors to have a consistent experience, which means leaving bits of data for their various domains to read. They want all their services to look and act like you (probably) want them to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third-party cookies are also used so that when you tell a website you want to log out, it knows what to log you out of. That’s a big security feature right there and something that needs to be adapted when browsers no longer support third-party cookies. Though, to be honest, implementing this properly is really hard and many sites have already given up on the idea of a secure, global logout.</p>



 Segment 4: The Complexities of Browser Fingerprints and IP Addresses  



 IP Addresses 



<p>Most people don’t have to think about a computer’s numeric address. That said, computers communicate via numbers, and both your devices (your phone, tablet, and desktop) and the computers hosting the websites you’re visiting all have these addresses. They are called IP addresses and are a fundamental necessity to ensuring Internet traffic knows where to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once upon a time, these addresses were tightly tied to specific computers that didn’t move around. There were also enough of these addresses for all the computers on the Internet. And with that in mind, it made sense to say, “I know who is at this IP address. That address can access my computer.” While the basic assumptions about IP addresses are no longer always accurate, there’s still something to them. Some websites still create access policies based on what IP addresses are allowed. It’s a very smooth UX; the individual doesn’t have to do a thing. It just works.</p>



<p>When you go to a website, one of the things that happens is that the visit is recorded in a log. Logs are necessary to troubleshoot problems. They are also a way to understand who and what is visiting a website. And if that data is shared behind the scenes, a single IP address can be followed like you can follow footprints in the snow.</p>



 Browser Fingerprints 



<p>When you install a web browser, you probably add plug-ins, add-ons, your favorite fonts, your preferred settings, and so on. Here’s a fun fact: if you have done those things, you might have an impressively unique “fingerprint” that distinguishes your browser from all others.</p>



<p>There are a few websites that will let you check this out. For example, <a href="https://amiunique.org/">https://amiunique.org/</a> and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/</a> will let you see just how unique your browser setup is when compared to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you visit a website, it often asks your browser about all its settings to offer you the best UX. It might have a slightly different way of presenting information if you’re using Chrome or Firefox. It might pop up a sadness window if you’ve blocked ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Browser fingerprinting isn’t usually used to let you log into a website. However, some enterprise software may be looking for a specific plug-in or configuration as part of its requirements to allow you access.</p>



 Link Decoration and Bounces  



 Link Decoration 



<p>But wait, there’s more! One of the more subtle and ubiquitous features of trackers and authentication services is link decoration. Also referred to as “navigation-based tracking,” this feature adds extra information to the URL. That information can be part of an authentication token. It can be part of a query so the website knows what to display after you’ve done a product search. When you click on the link in an email, it will add the method you used to the address so the website owners know what advertising works for them.</p>



<p>Browser vendors are cautious when changing what they’ll support in links. Of course, they also have to worry about being able to identify when links are being used for tracking or something else. So many features that the web experience is built on requires link decoration. And so many trackers love it. It’s complicated.</p>



 Bounces or Redirects 



<p>The last one we’ll review in this post is bounces, also known as redirects. Bounces and redirects are as fundamental to the web experience as link decoration. These are used extensively to support critical login features for protocols like OAuth and SAML, used by websites everywhere. Authentication is complicated, and there is almost always more than one computer behind the scenes making it happen. These computers, possibly from different domains, need to talk to each other to get you logged in. They bounce data back and forth before returning a “go” or “no go” to your login experience.</p>



<p>Bounces are also, unfortunately, used by trackers to get around the third-party limitations on cookies described in the section above.</p>



<p>Remember that browsers are trying to prevent websites from reading cookies they didn’t write. Cookies are for the first party; third parties need to find another website to bother. But what if there is an advertising agreement between these two parties? They really want to share that data! The easiest thing to do is to make that third party become a first party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an individual visits a website directly, that makes it a first-party experience. You visit Website A; Website A is now a first party. But what if Website A has an agreement with an advertiser at Website B and adds a single pixel to their web page? Then the individual loads that pixel, thus “visiting” Website B. Website B can now set or edit a first-party cookie. They can do that every time you visit a website they have an agreement with, thus building up a record of what sites you’ve visited, where you’ve made purchases, etc.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Browser vendors can’t just wave a magic keyboard and fix all tracking challenges. Turning off all the mechanisms that allow tracking will also break some of the most critical security features of the web. Work within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is underway to find a way through this mess. Browser vendors have also been making their changes. Apple turned off third-party cookies years ago. Mozilla turned them off by default for all Firefox users in 2023. Google Chrome is still working on it, but they are much bigger than all other browser vendors combined and have much more business riding on these features.</p>



<p>In our next post, I’ll focus on the work around the deprecation of third-party cookies.&nbsp;</p>

Part 3: How do you use KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  <p>This part explains only essential components that constitute the KERI protocol while not going into deep technical details.</p> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet  Fragmentation in the decentralized identity ecosystem <p>As outlined in a recent “<a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Wallet Strategy</a>” series by <a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Dan Robertson</a>, one of the biggest problems in the decentralized identity space is its presently fragmented ecosystems. This is an extremely complex issue that involves many business and technical aspects—including credential formats, credential exchange protocols, and many more. This blog limits the scope of the discussion to identifiers and key management, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>As of March 2024, there are a total of 189 DID methods registered in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>. This number has been increasing steadily since the registry was created in 2020, and there are likely a hundred more DID methods out there in the wild, which have not yet been registered.</p><p>Although a large proportion of these methods are experimental, some of which have no longer been maintained, this number has raised significant concern among many members of the digital identity ecosystems. In the past few years, this topic has also been the subject of heated debates. While some argue that the abundance of DID methods is a sign of a thriving ecosystem, many contend that the sheer diversity has spawned considerable interoperability challenges.</p><p>While this blog shall not take part in the debate, one cannot help but wonder “Could there possibly be a unifying DID method that covers the use cases of all others?” This is precisely what KERI attempts to&nbsp;be.</p> An elephant in the&nbsp;room <p>However, we have to address a big elephant in the room before we continue.</p>Ref: Xkcd comic, “<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">How Standard Proliferate</a>”.<p>KERI is indeed a DID method that was designed to be the “one universal standard that covers everyone’s use case”. However, adding one more DID method to the ever-growing list does not necessarily mitigate the situation, and it remains uncertain if KERI will ever achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>Putting all that aside, KERI provides unique properties and benefits not found in other DID methods, as elaborated in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a> of this series. What makes KERI special is also the fact that it is not just another DID method. The KERI protocol has a grander vision of being the identity overlay for the internet.</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be a secure identity overlay for the internet.</blockquote> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The internet is arguably one of the most important inventions in human history, enabling instant connections between everyone across the globe. The success of the Internet is attributed to its hourglass model where the Internet Protocol (IP) is the one common protocol for all supporting protocols below it and all applying protocols above it, i.e., the IP protocol being the spanning layer of the Internet.</p>Ref: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the Trust over IP Stack</a>, Version 1.0, 17 November&nbsp;2021<p>Unfortunately, as the late Kim Cameron once wrote in <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">The Laws of Identity</a> in 2005, “The Internet was built without an identity layer.” Given the immense complexity and widespread usage of the Internet, attempting to reconstruct its infrastructure to integrate such a layer is simply unfeasible. Hence, the development of an identity solution must be overlaid on the existing Internet framework. To achieve global interoperability, such an identity overlay must also embody an hourglass shape, serving as a trust-spanning protocol that seamlessly links all Web2 and Web3 applications.</p>Ref: The <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a><p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF)</a> under the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> Foundation is currently developing the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> where KERI is used as one of its candidate protocols for Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs).</p> Foundational Components of&nbsp;KERI <p>The previous section explains what KERI is at the conceptual level where it is designed to be the identity overlay for the internet and is also a variant of DPKI. To get deeper into the technical details,</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized management protocol for persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), using novel key pre-rotation mechanisms. KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>There are four foundational components for the KERI protocol as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Autonomic Identifier (AID)  Pre-rotation  Key Event  Key Event&nbsp;Receipt   1. Autonomic Identifier (AID) <p>The KERI protocol is dedicated to the long-term management of a special class of identifiers that are both self-certifying and persistent. These identifiers are called autonomic identifiers (AIDs) in the KERI protocol.</p><blockquote>Note: The word “autonomic” is an adjective that means self-ruling, self-governing, or self-regulating.</blockquote> Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) <p>A Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived from one or more key pairs. It is self-certifying—i.e., self-authenticating—since the controller of the SCID who holds the private could cryptographically verify their control by digitally signing a message, e.g., via a challenge-response protocol. The mapping between an identifier and its controlling key(s) is self-contained in the identifier itself. Hence, a SCID is considered a decentralized identifier as it does not rely on any trusted third party to generate or&nbsp;manage.</p><blockquote>Note: An entity that holds an authoritative set of private keys is called a controller of an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Basic SCID <p>A basic SCID is a variant of SCIDs that is cryptographically generated and bound to a single key pair. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable since it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure. Hence, a basic is not persistent and is not suitable for long-term use.</p><p>The figure below demonstrates a process for creating a SCID, the controller captures sufficient entropy—e.g., using random noise from electronic equipment— to generate a key pair. A common basic SCID could be generated by using a hash digest of the public&nbsp;key.</p> AIDs are Persistent SCIDs <p>An AID is a variant of a SCID is that persistent as it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the same AID. The mechanism for evolving the AID’s key state is called pre-rotation.</p>Difference between a basic SCID and an&nbsp;AID An AID is a primary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI <p>A root of trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely. An AID is also a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol, which is purely cryptographic and decentralized, not relying on any centralized entity or even any blockchain network.</p><blockquote>An AID is used as a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol that is purely cryptographic. As a consequence, the security of KERI-based identity systems only relies on cryptography, requiring no trust in external entities or even any blockchain network.</blockquote> 2. Pre-rotation <p>In the KERI protocol, the mechanism used to evolve a key state of an AID is known as pre-rotation. Except for a few special cases, an AID is cryptographically bound to at least two sets of key pairs, each of which holds different control authorities over the&nbsp;AID:</p>  The first set is called the current key(s), which holds the signing authority. The current key(s) of an AID can be used to, for instance, sign arbitrary messages such as verifiable credentials, authenticate the AID’s controller, and anchor external data to KERI’s ledgers, called key event&nbsp;logs.  The second set is called the next key(s), which holds the rotation authority. The next key(s) of an AID can be used to change the key state of the AID, including changing the current keys, that is, transferring the signing authority to another set of&nbsp;key(s).  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote> Pre-commitment <p>When an AID is created (i.e., incepted), the controller of the AID makes a pre-commitment to the next key(s) that hold rotation authority over the AID. The next key(s) are hidden using a cryptographic hash function, and they are only revealed at the moment the key state of the AID is&nbsp;rotated.</p><p>The next key pair — both private and public keys — must be kept secure and hidden until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority.</p><p>This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is pre-committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote> Recovery from Quantum&nbsp;Attack <p>As pre-rotated next key(s) are hidden by a cryptographic hash function, the next key(s) are thus resistant to quantum attack. This is because hash functions are not vulnerable to the Quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current key of an AID could still be broken by a quantum attack, allowing a threat actor with access to a quantum computer to gain the signing authority over the AID. However, the legitimate controller of the AID could still regain control over the AID by using the next key(s) to rotate the AID’s key state, perhaps using a quantum-safe algorithm for the new set of current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Hence, the use of pre-rotation in the KERI protocol makes it quantum-recoverable.</p> 3. Key&nbsp;Event <p>The key state of an AID is determined by a data structure called a key event that consists of the current key(s) and pre-rotated next key(s) as well as other configurations for the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The key state of an AID is defined as a set of currently authoritative key pairs for the AID and any other information necessary to secure or establish control authority over an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Key Inception Event <p>The AID is itself cryptographically derived from its very first key event, called an inception event, thus giving the AID its self-certifying property. The inception event must also be cryptographically signed by the current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The example below demonstrates a scenario where an AID has single key pairs for its current and next keys. An AID is derived and bound to the key inception event, which includes:</p>  the first public key, which is used as the current&nbsp;key,  the digest of the second public key, which is used as the pre-rotated next&nbsp;key.  <p>The first public key could be revealed to other entities while the pre-rotated second public key must be kept&nbsp;hidden.</p>An AID is derived from an inception event that consists of two sets of keys, namely the current key and (pre-rotated) next key. The current key is used to sign the key inception event. The AID is pre-committed to future rotation by the second&nbsp;key. Key Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>The pre-rotated next key(s) of an AID may be used to create a subsequent key event, called a rotation event, that changes the AID’s key state. The rotation event must be signed by the next key(s), revealing the next key(s). Hence, the next key(s) can be used for rotation only once, after which the next keys must be either discarded or repurposed as members of the new set of subsequent current key(s). The controller of the AID must also assign a new set of pre-rotated next key(s) in the rotation&nbsp;event.</p><p>Following the example above, the AID could be rotated to revoke the signing authority of the first key pair by using the private key of the pre-rotated second public key to sign a rotation event. In the rotation&nbsp;event,</p>  the second public key is now repurposed to be the new current&nbsp;key,  a new key pair, the third public key, is pre-committing to the future rotation of the&nbsp;AID.  The key state of the AID is evolved by revealing the second (pre-rotated) key and using it to sign a key rotation event. The rotation event includes a new next key that pre-commits the AID to future rotation. Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL) <p>As the key state of an AID evolves, the key events are cryptographically linked in a hash chain that provides a key history for the AID. Such a data structure is called a Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>Formally, a KEL is a hash-chain verifiable data structure used to verify the key state of an AID as it evolves through its lifecycle. A KEL could be compared to a transaction ledger in a traditional blockchain, where key events are transactions in the KERI protocol.</p><p>Following the example above, the KEL of the example AID starts with the inception event with the first public key and the hash digest of the second key. The inception event is chained to subsequent rotation events via the pre-rotation mechanism.</p>A key event log of the AID that contains a hash chain of its key&nbsp;events.<p>Hence, the control authorities — both signing and rotation — of the AID at any point in the KEL can be validated in a self-contained manner by verifying the signatures and recalculating the hashes that connect the key events in the KEL, all the way back to the inception event.</p><blockquote>Note: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote> 4. Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>At its core, the KERI protocol establishes an infrastructure facilitating the exchange of key events as well as key event receipts. This highlights the protocol’s designation as the “Key Event Receipt Infrastructure.”</p><p>The exchange of key events and key event receipts could carried either directly between controllers of AIDs or indirectly through supporting infrastructures.</p> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>In the KERI protocol, communications and transactions revolve around the exchange of key events among controllers of AIDs. When a controller receives a key event, they can sign it using the key associated with their AID. This signed key event is called a key event receipt, which provides a non-repudiable proof that the recipient has received—i.e., witnessed—the key&nbsp;event.</p> Key Event Receipt Log&nbsp;(KERL) <p>Key event receipts of an AID could be recorded in a verifiable data structure called a key event receipt log (KERL). A KERL contains the signed key event history of an AID. A verifier of an AID may verify the AID’s key state by using a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Direct mode <p>Key events and key event receipts can be exchanged directly between two controllers. This is known as the direct mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>In the direct mode, a controller of an AID may send its KEL to another controller, called a validator of the AID. Upon reception of a key event, the validator signs the received key events to generate a key event receipt and subsequently returns it to the controller as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for their AID and the validator for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL of their own AID as well as a KERL of the other’s AID. This allows each party to be trusted with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p> Indirect mode <p>Since a controller of an AID may not always be online. The controller may designate witnesses that store and forward key events to any requestor. This is known as the indirect mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for discovering the KEL of an AID. The witnesses also sign the key events to create witnessed key event receipts.</p><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p> Additional Infrastructures <p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller of the AID, they may not be entirely trusted by validators of the AID. For example, the AID and its witnesses could be compromised or behave maliciously such that the witnesses provide inconsistent key event histories, called duplicity.</p><p>Consequently, a validator of the AID could designate additional infrastructure to detect duplicity of the AID’s key event history. These additional infrastructures include watchers, jurors, and judges. The infrastructures may be designated a validator or a group of validators to “watch” the witnesses to detect any duplicity in the AID’s key event history as well as make decisions on the validity of the AID’s&nbsp;KEL.</p> Blockchain as KERI witnesses and&nbsp;watchers <p>As discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a>, while the KERI protocol does not necessarily rely on a blockchain, KERI may leverage blockchain for the discovery and verification of KELs. In other words, blockchains could be utilized in a KERI-based identity system practically taking the roles of KERI witnesses and watchers. Hence, you could have the best of both worlds, obtaining the advantages that traditional blockchains offer. Since the root of trust in the KERI protocol is within the AIDs themselves, the AIDs could be migrated from one blockchain network to another, avoiding the ledger-locked problem that plagues most blockchain-based DID&nbsp;methods.</p> KERI in a&nbsp;Nutshell <p>Conceptually, the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be an identity overlay for the Internet. Each word in KERI has the following meanings:</p>  Key refers to asymmetric key cryptography that is used to control persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs).  Event refers to a series of Key Events in a hash-chain verifiable data structure called Key Event Logs (KELs) that record the key-state evolution of AIDs via the Pre-Rotation mechanism.  Receipt refers to signed receipts of key events, called Key Event Receipts that provide non-repudiable proof while exchanging key events between&nbsp;AIDs.  Infrastructure refers to the protocol for exchanging non-repudiable key event receipts, including the designation of Witnesses, Watchers, Jurors, and&nbsp;Judges.  <p>The next part of the series discusses “How do you use KERI?” which includes references to other introductory materials and a collection of open-source implementations, standards, and whitepapers.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-2-what-exactly-is-keri-e46a649ac54c">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

<p>With the acceleration of digital transformation and hybrid work, the number of devices and machines accessing critical data and resources has increased exponentially. The growing number of devices accessing sensitive data gives rise to an expanded attack surface that leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause financial and reputational damage.</p>
<p>The traditional network perimeter is no more. Identities – whether human or machine – have become the new line of defense when it comes to protecting against cyberattacks. To effectively manage your devices, you need complete visibility over all devices and machines in your organization. While digital certificates are an effective way to create and manage machine identities and device authentication to secure data and communication between a device and an organization’s critical resources (whether in the cloud or on-premises), managing the lifecycle of these digital certificates across disparate environments and a multitude of different devices is proving to be a challenge for many enterprise IT teams.</p>
<p>Managing Digital Certificates Across Devices and Operating Systems</p>
<p>Having a complete certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solution that enables automation is key to having control and ensuring compliance across your digital certificate estate. In addition, an effective PKI solution should support multiple protocols to support certificate enrollment across a number of devices (mobile, laptops, IoT, etc.) and operating systems to provide end-to-end CLM across a global enterprise.</p>
<p>Much like the remote/hybrid work option allows people to be flexible, a PKI solution must integrate with mobile device management (MDM) solutions to allow organizations to do the same, in turn supporting advanced identification, authentication, and authorization schemes, enabling organizations to deploy and manage MDM solutions effectively with strong machine identities. Microsoft Windows devices that account for a large number of workforce devices use the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions Protocol (WSTEP), which allows for secure certificate enrollment and revocation capabilities.</p>
<p>Automation is a key requirement for CLM to ensure seamless certificate enrollment and revocation processes. Having a cloud-based PKI as a service that integrates with MDM solutions eliminates the costly overhead with on-premises infrastructure and ensures your organization is being actively managed and secured.</p>
<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, it’s up to you and your organization to continue to grow and evolve with the trends and reduce complexity for enterprise IT departments worldwide. Learn how <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/pki/managed-services/pki-as-a-service">Entrust PKI as a Service (PKIaaS)</a> enables seamless <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/mobile-device-management-byod">integration with leading MDM vendors</a> like Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace ONE, Google Enterprise MDM via Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), Ivanti, and Jamf Pro, so customers can deploy and provision digital certificates with ease.</p>

<p>A large US-based healthcare company recently engaged with IBM® to accelerate their cloud adoption with consistent and predictable outcomes. This collaboration enhanced their confidence to navigate app modernization across various applications and landing zones for both hybrid cloud and platform-native modernization.</p>



<p>As a healthcare company, this client had an obligation to provide safe, reliable, time-sensitive, high-quality services to its customers. Ultimately, they needed best-in-class application modernization tooling to help &nbsp;deliver on that obligation.</p>



<p>When a client is not able to properly visualize all applications and their underlying dependencies properly, they risk experiencing diminished reliability. Managing large internal and vendor teams to maintain multiple applications can be extremely difficult. To accelerate the hybrid cloud journey and control costs, it is critical to prioritize specific execution and transformation steps.&nbsp;</p>



 How IBM helped improve the app modernization strategy 



<p>IBM Consulting® worked with the client’s cloud team and technical experts to deploy <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/cloud-accelerator">IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerator</a>, which helped them understand the business logic surrounding their many applications.

  <p>Today <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurityGA">we announced</a> that Microsoft Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide on April 1. The following new Microsoft Entra skills will be available in the standalone Copilot for Security experience: User Details, Group Details, Sign-in Logs, Audit Logs, and Diagnostic Logs. User Risk Investigation, a skill embedded in Microsoft Entra, will also be available in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills help identity admins protect against identity compromise through providing identity context and insights for security incidents and helping to resolve identity-related risks and sign-in issues. We’re excited to bring new identity capabilities to Copilot for Security and help identity and security operators <a href="http://aka.ms/copilotforsecurity">protect at machine speed.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity skills in Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what each of these new Entra Skills in Copilot for Security do to help identity professionals secure access, while easily integrating into any admin's daily workflow via natural language prompts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User details can quickly surface context on any user managed in Entra, such as username, location, job title, contact information, authentication methods, the account creation date, and account status. Admins can prompt Copilot with phrases like "tell me more about this user”, “list the active users created in the last 5 days”, “what authentication methods does this user have”, and “is this user’s account enabled” to pull up this kind of information in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group details can summarize details on any group managed in Entra.&nbsp; Admins can ask Copilot questions like “who is the owner of group X?”, “tell me about the group that starts with XYZ”, and “how many members are in this group?” for immediate context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in logs can highlight information about sign-in logs and conditional access policies applied to your tenant to assist with identity investigations and troubleshooting. Admins must simply instruct their Copilot to “show me recent sign-ins for this user”, “show me the sign-ins from this IP address”, or “show me the failed sign-ins for this user.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs can help isolate anomalies associated with audit logs, including changes to roles and access privileges. Admins just have to ask Copilot to “show me audit logs for actions initiated by this user” or “show me the audit logs for this kind of event”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin, who has identified a risky user under the username ‘rashok’, asks Copilot for the March 5th audit logs for ‘rashok’ to discover what actions that user took while at a heightened risk of compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnostic logs can help assess the health and completeness of your tenant's policy configurations. This helps ensure sign-in and audit logs are correctly set up, and that there are no gaps in the log collection process. Admins can ask “what logs are being collected in my tenant” or “are audit logs enabled” to quickly remediate any gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Copilot in Entra for risk investigation&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better picture of how Copilot for Security can increase the speed at which you respond to identity risks, let’s imagine a scenario in which a user is flagged for having a high-risk level due to several abnormal sign-in attempts. With the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, available in public preview with Copilot for Security, admins can get an analysis of the user risk level coupled with recommendations on how to mitigate an incident and resolve the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot summarizes in natural language why the user risk level was elevated. Then, Copilot provides an actionable list of steps to help nullify the risk and close the alert. Finally, Copilot provides a series of recommendations an identity admin can take to automate the response to identity threats, minimizing exposure to a compromised identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a provisioned pay-as-you-go licensing model&nbsp;that makes Copilot for Security accessible to a wider range of organizations than any other solution on the market. With this flexible, consumption-based pricing model, you can get started quickly, then scale your usage and costs according to your needs and budget. Copilot for Security will be available for purchase April 1, 2024. Connect with your account representative now so your organization can be among the first to realize the incredible benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot for Security helps security and IT teams transition into the age of AI and strengthen their skillsets. This is a huge milestone towards empowering organizations with generative AI tools, and we are so proud to work alongside our customers and partners to bring you a better way to secure identities and access for everyone, to everything.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.</p>
 The Allure of Identity Wallets 
<p>Identity wallets propose an enticing vision: a user-centric model where individuals have full control over their identity credentials, sharing them effortlessly and securely across services and organizations. This concept aligns with the broader trend towards empowering users and enhancing privacy. By consolidating identity verification in a single, secure location, identity wallets seem to offer a panacea for the fragmented, insecure, and cumbersome processes plaguing current online interactions.</p>
 The Core Issue: Authentication Integrity 
<p>However, the rush towards adopting identity wallets overlooks a fundamental flaw in our current cybersecurity infrastructure—the integrity of identity authentication itself and the endless number of protocols. The foundation of any IAM system is its ability to accurately and securely authenticate the identity of users. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly an identity wallet may be, its effectiveness is inherently limited by the reliability of the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>Outside these working groups, &nbsp;reality we face is stark. Phishing attacks, identity theft, and account takeovers are rampant, exploiting weaknesses in password-based systems, biometrics, and even two-factor authentication methods. The security community has long acknowledged these vulnerabilities, yet a truly ironclad solution remains elusive.</p>
 Distraction from the Real Challenge 
<p>The fervor surrounding identity wallets risks diverting attention and resources from addressing the root problem—developing authentication mechanisms that are both impervious to existing threats and adaptable to future challenges. While identity wallets can streamline identity management once a user is authenticated, they do little to enhance the security of the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>This is not to dismiss the potential benefits of identity wallets outright. They represent a significant step forward in managing digital identities. The path forward requires a collective reevaluation of our priorities. The cybersecurity and identity communities must channel iefforts into research and development of authentication technologies that can withstand the sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow. Innovations such as cryptographic proofs, advanced biometrics, and behavioral analytics hold promise, but require significant investment to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, fostering an ecosystem that supports interoperability and open standards will be crucial. This approach will not only enhance the security and usability of authentication methods but also ensure that emerging solutions like identity wallets can integrate seamlessly into the broader IAM framework.</p>
<p>What do you think? Digital wallets and all aspects of IAM will be high on the agenda at KuppingerCole’s European Identity &amp; Cloud EIC2024 conference. There will be opportunities to learn about Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World, to get insights into How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization, to get answers the question: Can you trust AI in IAM? And much more!</p>

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing it? (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-1-d950ae770ef2">Linked&nbsp;here</a>)  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE.  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 2 — the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE  Using narratives, diagrams and images to open a generative dialogue <p>In our first publication we introduced two questions that we are using to navigate towards a foundational logic for Life-Ennobling Economics. In this next post we are using those overall queries to share some initial thoughts, together with the cascading questions that are continuing to arise. A strong reflection at this point is that it’s difficult to express many of the core sentiments of LEE using only words. The articulation of certain ideas feels premature and constrictive and this is something that we want to hold up to the light. On the one hand, it feels important to drive clarity and not to hide behind vague, even poetic phrasing. Yet on the other hand, a sense of humility, awe and deep curiosity makes us reluctant to distil and label these early ideas. How can we adequately express diverse interpretations, yearnings and fears for this future that we are daring to open ourselves towards? How might you as the reader? How might your children, parents or more-than-human relations?</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>In the sections that follow we are outlining three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>3 WORLDVIEW PHILOSOPHIES</p> Philosophy 1 <p>Rooted in the recognition of the full web of life: From violence, scarcity and separation to a thriving planetary community of interbecoming.</p><p>What would it mean to fundamentally reimagine ourselves as permeable, dynamic interbecomings, deeply entwined in diverse right relationships and joyfully part of a full planetary consciousness. This concept challenges the traditional economic view of humans driven primarily by rational, objectified, self-interest. Instead, it suggests a new understanding of self where our individual interests are indistinct from what we can collectively become.</p><p>This shift in perspective would call for a re-evaluation of the infrastructures that shape our lives and identities. It would question how we think about everything; from education and learning, health care and human development to the roles and functions of prisons and the judicial system. For example, what does justice mean in a world where we see ourselves as interconnected becomings?</p><blockquote>What do we mean by when we use the term Interbecoming?</blockquote><blockquote>Interbecoming is an extension of the word Interbe which was invented by the Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh. The becoming element signifies the emergent potential of what it means to verb as a community into the future. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esyQnwz_yJ0">short video</a> he describes how you cannot be by yourself alone, to be you need to be with everything and everyone else and therefore to be means to inter-be.</blockquote> Philosophy 2 <p>Grounded in a non-bounded understanding of value: From extractive profit-driven goals to entangled, intergenerational and distributed value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>In our current economy our measures of success are calculated using a narrow set of accounting rules. This is a collectively accepted norm, but can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or context? In an interconnected world, externalities seem to be a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of profit and GDP. Imagine an economy where value was understood to be attributed to relationships themselves rather than the things that are related? How would our economy behave if the collective goal and source of status was increasing regenerative potential or stocks of&nbsp;care?</p><blockquote>The illogical tyranny of&nbsp;metrics</blockquote><blockquote>“People becoming unhealthy can actually have a positive effect overall on GDP, as revenue from associated healthcare boosts growth. Similarly, the extraction of oil and gas pushes GDP up, while pushing us closer to the precipice of climate breakdown.” — Caroline Lucas, MP (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-07-10/debates/FFE2C4E7-4ED0-4537-BA1F-0DE8B46CA084/EconomicGrowthAndEnvironmentalLimits">UK Parliamentary Debate,&nbsp;2019</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Hazel Henderson’s layer cake was the <a href="https://twitter.com/KateRaworth/status/1528866241683017728">original inspiration</a> behind Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics framework. It is a metaphor for how the current monetised economy (the top layers of cake) are entirely dependent on the non-valued, supportive lower&nbsp;layers.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Annie Spratt</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Philosophy 3 <p>Enabled by technological ecosystems of care: From the utilitarian ‘othering’ of technology to animistic interfaces of wisdom and&nbsp;care.</p><p>The accelerating technological complexity of our world can be seen as a threat. However, it could also offer new opportunities to nurture the capacity of society to understand itself more fully, rather than trying to mould and regulate it. Imagine a future where our governing institutions are empowered to advance and scaffold the continuous learning of a self-aware system. Where we can sense the unique, embodied value of every context, thus fostering care for the entangled impacts, both positive and negative. Ultimately we have a choice; will we use the stunning power of advanced technologies to embrace a new freedom to care, or will we use it to destroy everything we depend on and hold&nbsp;dear?</p><blockquote>Busy fools?</blockquote><blockquote>‘We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom’- E.O.&nbsp;Wilson</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">The Cornerstone Indicators </a>work is an example of participatory dialogues being combined with smart data, to create intuitively understandable multi-contextual indicators of care. In another <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">live initiative</a>, we are exploring ways of linking distributed currencies to participatory governance structures, as a pathway towards stewarding bioregional health.</blockquote>Cornerstone Indicator: the number of people with a dream, plan or goal more than one year into the future. Image: Vlad Afanasiev<p>6 STRUCTURAL SHIFTS</p> Shift 1 <p>Beyond Property: From exerting control over ‘objects’ to seeking reciprocal relationships with the full web of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Words like property and ownership are often associated with ideas of dominion and control, allowing us to treat elements of the living world (such as land and rare earth minerals) as objects. Deep down though, do we really believe that timber holds more value than a forest? Or that a whale’s life is interchangeable with a barrel of oil? What would it mean to explore a world beyond property, a world of self sovereign agents who we are respectfully in treaty&nbsp;with?</p><blockquote>The paradox of individual identity</blockquote><blockquote>The idea of self-sovereign agents is being used to express a conviction that life is not a sum of its constituent parts. Instead, both the whole and the parts co-arise with equal agency. The word identity is derived from the Latin idem, the same and identidem, again and again. We identify ourselves by our internal consistency, but this concept only exists in contrast to external self identifying elements (and vice versa). This idea has been expressed by diverse thinkers from <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-experience-of-meaning/jan-zwicky/9780773557437">Zan Zwicky</a> to <a href="https://www.systematics.org/journal/vol9-2/TheWhole_Bortoft.pdf">Henri Borthoft </a>and is carefully explored by Daniel Wahl in Designing Regenerative Cultures¹ and Iain McGilchrist in The Matter with&nbsp;Things².</blockquote><blockquote>‘To shut ourselves off from these other voices…is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our minds of their coherence. We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human’ — David&nbsp;Abram</blockquote> Shift 2 <p>Beyond Labour: From humans employed as resources to vocations of creativity, purpose and&nbsp;care.</p><p>In our industrialised economies humans are often framed as a functional resource. However, rapidly advancing technologies (such as machine automation and alternative distributed currencies) have the potential to weaken the requirement for labour to service financial capital. What would it mean to emancipate the idea of work from its current focus on hierarchy and external incentives? Could we build a future economy that harnesses our inherent, embodied intelligences and unleashes our intrinsic motivations and ability to discover? Perhaps this would be a future of virtuous flow where human satisfaction is rooted in low impact, transcendent goals.</p><blockquote>Can a state of flow be virtuous?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://timjackson.org.uk/finding-flow-lancet/">Professor Tim Jackson</a> has proposed the concept of flow as a pathway towards sustainable fulfilment.</blockquote> Shift 3 <p>Beyond Extraction: From extractive resource claims to the infinite guardianship of the global&nbsp;commons.</p><p>Even the word resource is innately extractive and predicated on violence. When we see a sentient animal or element of an ecosystem and name it as a natural resource, we are using language to justify collective violence in pursuit of private comfort. We have become highly proficient at accessing diverse fodder for the global economic supertanker; from the deep sea beds to the depths of the Amazon rainforest nowhere is considered too difficult to access if the price is right. What would happen if we erased ‘resource’ from our active vocabulary, and redirected our ingenuity toward stewarding the global&nbsp;commons?</p><blockquote>Do words&nbsp;matter?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714174/46011659/INAYAN_LANDSCAPE+%281%29.gif/36b31524-6d41-6ed3-8cda-bf444bde3fe0?t=1659621341143">Inayan — “Unethical deeds”</a>: Inayan is a word that doesn’t exist in the English language. For the Kankanaey people in the Philippines it expresses a community value of refraining from harmful behaviour towards living and inanimate relations. For example, it is inayan to pollute the&nbsp;rivers.</blockquote> Shift 4 <p>Beyond Private Contracts: From linear agreements that optimise for the few to multi-party, dynamic, digital treaties of&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Many of our existing contracts are structured as bilateral agreements. By design, these agreements ignore the complex interplay of values and the mutual need for care that is integral to most transactions. With the emergence of capabilities such as many-to-many and smart, self-executing contracting, we see an opportunity to revolutionise this root structure of the economy. For example, how would our interactions change if we could easily assemble contracts that recognise relational value? Could we collectively drive a bureaucratic revolution that would create new ways to acknowledge and manage the intricate, entangled flows of&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>Are these new contracts too technical or theoretical to engage&nbsp;with?</blockquote><blockquote>From a conceptual provocation (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons provocation</a>) to a live multi-partner collaboration (<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.notion.site/Beyond-the-Rules-19e692bf98f54b44971ca34700e246fd">Beyond The Rules Portal</a>), we are working out loud to test the theory and practical applications of these new forms of contracting.</blockquote>Credit: Terri&nbsp;Po Shift 5 <p>Beyond Governance: From centralised enforcement to nurturing institutions of stewardship.</p><p>Historically our dominant governance structures have sought to control and instruct. However, with the increasing complexity of both our societal systems and escalating risk pathways, this theory of governance no longer appears viable. From their top-down view, many governments are struggling to intelligently regulate the increasingly complex systems of property that they guarantee.</p><p>The most probable directions of future societal travel do not seem appealing. On the one hand we might fail to resolve our global coordination challenges and continue to experience ever intensifying crises (for example, individual countries reopening coal mines to reduce energy costs in the short-term ). Alternatively, we might find ways to overcome perverse incentives but the means to do so will potentially lead us towards authoritarian dystopias. With this in mind, how can we transition away from a centralised model of control, and embrace a governance style that fosters collective learning and empowers the entire&nbsp;system³.</p><blockquote>Is there an adjacent, third&nbsp;option?</blockquote><blockquote>Consilience: the idea that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can “converge” on strong conclusions.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-neighbourhoods-digital-democracy">In Taiwan</a>, the combination of open data and civic participation has created a transparent governance model that drastically reduced the impact of the Covid-19&nbsp;virus.</blockquote> Shift 6 <p>Beyond Monetary Capital: From the accumulation of financial wealth to a social contract that regeneratively stewards the diverse capitals of&nbsp;life.</p><p>What would it mean if we understood capital wealth as an expression of crystallised suffering? Recognising that financial capital is intertwined and enabled by living and social systems could be an important pivot point towards a future rooted in mutually assured thriving. Perhaps then we would feel empowered to reject a monetary system that continues to colonise, exploit and exclude by design. Imagine how our relationship to financial capital might change if we understood the act of investing to be a commitment to our collective futures? What would a system look like where the ways of creating and stewarding money are decentralised and respectful of incommensurate value&nbsp;flows?</p><blockquote>Is the plurality of existing alternative currencies a blessing or a distraction?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3IuJx8O9o">Bernard Lietaer</a> who co-designed the Euro has proposed three core design principles that fundamentally shape the interaction between money and society: a) who issues a currency, b) the qualities it is given, and c) what it can be used&nbsp;for.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">this provocation</a> we explore 10 design principles that could underpin a cohesive yet diverse regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.</blockquote> What’s next and how can people become involved? <p>We have created these first two sections as a landing point for the LEE movement. The idea will be to leave this initial piece in its original form and update the links to new materials as they emerge. What happens next depends on who engages and in what capacity. When we initially proposed the idea, we had imagined that LEE might manifest as a collaborative book and we are still open to that possibility. However, we feel strongly that whilst a tangible artefact would be a powerful tool, it should not be the end goal. Instead, we are aspiring to create a container that can scaffold a distributed exploration and implementation of LEE principles.</p><p>Publications in the&nbsp;pipeline</p><p>We are working on the following pieces and will publish them&nbsp;soon:</p>  Exploratory conversations with critical friends who have read the early versions of the LEE&nbsp;concept.  An outline of how Dark Matter Labs is organising itself to work on the questions raised by the&nbsp;LEE.  Internal conversations: what would it mean for the different strands of our work if we embraced Life-Ennobling Economics as our overarching mission?  <p>Potential pathways for engagement</p><p>We are interested to hear diverse perspectives and will adjust our approach depending on the feedback we receive. As an initial prompt perhaps one of these descriptions is relevant to&nbsp;you:</p><blockquote>Funding support: we are hoping to convene a partnership of funders who can support, elevate and actively contribute to this vision. The scope of ambition is wide but we will curate the process as a series of modular steps. If you are interested in supporting us, either as a general contribution or as a standalone module, then we would be very happy to discuss your ideas. Email: jayne@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Collaborative support: We expect to organise a series of diverse gatherings and working groups. As a first step we will create a live database of potential collaborators and propose a series of online and in-person events following initial conversations. If this is something you would like to hear more about, we would be grateful if you could send us a short email to let us know your area of interest. Email: emily@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Staying updated: our hope is that the ongoing LEE work will provide a convening point for a wider body of thinking on alternative economies. Please feel free to send us your email contact and we will keep you updated on progress and new publications.

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it?  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the LEE (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-2-da43434545c8">linked&nbsp;here</a>).  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 1 — Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it? <blockquote>The term life-ennobling is in itself an adjacent extension of <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2023/02/07/ruthie-wilson-gilmore-abolition-geography%EF%BF%BC">Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s work</a> on life-affirming institutions.</blockquote><p>Our economic systems are failing to serve the interests of our living planet and the great majority of those who inhabit it. It is not our intention to restate the multiple crises that this mismatch has fuelled and continues to perpetuate. Instead, we are sharing our emerging thinking as we strive to build pathways towards alternative ways of organising society. Reading this opening paragraph you may already be holding many questions. For&nbsp;example:</p>  ‘Surely we don’t need yet another type of economics?’.  ‘We already have Doughnut Economics, Wellbeing Economics, Solidarity Economics, Ecological Economics — the list goes on — wouldn’t it make more sense to focus on implementing their principles rather than proposing a new version?’  ‘What gives Dark Matter Labs the authority to suggest a new form of economics? This seems like an audacious and perhaps even arrogant proposal to&nbsp;make.’  <p>We are holding many of these questions ourselves and fully acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of giants. LEE draws on the work of intersectional scholars, feminist and ecological economists and fuses their insights with indigenous wisdom, the life-affirming passion of the abolitionists and the dynamism of radical technologists.</p><p>As we move deeper into the work we are planning to weave the questions and wisdom of our ecosystem into the things that we are learning. We will embrace the friction that comes with an organic conversation and share this unfolding journey using different mediums. If you have comments on the content, or ideas to shape the format of the conversation, then we would welcome feedback.</p>Credit: Martin&nbsp;Lorenz The concept <p>We are proposing Life-Ennobling Economics as a unifying vision and as a call to action. It is an ennobling invitation to break free from ideological constraints, to embrace the radical potential of new technologies, and to challenge the structural codes of our current socio-economic systems. Implicit in this opening position is an understanding that the structure and values of the economy must be in service to all forms of life (present, future, human, non-human and machine) providing a scaffold of care and&nbsp;respect.</p><p>One way of understanding LEE is as a series of linked questions:</p>  What would a desirable future economy actually look&nbsp;like?  What would need to shift for that to become a&nbsp;reality?  What does that mean in the context of our current socioeconomic and political reality?  What can we build or seed to test those assumptions?  <p>We have started to explore these questions as part of our own organisational strategy. We have visualised our response as a 3D matrix and we will publish more about this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>To open the dialogue with a wider audience we are testing three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a reality. The aspiration is to begin building and testing elements of these proposed shifts on the ground, in diverse contexts and communities.</p> What are the core elements of the hypothesis? <p>We are presenting the opening hypothesis as three short sections: (1) an overall framing (2) a philosophical framework (3) an action orientated scaffold. In some places we have included links to more in-depth content and we will expand on the concept in our upcoming publications, including a series of conversations with critical&nbsp;friends.</p><blockquote>1. Overall&nbsp;framing</blockquote><blockquote>The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house</blockquote><blockquote>— Audre&nbsp;Lorde</blockquote><p>The central augment being put forward by the LEE is that whilst we indisputably need to shift to a new economy, we will not get there using the mental models, tools or value systems of the current one. If we allow ourselves to sit with this statement for a moment, how do we feel? Possibly a sense of deflation, frustration or hopelessness. This is not our intention. Rather, we are proposing that we allow ourselves to lean into the idea of a beyond paradigm movement of unusual allies. Donella Meadows retrospectively adjusted her <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">thesis ↗</a> to include an additional level that she named the power to transcend paradigms. Building on this insight, LEE is inviting us to explore what could happen if we allow ourselves to sense into the edges of everything that we are capable of becoming. From nature rights activists and abolitionists to the advocates of self sovereign technologies and universal basic income, many diverse voices are advocating for a common shift. What might be unlocked if we could collaborate across a broad spectrum of unusual&nbsp;allies?</p><blockquote>2. A philosophical framework</blockquote><p>Iain McGilchrist has commented that in modern society we are living under a philosophical error that is far from abstract and instead runs deep to the way that we experience the world¹. Collaboratively building a coherent philosophical base for a more generative future feels critical, because it is this foundational logic that shapes the more tangible layers of our societies. For example, if we start from a value system that promotes individualism and competition then we are likely to design narrow indicators of progress such as GDP, that further entrench these values. In contrast, in a system centred on regenerative vitality we would probably lean towards more embodied measures of success, thus reinforcing the interconnected basis of societal wellbeing².</p><p>To begin exploring and crafting a shared philosophical baseline we are using the following questions to frame our opening thoughts:</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation, what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>We are deliberately using a beyond x,y,z rather than a steps towards framing to explore the proposed structural shifts. We hope that this will encourage a less prescriptive and declarative mindset as we consider what we might collectively work towards. For&nbsp;example:</p>  What could be unlocked if we looked beyond our current understanding of terms such as natural resources, money, institutions and governance?  How can we ensure that voices from the ideological left or right, those who are privileged or oppressed, indigenous or geographically separated can are respectfully represented within the LEE framework?  What might we imagine (or perhaps glimpse existing fragments of) if we let go of a solution oriented&nbsp;mindset?  Are there already existing pockets of these alternative worldviews spread across diverse communities?  <blockquote>3. An action oriented&nbsp;scaffold</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve been told repeatedly that the current political economy can provide the answers, ignoring systematic faults and invested interests in the way of change. Isn’t the real question here then, how we go about redesigning this political economy in a way that includes other voices, values, and&nbsp;ideas.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Gail Bradbrook</blockquote><p>Establishing a strong theoretical baseline is a priority for this initiative, but it also feels important to begin testing and elevating alternative pathways. There is already a stunning global constellation of organisations, movements and thinkers who are actively embodying regenerative crafts and values (for example we recently mapped actors <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=sharing">working on a just transition for housing</a> in Europe). We hope that by broadening the conversation, welcoming unforeseen allies and recognising diverse interests, the LEE can contribute to strengthening this distributed network.</p><p>An initial suggestion for this scaffold is to think of it as two connected threads:</p>  Case studies: we cannot be sure of how the future will play out. However, we can draw on historical events and foresight methods to explore the more likely scenarios. What might we discover if we collate an evidence base of existing signals of change from around the world (for example UBI trials and distributed currencies)? Or perhaps we can gain new insights from building out exploratory case studies, over varied time horizons, for specific sectors such as finance and food systems. How could our understanding shift if we embrace practices such as vision-questing, somatic and dream work? Perhaps you have practices or ideas that you think might be powerful for this collective visioning? We would be grateful for any suggestions and references.  Systemic capabilities: building on the case studies, we hope to identify a speculative portfolio of systemic capabilities that can be developed, tested and iterated in parallel to the existing system. Potential pathways might include designing large scale participatory dialogues, launching transitional financial instruments or developing the policies and tools for distributed decision making structures.   Living the questions <p>In Part 2 of this post we have illustrated our current understanding of some of the questions raised above. We are also working on a series of conversations where we will present some initial reactions to this proposal and explore the points of resonance and friction.</p><p>This blog was designed and written by Martin Lorenz, Emily Harris and Indy Johar as part of Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB.</p><p>The list can never be complete but to the following, thank you for your wisdom, foresight and work — your voices have given shape and clarity to the LEE concept: Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Ilya Prigogine, Stuart Kauffman, Hermon Daly, James Lovelock, Donella Meadows, Kate Raworth, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Fritjof Capra, Daniel Wahl, Katherina Pistor, Aime Cesaire, Iain McGilchrist, Tim Jackson, Nora Bateson, Elinor Ostrom, Sheila Watt-Cloutier, E.

<p>Since its rollout in 2019, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G wireless networks</a> have been growing in both availability and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/5g-use-cases/">use cases</a>. Apple was one of the first manufacturers to test the appetite for 5G in 2020 by offering its newest iPhone with 5G compatibility. From there, the floodgates opened, and today as much as <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/5g-device-outlook">62% of smartphones are built with 5G connectivity</a> (link resides outside ibm.com.) The number of networks also continues to grow, with many popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Verizon, Google and AT&amp;T, offering 5G connectivity in both homes and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does the future hold in store? 5G has been hailed as a disruptive technology, comparable to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI</a>), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> in terms of the kinds of change it will bring about. How much of that is true and how much is just hype? To answer that question, we first must look at how 5G works and what makes it different than other technologies.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p>5G (fifth-generation mobile technology)&nbsp;is a new standard for cellular networks developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3FPP) in 2018 to replace the previous standards of 3G, 4G and 4G LTE. Its goal was to define a new set of standards for devices and applications compatible with 5G networks. Like its predecessors, 5G uses radio waves to transmit data. However, because of improvements in latency, throughput and bandwidth, 5G networks can reach much faster download and upload speeds, giving it a much wider range of applications. &nbsp;</p>



 How is 5G different from previous generations of wireless networks? 



<p>Because of technological improvements, 5G has been praised for its transformative potential across a number of industries. This is largely due to its ability to move large volumes of data swiftly and securely between connected devices at speeds never achieved before. Since the invention of mobile broadband and its gradual expansion into every corner of work and home life, the amount of data generated by the networks and mobile devices running on it has increased exponentially. Today, some technologies (e.g., AI and ML) require too much data to run at speeds offered by previous generations of wireless networks. 5G, on the other hand, with its lightning-fast speeds and high-band frequencies (24GHz–40GHz), is well suited for applications that demand swift, safe access to large amounts of data.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most important differences between 5G and its predecessors:</p>



 
 Smaller physical footprint:&nbsp;5G transmitters are smaller than those on predecessors’ networks, and its “cells”—the geographical areas wireless technology depend on for connectivity—are smaller and require less power. 



 Improved error rates:&nbsp;5G’s adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), a schematic for transmitting data, is more powerful than the schemes used in 3G and 4G networks. This makes its Block Error Rate (BER)—the frequency of errors on its networks—much lower. 



 Better bandwidth:&nbsp;By using more radio frequencies than previous wireless communications networks, including low-band (less than 1 GHz), mid-band (1 GHz–6 GHz) and high-band (24 GHz–40 GHz), 5G can support more devices at the same time. 



 Lower latency:&nbsp;5G’s low&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>—a measurement of the time it takes data to travel from one location to another—is better than on previous networks, making routine activities like downloading a file or working in the cloud much faster.&nbsp; 
 



 How does 5G work? 



<p>Like all other wireless networks, 5G relies on “cells” to function. Within each cell, a wireless device, such as a phone, laptop or tablet, is connected to the internet using radio waves that bounce between a 5G antennae and base station. The same technology that has powered every previous generation of wireless networks also powers 5G, but with some improvements. Notably, 5G networks transmit data as fast as 10 or even 20 gigabits per second (Gbps)—more than 100 times faster than 4G.</p>



<p>As the number of devices built for 5G technology increases, so does demand for the networks themselves. In North America, all the popular telecommunications companies offer 5G now, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">covering more than 200 million homes and businesses</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), with that number projected to double in the next four years.</p>



<p>Here are three critical areas where 5G technology is superior to its predecessors.</p>



 New RAT standard 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks defines the next generation of radio access technology (RAT) specification for all 5G mobile networks. Today, 45% of networks worldwide are 5G compatible, with that number forecasted to rise to 85% by the end of the decade according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/network-coverage#:~:text=The%20build%2Dout%20of%205G,around%2085%20percent%20in%202029.">a recent report by&nbsp;Ericsson</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



 Network slicing capabilities 



<p>On 5G networks, telecom operators can offer multiple independent virtual networks (in addition to public ones) on the same 5G infrastructure, allowing users to do more things remotely with greater security than ever before.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>In addition to network slicing, 5G allows users to create private networks with enhanced personalization and security. Enterprises seeking more control and mobility for employees are increasingly turning to private 5G network architectures rather than public networks.</p>



 5G future: Innovations in the coming years 



<p>Interest in 5G networks and the devices and applications that run on them is understandably high among both consumers and business leaders. According to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US50828023">this recent IDC white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), in the US alone, almost 120 million 5G devices were expected to ship by the end of 2023—a 9.3 % increase over the previous year. By 2027, the final year covered in the report, 155 million units are expected to ship, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4%.</p>



<p>Although the same numbers aren’t available worldwide, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1418441/5g-smartphone-penetration-rate-worldwide/">a Statista report</a> (link resides outside of ibm.com) pegs global penetration of 5G compatible smartphones at 59% in 2023, with that number expected to reach more than 82% by 2027.</p>



<p>But going beyond the numbers, what does this surge in interest really mean? Sometimes, with new technologies, it can be hard to separate what’s real from all the excitement. Here’s a closer look at some of the areas 5G is expected to impact and the likely changes it will bring.</p>



 Healthcare 



<p>In the healthcare industry, 5G is already enabling greater efficiencies, deeper insights from data, and improvements in patient outcomes. Its low latency, high speed and increased bandwidth will help doctors discover new treatments, perform critical procedures remotely using robotics, and access patient information in the field no matter where they are.</p>



<p>More specifically, 5G will continue to do the following:</p>



 
 Add to the number of IoT devices used to remotely monitor patient health. 



 Supply dependable connectivity with real-time results, enabling staff to make faster, more informed decisions about patient care. 



 Transmit HD photos and videos—such as X-rays and mammograms—swiftly and securely so their results can be read remotely. 
 



 Supply chains 



<p>As 5G connectivity spreads, supply chains everywhere will benefit from its lightning-fast speeds and increased reliability. Since the networks that global trade depends on are increasingly digitized, they’re more reliant than ever on high-speed data transmission capabilities and 5G speeds to function. The more digitization and automation in a supply chain, the more 5G can be leveraged to increase efficiencies, reduce costs and increase security. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, 5G service is already being used in airports, ports, train stations and other logistics hubs critical to supply chain infrastructure, but its potential has barely been tapped. Soon, expect 5G connectivity to play a bigger role in enhancing both the employee and customer experience. Programs already being piloted include IoT devices, such as shelf sensors that know when an item is out of stock and re-order it immediately, cashier-less checkouts, and HD cameras and drones to replace security guards.</p>



 Fixed wireless networks 



<p>The concept of ‘fixed’ wireless connections—an internet connection that delivers a seamless wireless experience in a home or business via radio waves rather than through cable or fiber—can help deliver the internet cheaply to more people and places. In a fixed 5G ecosystem, an antenna is attached to a house or place of business that connects to the nearest 5G transmitter. 5G fixed wireless networks can deliver the same speeds, connectivity and reliability as fiber or cable connections at a fraction of the cost. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/expanding-mobile-broadband-coverage-lifting-millions-out-poverty">a recent World Bank blog</a> (link resides outside of IBM), providing internet connectivity—and specifically wireless access—helps lift millions out of poverty every year. A 5G technology that can deliver the same benefits at a much lower cost to millions of people could be a game-changer, bringing the benefits of internet connectivity to communities that have been living without it for years.</p>



 Smart cities 



<p>Perhaps no other environment is poised to change as much due to 5G connectivity as crowded urban centers where foot and car traffic have long led to congestion, air and noise pollution. 5G is already helping cities improve traffic flow and air quality with sensors connected via the IoT, but the future will likely bring much more innovation to this space.</p>



<p>One of the biggest areas where smart cities can leverage 5G more is in its AI capabilities. Currently, programs are being tested that would see 5G-enabled AI assist in everything from smarter energy management to the routing of 911 calls. In Vienna, <a href="https://www.wien.gv.at/english/bot/index.html">WienBot, an AI chatbot</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), helps users solve problems as simple as finding the nearest drinking fountain or a place to eat dinner to as complex tasks as renewing their passport and obtaining travel visas.</p>



 Edge computing and AI 



<p>Finally, edge computing—a computing framework that relies heavily on 5G to perform computations closer to data sources—is poised to help enterprises achieve unprecedented control over their data and extract insights even faster than they already are. One area where edge computing is particularly well-positioned for growth is cloud computing, where AI requires large amounts of power to handle the data it’s tasked with analyzing. Here, 5G connectivity and reliability is key to realizing value for the enterprise. For example, sending data from one point to another in a chat or personal finance application requires additional power and resources that aren’t necessary if the data is being analyzed at its source.</p>



<p>Soon, it’s possible that edge computing will make real-time AI analysis of large volumes of data a reality for everything from fitness and health apps to remotely operated vehicles like satellites and drones. Given its potential, utilizing 5G-enabled edge computing is quickly becoming the standard for enterprise data processing. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">this Gartner white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge (compared to only 10% today).</p>

 Stakers can claim DF80 rewards. DF81 runs Mar 14— Mar 21, 2024. DF Main 2 is&nbsp;here  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions via Predictoor.</p><blockquote>As of this DF round (DF81), <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">DF Main 2 is here</a>. OCEAN rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 80 (DF80) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 7, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 14. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF81 is live today, March 14. It concludes on March 21. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF81   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF81 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Any OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF that wasn’t rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN per week. Expected APY &gt;&nbsp;20%  Summary <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts (round DF81). Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Contents<br>1. <a>Overview</a><br>2. <a>Reward Budgets &amp; APYs</a> <br>3. <a>How to Data Farm</a><br>4. <a>Conclusion</a><br>(Plus Appendices)  1. Overview <p>Data Farming is Ocean Protocol’s incentives program. Participants earn OCEAN rewards for locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Predictoor</a>).</p><p>DF’s first round (DF1) launched on June 16, 2022 with 10,000 OCEAN/week rewards. DF went through alpha and beta to the final “DF Main” phase. DF Main has sub-phases 1-4:</p>  DF Main 1 had 150,000 OCEAN/week rewards.  ⭐ DF Main 2 has 300,000 OCEAN/week rewards. It starts today, March 14, 2024, in DF round 81 (DF81).⭐ Bonus: 20,000 ROSE/week thanks to Oasis&nbsp;🙏  DF Main 3 starts six months later, with 2x more rewards. DF Main 4 is six months after that, with another 2x. The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/reward-schedule">Reward Schedule docs</a> have&nbsp;details.  <p>DF is evolving. At first, DF exclusively rewarded data curation. Now, it also rewards locking OCEAN and making predictions. We can expect further evolution.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes DF reward budgets and expected APYs. Section 3 describes how to data farm, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">the webapp</a>. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Reward Budgets &amp;&nbsp;APYs  2.1 Budgets per&nbsp;Stream <p>The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> 2.1 APY Estimates <p>As of DF Main 2, how can we expect APY to change? Here’s a quick estimate.</p><p>Today’s rewards increase includes a doubling of Passive DF rewards from 75,000 OCEAN/week to 150,000 OCEAN/week. So APY for Passive DF will jump by 2x (all else being equal). If you’ve locked for 4 years to hit max APY, expect APY to rise from ≈10.1% to&nbsp;≈20.2%.</p><p>APY of Active DF is currently ≈3.13%. It’s capped by data consume volume, so we shouldn’t expect it to increase by&nbsp;2x.</p><p>Overall APY is currently ≈12.75% (for max lock time). Given that Passive DF will increase things by (20.2–10.1) = 10.1%, then overall APY will jump to about 22.75% (all else being&nbsp;equal).</p><p>To max your APY, it makes sense to lock OCEAN for long; to curate with all your locked OCEAN; and to run a predictoor bot with aggressive staking.</p> 4. How to Data&nbsp;Farm  4.1 DF Webapp tasks&nbsp;overview <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Volume DF, and Predictoor DF. The DF webapp facilitates most of these; the rest are via Predictoor.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the <a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim”&nbsp;button.  Volume DF. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at&nbsp;once).  Predictoor DF. To earn: become a predictoor by running a bot that makes regular predictions. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Here’s how</a>. To claim: predictoors get paid via sales of the prediction feeds to traders. Predictoor DF is treated as extra&nbsp;sales.  <p>The subsections that follow elaborate on key&nbsp;steps.</p> 4.2 Navigating to DF&nbsp;webapp <p>You can get to the DF webapp from the main Ocean Protocol site <a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com,">oceanprotocol.com,</a> and clicking on “STAKE&nbsp;OCEAN”.</p><p>Or, you can go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">df.oceandao.org</a>.</p>Getting to Data Farming page from main Ocean site (<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a>) 4.3 DF Webapp&nbsp;homepage <p>Here’s the DF webapp homepage.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF webapp&nbsp;homepage</a> 4.4 DF Webapp for Passive DF /&nbsp;veOCEAN <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Passive-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">df.oceandao.org/passive-df</a>.</p><p>This page’s main role is to let you lock OCEAN to get veOCEAN. It allows you to explore “what-if” scenarios: you can lock for different durations, with different OCEAN amounts, and different # compounds; and it will tell you the expected OCEAN rewards and APY (including accounting for gas&nbsp;fees).</p><p>This page also lets you track your veOCEAN balance, lock more OCEAN, and lock for&nbsp;longer.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.5 DF Webapp for Volume&nbsp;DF <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Volume-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">df.oceandao.org/volume-df</a>. To participate in Volume DF, you need to allocate your veOCEAN to data assets. The higher the volume the asset, the more you earn: this is curation.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.6 DF Webapp for Claiming&nbsp;Rewards <p>Click the pink “Claim All” buttons on the homepage to claim OCEAN rewards. The image below illustrates.</p><p>Where to claim? All earnings for data farmers are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. This is the case even though data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon, etc. All rewards come through Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>When to claim? There are fresh passive rewards available every Thursday. If you wish, you can wait for many weeks to accumulate before claiming. (It’s all on-chain.) Predictoor rewards can be claimed at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>When to do a first claim? From the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. The nerdy version: if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first weekly ve “epoch” that begins after day x+7. This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">here’s the&nbsp;code.</a></p> 5. Conclusion <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts. Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  There is no minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia.  The definition of VASPs in Estonia now covers a wider array of crypto services, expanding AML compliance requirements.  Licensing fees and capital requirements for crypto businesses have been increased in&nbsp;Estonia.  <p>In 2017, Estonia became the first country to set the European legal framework for virtual currencies. The country then enacted amendments to its anti-money laundering (AML) legislation that define cryptocurrencies as value represented in digital form that is digitally transferable and acceptable as a payment instrument but not a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>In the following year, the European Union (EU) <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">adopted the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>, which introduced AML and know-your-client (KYC) obligations for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. To comply with the EU directive, Estonia made changes to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, which were implemented in March&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Since then, Estonia has started treating virtual currency service providers as “financial institutions,” subjecting them to the same reporting regulations and requirements as other financial institutions within the&nbsp;country.</p><p>In March 2022, Estonia further tightened its regulations with <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112032022002">amendments to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act</a>. These amendments enforced the FATF Travel Rule, set more stringent licensing conditions for crypto service providers, and broadened the AML Act’s reach to include new virtual currency services.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia <p>By introducing <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, Estonia expanded the definition of “virtual currency service” to include virtual currency transfer services and services related to the issuance of virtual currency.</p><p>Based on the changes, intermediaries between buyers and sellers and services that bring buyers and sellers together, decentralized platforms, services that delegate transactions to third parties, ICO platforms, and other similar services all fall under the VASP category. Hence, they must comply with AML and licensing requirements.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators raised the cost of obtaining a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license to €10,000. They also set a minimum share capital requirement of €100,000 for licensees and introduced a new administrative fee for changes in crypto-related activities.</p><p>Businesses also had to submit extra documents, such as a two-year business plan, financial details, descriptions of the information technology systems for identifying and monitoring transactions, information about customers and their beneficial owners, and details required for fulfilling the Travel Rule obligation.</p><p>Moreover, regulators updated the management board requirements and introduced additional grounds for refusing or revoking a VASP&nbsp;license.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Having implemented the FATF Travel Rule in March 2022, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) gave crypto businesses only three months, up until June 15, 2022, to enforce the rules. However, there is no minimum transaction threshold for reporting transactions.</p><p>Under the Estonia Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs must collect data on a transaction’s originator and share it with the service provider of the transaction’s recipient when completing a virtual currency exchange or transfer. For legal persons, the information to be gathered and shared includes:</p><p>- Full Name &amp; Place of&nbsp;business</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Registry code or residence country identifier</p><p>Meanwhile, the information to be collected for natural persons includes:</p><p>- Full&nbsp;Name</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Identity number and personal identification code</p><p>- Date of birth, place of birth, and residential address</p><p>To comply with the Travel Rule and avoid license revocation, VASPs must maintain accurate records. While transactions involving private wallets are not directly covered by the rule, VASPs initiating such transactions are obligated to perform risk assessments.</p><p>Additionally, the revised AML Act imposes stringent penalties for non-compliance. Fines can reach up to €400,000, with additional penalties of up to 300 fine units (€4 per unit) for violations, including failing to meet capital requirements, neglecting VASP duties, and creating anonymous wallets or accounts.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Estonia, the Crypto Travel Rule applies to all VASPs operating within its borders, including foreign VASPs, which must register locally to offer their services. VASPs here means crypto exchanges, crypto transfer providers, and any services related to virtual currency issuance.</p><p>Initially, Estonia offered two different licenses to crypto exchanges depending on their functions: the Exchange Service License and the Wallet Service License. However, it has now changed to just one license: the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange&nbsp;License.</p><p>To apply for the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange license, VASPs must meet stringent requirements that cover but are not limited to the following:</p><p>- The virtual currency company should be registered in&nbsp;Estonia.</p><p>- The company’s business plan must include its intended business activities as well as operational procedures and expected spending.</p><p>- A description of the information technological system and other systems to be used to operate the business.</p><p>- The company’s intended security measures to protect customer&nbsp;assets.</p><p>- Information about the company’s assigned audit firm, including their name, personal identity code, or personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>- A share capital of at least EUR 100,000 for exchange services and EUR 250,000 for transfer services.</p><p>In transactions involving unhosted (non-custodial or self-hosted) wallets, Estonian VASPs are not obliged to transmit detailed personally identifiable information (PII). However, they must assess the transaction’s risk, retain essential information about both the transaction’s originator and beneficiary, and provide this data to regulatory or supervisory bodies when requested.</p><p>While PII from the beneficiary is not always mandatory in transactions from self-hosted wallets, the originator must supply PII when transferring to a VASP. Additionally, transactions of high value or those conducted frequently may require the beneficiary’s PII as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Context and Comparison <p>The FATF guidance and various global regulators further stipulate that VASPs must apply the Travel Rule to transactions above the $1,000 threshold. This minimum requirement varies based on jurisdictions. For instance, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">in the US</a>, this limit is higher at $3,000, while some jurisdictions, like Estonia, do not have one at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Moreover, contrary to the guidance of FATF, Estonia doesn’t need VASPs to gather and share any personal information about the Beneficiary customer. Most jurisdictions require the beneficiary’s name to be obtained and transmitted. This may cause issues when an Estonia exchange exchange interacts with a foreign exchange, as they may reject the transaction that has no information about the beneficiary.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>By enforcing the FATF Travel Rule and revising its AML laws, Estonia has set a framework that necessitates a detailed approach to transactions and service provider operations. These regulations aim to ensure transaction transparency and combat financial crimes, posing challenges for both regulators and industry participants to navigate this evolving landscape. In this evolving regulatory landscape, any actions taken must be carefully considered for their impact, with a focus on maintaining both security and a positive user experience.</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q1: What is the FATF Travel Rule, and how does it apply in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share transaction data between senders and receivers for transparency. In Estonia, this rule applies to all transactions regardless of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: Who is considered a VASP under Estonian regulations?</p><p>In Estonia, the definition of a VASP is broad, including crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and any service related to the transfer, exchange, or issuance of virtual currencies.</p><p>Q3: What are the licensing requirements for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>Crypto businesses must obtain a VASP license, meet criteria such as a minimum capital requirement (which varies by service type), and pay a licensing fee, which has been increased to ensure only compliant entities&nbsp;operate.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust. It is a public protocol designed to drive data discoverability and compliance into blockchain while preserving privacy and sovereignty. SHFT is its native token and fuel of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Shyft Network facilitates the transfer of verifiable data between centralized and decentralized ecosystems.

<p>Suppose you’re a growing company. Then you’ve got a growing Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problem–because that happens when you grow. You’ve probably been using a combination of spreadsheets, emails, checklists, and half-remembered procedures to handle onboarding, offboarding, and compliance audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then along comes an IAM vendor who pitches their shiny identity provider service: a vision of IAM nirvana with automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and access requests. All you have to do is sign up and push a couple of buttons. (After you pay them, of course.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what the IAM vision looks like:</p>
 
 One Platform, Seamless Control: Manage all your SaaS applications’ identities and access in a single, centralized IAM platform. No more jumping between different tools or spreadsheets. 
 Automated Efficiency: Streamline user access with automated provisioning and de-provisioning across all connected applications. Forget manual tasks and ensure instant access when needed. 
 Cost-Effective Security: Secure your SaaS environment without breaking the bank. Expect transparent pricing for essential IAM features like SCIM/SAML support. 
 
<p>Great vision. But according to the customers we’ve talked to, it’s a mirage.</p>
<p>Here’s what IAM reality looked like once they encountered it:</p>
 
 Fragmented Landscape: Many IAM tools only manage a limited subset of SaaS applications, leaving you with a patchwork of tools and manual processes for the rest. 
 Paywalled Integrations: Access to crucial features like SCIM/SAML often requires upgrading to more expensive tiers with your SaaS providers. 
 Inconsistent Implementation: Even when available, SCIM/SAML implementations can vary significantly between SaaS providers, causing compatibility issues and integration headaches. 
 Manual Mayhem: Unsupported applications force admins to resort to manual workarounds, relying on static documentation and informal communication (emails, Slack, spreadsheets) to manage access, leading to inefficiency and security risks. 
 
<p>So they experience IAMBM – an acronym I just made up for Identity and Access Management Buyer’s Remorse. Automating a chaotic, uncontrolled, disorderly process does not make it harmonious, controlled, or orderly. You replace a messy manual mess with a messy automated mess.</p>
<p>Bill Gates said it right: “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting the Paradigm 
<p>Consider orchestration before automation. YeshID’s orchestration lets you capture and organize your tasks in playbooks. As you organize your activities–in one place, with a single source of truth–you can automate when it’s cost-effective, convenient, and technically feasible. You can integrate manual processes, partly automated processes, and completely automated processes using a single interface. Orchestration lets you delegate tasks, follow up, and distribute work without losing visibility and control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestration will make your IAM activities transparent, orderly, distributed, and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IAM is about people, not just technology. Don’t fall into the automation trap. By empowering your team and focusing on clear, trackable processes, you can achieve secure and efficient access management without the “buyer’s remorse” hangover.</p>

<p>How do we prove who we are in an increasingly digital world?&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of identity has evolved from social constructs to centralized digital profiles defined more by technology companies than individuals themselves. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to put personal ownership back into the equation through emerging solutions centered around distributed ledger technology and cryptography.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conversation that ranged from philosophy to blockchain technology, Lohan Spies discusses how SSI and related innovations might empower youth in developing nations, enable marginalized populations’ participation in regulated economies, and help regenerate land while fighting climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, complexities around public/private key management, unintended consequences of new systems, and the excitement of driving real global change through collaboration come clearly into focus.</p> Defining Digital Identity <p>The concept of identity has shifted greatly in the digital age. As Spies explains, "The traditional way for identity was very much a social construct." People associated names and faces and built interpersonal trust through repeated interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet lacked an innate understanding of identity, however; online systems resorted to centralized user profiles attached to email addresses, unique IDs controlled more by service providers than individuals.</p><p>This approach enabled security risks, data breaches, and unilateral account shutdowns without recourse. Spies contrasts these realities with self-sovereign identity "where you have full control and ownership of your identity, meaning nobody can take it away from you." Control and ownership sit right at the crux of the philosophical and practical divide.</p> Realizing the Potential of Self-Sovereign Systems <p>For digital identity solutions to reach their full potential, Spies believes several essential ingredients need to coalesce. "The first thing that's extremely important is that we do have standards and video specifications," he explains, "because that is the one thing that aligns us or not."</p><p>However, Spies cautions against rigid standardization stifling innovation, noting that "some people might have a different view...but ultimately, I think we're going to get to a point where we will diverge into a common understanding of what's acceptable and what's not acceptable."</p><p>This balanced approach allows for experimentation on the fringes by "people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases" while still working towards interoperable frameworks.</p><p>“The hope is...it aligns us,” Spies notes of identity standards while allowing for “people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases” on the fringes.</p><p>Second, spreading access to cryptography and related capabilities helps empower individuals rather than leaving specialized knowledge in the hands of a small subset of people.&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote>“We kind of call it democratizing in a way, the concept of cryptography,” Spies explains regarding this drive to distribute understanding and control, “really giving it to everyone to leverage and utilize to their own benefit.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Finally, governance structures need to evolve in tandem with technological ones. From local contexts to national digital identity initiatives spanning public and private entities, multipronged coordination paves the road to real-world adoption.</p><p>The payoff of this coordination could prove immense in daily life for everyone. Imagine crossing borders digitally rather than waiting in queues. Consider accessing regulated financial systems regardless of formal government identification documents. Or think about connecting payments directly, not just to account numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the realm of payments, self-sovereign identity could enable direct transactions without relying on intermediary institutions. "I think there's just a natural progression to bring identity and payments closer together," Spies explains.</p><p>Rather than sending money to an account number and routing through banks or payment apps, funds could move directly between verified individuals. The secure digital identities of self-sovereign systems would serve in place of centralized platforms that currently mediate transactions.</p> Use Cases, Obstacles, and Promise <p>If coordinated properly, self-sovereign systems could greatly benefit populations in need across the globe. Spies points to the <a href="https://www.generationunlimited.org/yoma?ref=blog.holochain.org">YOMA project from UNICEF</a>, which empowers youth in developing countries, where he is working to help integrate digital identity technology to increase access to education and employment credentials.</p><p>Other models help shift marginalized groups away from all-cash economies into greater digital inclusion. Environmentally, distributed identity solutions offer promise by securely tracking and verifying sustainability data. Spies details one such application in regenerative agriculture:</p><p></p><blockquote>"From the ground, it's verifiable data...we can make sure that a human or IoT device can be identified and how we can make sure that that data feeds up into the chain of various layers. But we know we can trust the data that originated from the ground."</blockquote><p></p><p>This trusted provenance allows for the creation of what Spies calls "nature certificates," which go beyond traditional carbon credits:</p><p>Of course, obstacles remain in these early days. Complexities of public/private key management persist, though various startups work toward solutions. Mainstream understanding and education around the relevance of self-sovereign systems currently fall short as well. As the internet’s unintended impact shows, we must take care to avoid exclusion where promises of inclusion abound.</p><p>However, with expanding real-world deployment comes cause for optimism. Spies expresses excitement “to see this technology really being adopted, really solving real-world problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>New collaborations between digital identity projects are driving tangible progress in addressing real-world challenges. If holistic human needs and ethical considerations guide developers and adopters alike, efforts like YOMA and Holochain could portend more equitable and empowered societies ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>SAP recently announced the end-of-life of their SAP Identity Management solution in 2027, with an extended maintenance period until 2030. With already being in 2024, this leaves three to at maximum six years for migrating SAP Identity Management to another solution. Three years, if avoiding the extended maintenance period and associated cost (even while the premium is only slightly above the regular maintenance fee), is not long enough for the transition of an IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solution. In other words: It is time to start planning.</p>
 IAM solutions provided by SAP and the SAP solution approach 
<p>SAP recently <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101">proposed a solution approach</a> based on <a href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/cloud-identity-services">SAP Cloud Identity Services</a>. This article has been frequently misinterpreted in saying “SAP endorses a combined solution based on SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID”. In fact, it says that SAP will continue its investment in both SAP Cloud Identity Services and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/cloud-iam.html">SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance</a> (Cloud IAG) and “that these enhancements are designed to facilitate integration with other partner identity management solutions, like Microsoft Entra ID, that provide a comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide identity and access scenarios.”</p>
<p>SAP unveils its strategy for the own IAM-related solutions as well as their focus on a flexible integration strategy for scenarios that require IAM capabilities beyond what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide.</p>
<p>SAP Cloud Identity Services are a SaaS solution supporting a good set of IAM capabilities, ranging from Access Management features for authentication and identity federation to SCIM-based provisioning, integrated directory services, and authorization management for Policy-Based Access Management (PBAM). SAP focuses on utilizing open standards, but also on integration to other IAM solutions in the organization. Access Governance features are provided by SAP Cloud IAG, which is primarily focused on the SAP ecosystem and neatly integrates with the SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
 Challenges and limitations 
<p>With SAP itself supporting an integration approach with other identity management solutions “that provide a comprehensive approach”, the question is where such expansion and integration is needed. There are two dimensions to look at. One is the breadth and depth of capabilities that are needed versus what is provided by SAP’s own solutions, which needs a thorough requirements analysis. To keep in mind here: Access Governance capabilities are delivered by the “companion product” SAP Cloud IAG, not by SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
<p>The other is the breadth and depth of integration to target systems. The focus on SCIM-based provisioning is one important area here. While SCIM is increasingly supported by SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, SCIM interfaces are very rarely found in legacy on-premises applications.</p>
<p>A simple rule is: The more non-SAP solutions, the more legacy and on-premises integration, and the larger and more complex the organization is, the more likely such integration approach is needed.</p>
<p>Plus: There are several IAM solutions out there that can cover what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide in capabilities. There are options. And some of them provide very powerful, in-depth support even for complex SAP environments.</p>
 Taking a structured approach 
<p>Don’t oversimplify a decision that will impact your IT for the next 10-15 years at least, when taking common lifetimes of IGA solutions. Analyze the options you have thoroughly.</p>
 
 Start with your overall IAM strategy: How will your Identity Fabric of the future look like? 
 Analyze what you have and what (SAP Identity Manager, due to end-of-life) must change 
 Understand what you will need 
 Go into the detailed analysis of requirements 
 Run a thorough tools choice process to find the right solution 
 
<p>For that tools choice process, best practice for an organization that has SAP Identity Manager in place is to have SAP Cloud Identity Services and Cloud IAG as one of the shortlisted options, amongst other IAM solutions. Such process also will allow you to assess combinations such as SAP Cloud Identity Services in combination with Microsoft Entra ID or other enterprise IAM solutions.</p>
<p>In any case: Don’t take it easy. Spend the time for planning and assessing the options you have, to find the right solution for your enterprise. Impacting factors include aspects such as</p>
 
 The current and future SAP landscape versus a multi-vendor strategy for Line-of-Business applications 
 The complexity of the non-SAP application and system landscape in scope of IAM 
 The state of IAM solutions beyond SAP Identity Manager

<p>Today’s healthcare organizations must address a multitude of high-priority challenges. With competition at an all-time high, healthcare organizations are under pressure to meet patient and member demands for easy, personalized digital experiences. Healthcare providers, workers, and partners are also insisting on seamless digital experiences that streamline their work for greater operational efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the healthcare industry is facing unrelenting cyberattacks that wreak havoc upon patient care, budgets, and business operations. According to the 2024 ForgeRock Breach Report (ForgeRock is now a part of Ping Identity), healthcare systems have remained the number one breach target for over five years.&nbsp; Electronic health records containing personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI), such as medical records and patient data, are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Unauthorized access is the root cause of most breaches – emphasizing the dire need for modern digital identity cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most healthcare organizations are using <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/iam-modernization.html">legacy systems</a> that weren’t built to deliver personalized experiences and secure access for millions of diverse identity types to on-premises, cloud, and SaaS apps from any device, at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a modern, HIPAA compliant <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management.html">identity and access management (IAM)</a> platform should be on every healthcare leader’s radar. Modern IAM is proven to protect sensitive information and data by drastically reducing cyberattacks. It also improves user experience and engagement, such as removing friction from the authentication process, all while protecting sensitive data against ransomware, fraud, and other cyberattacks. HIPAA-compliant IAM platforms also enable healthcare organizations to meet compliance requirements for regulations such as HIPAA, TEFCA, HITECH, the 21st Century Cures Act, and many more.</p>

				  Learn how some educators are taking advantage of new technologies to provide faster student and employee verification and eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>In the US <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/highest-school-enrollment-count.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20college%20enrollment%20remained,percentage%20point%20increase%20from%202020">17.3 million students were enrolled in college</a> in 2022, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184010/school-enrollment-in-public-and-private-institutions-2008/#statisticContainer">17.16 million were enrolled in high school.</a> Each student generates data — such as transcripts of courses taken and grades achieved — all of which will need to be shared and verified over the course of the school year and beyond.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in higher education, colleges in the US received roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2023/03/30/college-applications-are-up-dramatically-in-2023/?sh=6b7324349c4d">seven million applications in 2023,</a> each of which requiring a short list of supporting documents.</p>
<p>Student athletes will need documents for sports they participated in, as well as medical paperwork, such as physicals or injury reports, to be on file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitnux.org/college-housing-statistics/#:~:text=50%25%20of%20college%20students%20in,colleges%20have%20on-campus%20housing">50% of college students who live on campus </a>need an identity and access management system to access dorms, dining halls, labs and libraries.</p>
<p>Each of the <a href="https://educationdata.org/number-of-college-graduates#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20graduates,college%20students%20graduated%20in%202021">4.16 million students who received some level of degree in 2021</a> will need to prove that achievement when they apply for a job and will need to keep supplying that data for many jobs to come.</p>
<p>Employers will want to verify that the degree is real, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-employers-verify-college-degrees#:~:text=This%20type%20of%20check%20is,which%20usually%20incurs%20a%20fee">manual process most often handled by the school records office</a>. This process can take up to <a href="https://clarifacts.com/faqs/education-verification-turnaround-time/#:~:text=Education%20Verification%20Turnaround%20Time&amp;text=The%20normal%20turnaround%20time%20for,or%20state%20and%20federal%20holiday">72 hours</a> unless subject to additional delays such as school holidays, resulting in a lot of work for the school.</p>
<p>Verifying these degrees is not just a “nice to have,” fraudulent degrees and transcripts are estimated to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">seven billion-dollar-a-year industry</a> worldwide, with real impact. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">Thousands of nurses</a> have recently been caught practicing using fake or purchased credentials.</p>
<p>What if there was a really simple way of managing all this, so that all this data was portable, held by the student, and instantly and reliably authenticatable?</p>
<p>How decentralized identity can help</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology is a way to digitize data so that its original source can be cryptographically proven and any attempt to alter it will be caught. It is designed so that a person can hold their own data, locally, on their mobile devices in the form of a verifiable credential. This makes data easy to share directly with other parties, each of whom can verify the authenticity of the data with simple, mobile software. Critically, this system of holding one’s own data, sharing it directly, and verifying it easily means that direct integrations can be avoided (saving money) and third parties are no longer needed as data brokers (simplifying data privacy), — a revolution in data management.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective for an educational institution, paperwork such as grades, transcripts, and diplomas can now be issued to students directly with a verifiable credential. The student or graduate holds their records and shares them with whoever needs the information, such as when signing up for more classes or applying for college or a job.</p>
<p>Similarly, a student’s identity card can be issued as a verifiable credential, meaning educators have a way to verify a student’s identity for access to accounts, buildings, research collections, laboratories, and more. Verifiable credentials can easily be configured with rules to grant and revoke this access and expire upon graduation.</p>
<p>By issuing verifiable credentials for identity and data, an educational institution can remove the need for passwords, locks, key fobs, or access cards, manual checks in the records office, digging through servers, paper documents and more. By issuing degrees through a verifiable credential, any business with the proper verifier agent can immediately know that the information presented to them is trustworthy, removing the need to go back to the school at all.</p>
<p>How Open Badges fit in</p>
<p>Currently, if you want to verify a person’s transcript, diploma, or certificate, you will need to contact whomever issued the transcript or diploma or certificate. This often means contacting them directly.</p>
<p>But what if that issuing party no longer exists? Schools close, businesses go under or become absorbed. Even if the original data exists, it can be time-consuming to track it down.</p>
<p>This is where Open Badges 3.0 comes in. As a type of verifiable credential for storing data about academic achievements, or certifications, an Open Badge credential can be verified without having to directly check in with the institution that issued them, meaning it can essentially “live forever.”</p>
<p>In contrast to earlier versions of the Open Badges format, the badge can be held by its owner and shared directly. Previously, the badge was hosted by a website (with the risk that it, too, could go bust and disappear, taking the credential record with it).</p>
<p>Open badges 3.0 offer a new smart, decentralized way to store transcripts, grades, and diplomas. Even if a school closes, merges with another, or loses the records, the student has a record and can prove what they have accomplished.</p>

 Digital identity pilot implementation to start in Q1 2024: Kick-off with 2,700 citizens from Austria, Romania and Spain to test wallet solution 



<p>Rennes/Munich, March 12, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is pleased to announce the start of the pilot implementation phase for the EU-wide SOTERIA research project which aims to develop a user-centric, citizen-driven tool to help European citizens manage their personal data.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to combine the creation of a digital identity to access online services with a user-friendly platform that allows for secure and easy data management, while increasing citizens’ awareness of their personal data. “SOTERIA is a large scale demonstrator that shows how a digital identity wallet can enable citizens to protect and control their personal data while making access to online services easier than ever before,” says Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow and coordinator of the SOTERIA project.</p>



 E-voting, e-exam, and e-health field tests in three EU countries 



<p>Launched in October 2021, the SOTERIA project is nearing the final pilot implementation and testing phase of the identity wallet solution, which was developed by IDnow and the other SOTERIA partners as part of the project. The wallet will be integrated into the platforms of <a href="https://scytl.com/">SCYTL</a>, <a href="https://ipcenter.international/">IPCenter</a> and <a href="https://www.science.eus/en/institutions/biobizkaia">Biobizkaia Health Research Institute</a> (with the support of <a href="https://infocons.org/">INFOCONS</a> association) in Romania, Austria and Spain, respectively, for use cases in e-voting, e-exam, and e-health.</p>



<p>This month, the three pilot use cases will kick off with field tests consisting of 900 citizens each from Austria, Romania and Spain. For the e-voting and e-exam use cases, participants will authenticate themselves through the SOTERIA app and test the onboarding, which IDnow provides via proven identity verification methods. These include several new security checks developed within the project, reinforcing the fraud detection capability of the solution further. Then the citizens will go through the voting or exam process, and at the end, have the choice to add their voting receipt or their exam results to their wallet. For the e-health trial, citizens will have the possibility to add their health data to their wallet, while choosing the type of data and documents they want to store. This will allow them to have all important health information about themselves in their pockets.</p>



<p>The benefits of this testing phase are twofold: The 2,700 citizens will test the authentication process and the access to an online service with the help of a stored digital identity; while the wallet’s capability to store documents and attributes (e.g., e-voting receipt, e-exam results, e-health data) in the form of verifiable credentials will also be tested. Afterwards, the citizens’ feedback will be analyzed and evaluated by <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en">AUDENCIA</a> and will be used to improve the platform. These findings can then inform the further development of digital identity wallets under the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS2 (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation</a>.</p>



<p>Awal adds: “Thanks to the findings in the use cases with citizens, SOTERIA will help strengthen security, privacy, and personal data protection across all layers of the digital economy, and will help pave the way for a trustworthy EU digital environment. We are very proud that the R&amp;D team at IDnow gets to lead this ambitious consortium of 13 European partners. It is testament to our innovative spirit and curiosity that forms part of our DNA at IDnow.”</p>



 



<p>About SOTERIA</p>



<p>The SOTERIA consortium consists of 13 partners from eight EU countries, composed of small medium enterprises (ERDYN), large enterprises (IDnow, SCYTL, IPCenter.at), universities and research centers (Audencia, KU Leuven, CVC, IDIAP, Inria, Biocruces Bizkaia) and non-for-profit organizations (INFOCONS, STELAR, NORIA Onlus). The project was written and submitted to the European Union in August 2020, following a call for projects by the European Commission on the topics of digital security and privacy for citizens. The SOTERIA project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101018342. More information on the project can be found at <a href="https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/">https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/</a>.<a>[1]</a></p>

<p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app. This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, Bluesky operated by three principles:</p>
 
 Simple and Powerful: Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood 
 User Choice: Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems 
 Openness: Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces 
 
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
 Sensible Defaults with User Choice 
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>

  
  An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.

<p>In the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

  
  Configurable options per label from an example moderation service. 


  
  Example of a post that the moderation service The Chiller has labeled as “rude.”

<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we’re excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky’s moderation service.</p>
<p>For additional information, read our technical explainer for moderation architecture across the AT Protocol <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/blueskys-moderation-architecture">here</a>.</p>
 How will this all work? 
<p>Here’s what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
 From a user perspective: 
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app — as easily as you’d follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky — let’s call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
 From a moderator perspective: 
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>

  
  Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.

<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
 From a developer perspective: 
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.</p>
 FAQ 
<p>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</p>
<p>All users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects.

 How Passwordless IAM Enhances Security 
 Bypassing the Risks of Password-based Systems 
<p>Password-based systems come with inherent risks, such as vulnerability to phishing, brute force attacks, and password fatigue. Passwordless IAM eliminates these risks by removing passwords from the equation entirely. Instead of traditional usernames, authentication methods like biometrics, tokens, or SMS are used to authenticate users, which are not susceptible to the same kinds of attacks as passwords.<br>
In a passwordless environment, malicious actors are deprived of the opportunity to get login credentials, exploit weak passwords to gain access, or use stolen passwords for unauthorized access. This fundamentally enhances an organization’s security posture by bypassing the typical risks associated with password-based systems and data breaches.</p>
 Reducing Threats and Enhancing User Experience 
<p>Passwordless IAM augments security and significantly enhances the user’s mobile device and experience. Users no longer need to remember and manage multiple passwords, simplifying the login process. It also alleviates the common issues related to password resets, lockouts, and password management, streamlining user access to systems and applications.<br>
An improved user experience, combined with more secure authentication factors with advanced authentication methods, strengthens the user’s overall security. Users are less likely to adopt insecure practices such as using weak passwords or reusing passwords across multiple services, contributing to the user’s identity in a more secure environment.</p>
 Success Stories and Learnings from Implementations 
<p>Implementing passwordless IAM has succeeded in various sectors, showcasing its efficacy and reliability. Companies that have transitioned to implement passwordless authentication using IAM have experienced enhanced security, reduced costs associated with password resets, and improved user satisfaction.<br>

 Introduction <p>The Meteorological Aerodrome Report (<a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">METAR</a>) is a globally standardized format for communicating current weather conditions at airports or permanent weather observation stations. This format plays a vital role in aviation, aiding in flight planning and ensuring safety. Composed as a concise alphanumeric code, the <a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">METAR</a> delivers comprehensive meteorological data specific to an airport at a particular moment. These reports, consisting of letters and numbers, are issued every 30 or 60 minutes by airports and airfields.</p>METAR, Miami International Airport (KMIA) on March 9, 2024, at 15:00&nbsp;UTC<p>In the recently concluded data challenge hosted on <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/list">Desights.ai</a>, participants used exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance aviation weather forecasting accuracy. Focusing on Miami International Airport (KMIA), participants analyzed historical METAR reports spanning an entire&nbsp;decade.</p>Image showing the decoded METAR for KMIA on March 9, 2024, at 15:00 UTC, as provided by <a href="http://metar-taf.com">metar-taf.com</a><p>The challenge began with an in-depth exploration of EDA, where participants meticulously examined trends, patterns, and anomalies within the METAR data. Through this process, they gained valuable insights into Miami’s meteorological landscape, including seasonal variations and significant weather events impacting KMIA operations.</p><p>Transitioning to AI and machine learning (ML), participants developed models for precise weather prediction at KMIA. They addressed critical questions about prediction accuracy and model performance across weather phenomena. Additionally, they explored the influence of geographical and seasonal factors on prediction outcomes, aiming to enhance the applicability of their models in real-world aviation scenarios.</p> Winners Podium <p>The podium submissions exemplified ingenuity and precision in aviation weather forecasting. Participants showcased their expertise through innovative approaches, leveraging advanced machine-learning techniques to deliver accurate predictions. Let’s explore the top three submissions that stood out for their excellence and creativity in tackling this complex data challenge.</p> Andrey Bessalov — 1st&nbsp;Place <p>Andrey demonstrated a meticulous and methodologically sound approach to weather forecasting, using three critical&nbsp;stages:</p><p>1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Andrey undertook an extensive data preprocessing exercise to clean and prepare the METAR data for analysis. It involved handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing measurements, and converting various data types. He also applied feature engineering to extract additional information from the data, including time-based features and rolling averages.</p><p>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Development: He performed an exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics of the data, such as the distribution of various weather parameters and their correlations. Patterns and anomalies in the data, like seasonal variations, were identified. Andrey developed a machine-learning model and trained it to predict METAR data for the next hour, comparing different models ( linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) and choosing the best based on performance. He analyzed which features were most influential in predicting weather conditions and evaluated the model based on its accuracy.</p><p>3. Individual Weather Component Analysis and Final Algorithm: The project involved detailed analysis and modeling of various weather components, such as air temperature, dew point, air pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility, rain, fog, thunderstorms, and clouds. Andrey built separate Xgboost models for each component to predict future values one hour ahead. He validated the models using data from 2023, with training data from 2014 to 2022. The final step was the creation of an algorithm to process the data, create features, make predictions for individual components, and then convert these predictions into METAR format for practical use.</p> Dominikus Brian — 2nd&nbsp;Place <p>Dominikus’ primary objectives were to explore the relationships between different meteorological data, uncover statistical patterns influencing weather, and demonstrate the use of historical METAR report data in building a predictive machine-learning model.</p><p>His submission outlined essential findings from the exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development. It employed a Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network to predict next-hour weather conditions around Miami International Airport, revealing that models with shorter memory spans are generally more effective. The study faced challenges in accurately predicting wind direction and cloud types while achieving high accuracy in predicting temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility. Additionally, it observed yearly weather trends, such as an increase in mean temperatures and seasonal variations like stronger winds in the latter half of the year. The study also included correlation analyses showing various relationships between different weather&nbsp;factors.</p><p>His report comprehensively explored employing machine learning in weather forecasting, focusing on Miami International Airport. It highlighted the effectiveness of models with shorter memory spans and the interconnectedness of various weather factors. The insights gained are valuable for understanding meteorological dynamics specific to the airport and developing a machine-learning pipeline for weather prediction. Plans include refining the model’s efficiency and exploring its applicability to other airports, broadening the scope of the study’s utility in aviation and related&nbsp;fields.</p> Anamaria Loznianu — 3rd&nbsp;Place <p>Anamaria presented a structured approach to predicting weather conditions using METAR data. She applied predictive models, including MultiOutputRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to forecast weather values like wind direction, speed, gusts, visibility, temperature, dew point, and pressure. The report mentioned significant discrepancies in some predictions, such as temperature, while acknowledging the better accuracy of models like RandomForestRegressor and&nbsp;LSTM.</p><p>In addition to historical data, Anamaria explored using real-time data from airports surrounding Miami to improve weather predictions. This included a novel approach of using real-time data from nearby airports to refine weather predictions for Miami. She analyzed weather patterns from eight nearby airports and examined how these patterns influenced Miami’s conditions, then aggregated the latest METAR data from nearby airports and analyzed whether weather patterns at these locations influenced Miami’s conditions.</p><p>Her report concluded that while historical data is vital for recognizing patterns, forecasting weather in the short term is most effective when combining current data with the overall direction of weather systems. While the MultiOutputRegressor showed significant discrepancies, especially in temperature predictions, the RandomForestRegressor and LSTM models delivered more accurate results with significantly lower error&nbsp;rates.</p> Interesting Facts  Data Preprocessing and&nbsp;Parsing <p>The challenge required processing approximately 90,000 METAR lines from the Miami International Airport (KMIA) spanning over ten&nbsp;years.</p> General Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The study observed seasonal temperature variations, with Miami experiencing warm, humid summers and mild, dry winters due to its tropical monsoon climate. Rainfall is significant during the summer, while winters are the peak tourist season due to comfortable weather. The city is also susceptible to hurricanes and tropical&nbsp;storms.</p> Yearly Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The report noted an increase in mean temperatures from an average of 25.01°C in 2014 to 26.24°C by 2023. It also highlighted seasonal variations, such as stronger winds in the second half of the year, poorer visibility in fall and winter, decreased air pressure, and more predominantly eastward wind directions towards the year-end.</p> Seasonal Analysis <p>The data showed clear seasonal patterns. The highest temperatures occurred in summer (July-August) and during late afternoons (16:00 to 18:00), while the lowest temperatures were in winter (December-January) and early mornings (6:00 to&nbsp;9:00).</p> Challenges in Predicting Certain Weather&nbsp;Features <p>Among the primary features analyzed (wind direction, wind speed, visibility, cloud types, cloud heights, temperature, dew point, and air pressure), wind direction and cloud types were the most challenging to predict accurately. In contrast, temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility were predicted with high accuracy.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Did you know that our reward structure has changed? The prize pool is now $10,000 for every challenge, and it pays the top 10 participants.</p><p>In addition to the monetary rewards, we’ve also revamped our points system to better recognize our top performers’ achievements. Points will now be awarded to the top 10 finishers in each event, with 100 championship points up for&nbsp;grabs.</p><p>Collect points in each challenge for the 2024 Championship. Last year’s Championships’ top 10 received an additional $10 for every point earned during the&nbsp;year.</p><p>The top 3 in each challenge may work with Ocean on a dApp that monetizes their algorithm.

<p>The health sector faces a staggering array of challenges and consequences in the relentless battle against cyberthreats. Surprisingly, it’s not just a battle against malicious outsiders — within healthcare organizations internal users represent 39% of all threat actors.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human error in the forms of data loss and misuse are the most common ways internal actors pose a threat to the healthcare organizations they work for. With the average cost of a breach at $10.93 million2, it is essential to ensure that healthcare providers, employees, contractors, and partners only have access to the internal apps and systems that they need to do their jobs — and nothing more — to keep the risk of internal threats at bay.</p>

<p>Quick overview: Conventional KYC methods are becoming obsolete. These outdated approaches demand time-consuming, manual processes that are inefficient for banks and tedious for customers. But the new era of KYC is here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials: Reusable credentials are a revolutionary verification solution where the customer only has to verify themselves once. This cutting-edge technology removes friction from operations and fortifies every touchpoint (in the branch, app, contact center, etc.), ensuring heightened security. With reusable credentials, banks can:</p>



 
 Stop fraud by reducing weak security points 



 Take the pressure off your employee&nbsp; and prevent human error 



 Create a better customer experience with seamless processes at every touch point. 
 



<p>Why this matters: This is the next step in identity verification. There is now a way to have less friction without having to sacrifice security through reusable credentials.<br></p>



<p><a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">👀 See how reusable credentials are reshaping bank operations in our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The big picture: Humans are human, which means we can make mistakes or be taken advantage of by social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/state-of-vishing-report/#:~:text=Social%2DEngineer%27s%202023%20State%20of,%2C%20network%2C%20or%20financial%20breach.">State of Vishing Report</a> found a 10% increase in compromises when the fraudulent caller was a female as opposed to a male caller. Reusable credentials instantly take care of this problem. Your customer will have a hyper-secure, encrypted credential that your employee will request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No guesswork is involved. Your customers and employees know that the account is secure.</p>



 Dive Deeper 



 Why the Traditional KYC Methods Are Not Working 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 The Achilles’ heel of current KYC processes is its temporary nature. 



<p>Once the initial identity verification occurs during account opening, it becomes a one-time, non-reusable process. This leaves day-to-day interactions vulnerable, forcing employees to repeatedly verify customer information through methods susceptible to exploitation, such as:</p>



 
 Security questions 



 Teller judgments on IDs 



 SMS verifications 



 Over-the-phone verification. 
 



<p>Using reusable credentials allows customers to be seamlessly verified at every touch point. No reverification. No room for fraud. Only a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Stop Fraud with Reusable Credentials 



<p>In the continual battle against fraud, where every weak link in security can lead to losses, reusable credentials fortify FIs. Traditional KYC methods are vulnerable to social engineering and create an environment where fraud can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A FI employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/19at82r/call_center_loses_1500_in_provisional_credit_to_a/">shared their story</a> showcasing that humans are unfortunately susceptible to social engineering: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[A] member is claiming he attempted a deposit of $2,900 over the long weekend that was not processed … I thought it was a no-brainer. [The] account was [less than] 45 days old, and aside from the initial $10 deposit to open the account there was no other activity. There’s no way a supervisor would agree to PRCR. And yet, when the ticket came in, there was a comment that the Call Center’s director approved a PRCR of $1,500 “so the member can pay his bills.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sure enough, within an hour, the member pulled $800 out at another ATM. A few hours later, another $200. The next day, about a dozen or so $10 withdrawals from Cash App, and finally another ATM [withdrawal] of $330. [The] account now has less than $15.</p>



<p>Any odds on us seeing this $1,500 coming back to us? [The] call center rep feels bad because she is “normally a really good judge of character.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The problem: Weak points of traditional security measures. Security questions, often easy targets for social engineering, can be guessed or manipulated. Bank tellers, despite their expertise, may struggle to differentiate between authentic and forged IDs. SMS-based verifications, a common practice, can expose customers to phishing attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The solution: Embracing reusable credentials that close vulnerabilities for identity verification. By adopting an approach similar to the success of TSA Precheck in travel, banks can usher in a new era of fraud resistance. They provide a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding, making fraud attempts nearly impossible.</p>



<p>Fraud prevention is not just a reactive measure; it’s a company-wide initiative. Reusable credentials significantly reduce the workload associated with fraud-related projects, allowing financial institutions to reallocate resources.</p>

 Take the Pressure Off Your Employees 



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience.</a></p>



<p>The heartbeat of any financial institution is its dedicated workforce, tirelessly navigating the delicate balance between service and security. Traditional KYC and identity verification require manual processes and diverse verification methods that put immense pressure on employees to stop fraud while providing a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials revolutionize this situation by offering a streamlined solution that alleviates the pressure on bank employees. Employees are freed from repeatedly needing to validate customer information with a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding. This shift enhances operations and empowers employees to focus on delivering excellent customer experience.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable Credentials and Decentralized Identity&nbsp; 



What is the reusable credentials process?




 
 The First Identity Verification A decentralized identity (DI) system verifies a customer’s identity during account creation using robust authentication methods. 
 







 
 Creation of Reusable Credentials: Once the identity is verified, the DI system generates a reusable credential. These credentials are encrypted, making them tamper-proof and incredibly secure. 
 







 
 Customer-Controlled Data: Unlike conventional identity systems where the FIs oversee and store user data, decentralized identity transfers this to the customer. For banks, this translates to customers possessing their credentials securely stored on their devices, offering the convenience of storing and presenting credentials directly within your banking app and interfaces. 
 







 
 Persistent Verification: Reusable credentials stop the need for repetitive verification processes. Whether logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, customers simply present their reusable credentials as irrefutable proof of identity. 
 




What are the benefits for banks to use reusable credentials?
 
 Enhanced Security: Reusable credentials reduce reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud, replacing security questions susceptible to social engineering or SMS-based verifications vulnerable to phishing. 
 



 
 Frictionless Customer Experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for bank customers to enjoy continuous and secure interactions across various touchpoints. 
 




How can banks use reusable credentials to prevent fraud?
 
 The Highest Level of Security: Reusable credentials use advanced cryptographic techniques to make information tamper-proof and nearly eliminate the risk of fraud. 
 



 
 Absolute Proof of Identity: Once a customer’s identity is verified and turned into a reusable credential, it becomes irrefutable proof of their identity, minimizing the risk of social engineering or phishing. 
 



 
 Strengthen Security Points: Reusable credentials limit places where fraudulent activities can occur, minimizing potential attack points found in traditional verification methods. 
 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance, including:</p>



 
 Healthcare 



 Government services 



 Education 



 Farming 



 Mining 



 Travel and hospitality 



 Retail and e-commerce 



 Human resources and employment 
 




<p></p>



<p>Although widespread adoption is still evolving, various pilot programs and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving challenges and improving user experiences across industries.</p>

				  Together, Indicio and SITA are changing how we travel —&nbsp;and in doing so, how we can share and trust data to make the world a better place.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>I’m proud to announce that Indicio’s partnership with SITA is deepening with a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">new and important investment</a> in our company.</p>
<p>Both companies have been on an transformative journey for the past four years: making seamless travel a reality. We have developed new solutions to the challenge of digitizing identity documents; we have set new standards for biometrics, data privacy and protection; we have won some of the most prestigious awards in the digital identity space; and, most of all, we solved one of the most challenging trust problems in the world: how to pre-clear passengers for immigration ahead of their arrival and get them across borders in seconds.</p>
<p>In delivering the world’s first implementation of a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) following ICAO standards, in Aruba in March 2023, we drew a map of the future. It’s a seamless world, where verifiable identity and data makes interacting with each other smoother, faster, and more secure — because we now have genuine confidence that identity and data can be trusted.</p>
<p>For airports and airlines and governments, that future is here, it’s happening right now; we’re implementing it. That is why our partnership with SITA is so exciting. It means global reach at the start of a new era. For travelers, it’s the end of rushing to wait. We’re freeing data to do what it can do when it’s trusted: Speed everything up, make everything simple.</p>
<p>But the technology we developed for the DTC is transformational for every industry, business operation, and service where identity and data need to be authenticated and trusted and where paper-based processes and traditional digital approaches are getting in the way of making things simple, efficient, and fast.</p>
<p>Because we’ve created the most powerful form of digital identity, that power can be used in so many innovative ways, big and small, to create better processes, products, and customer experiences. And because our solutions work on any system, we have an organic way to integrate identity and data across all sectors, creating spectacular new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Travel is leading the way —&nbsp;but we are delivering exciting use cases from agriculture to AI, education to finance that are not far behind. Innovation in one use case feeds innovation in another. Suddenly, a landscape of borders — not just geographic and national — but sector and vertical, can be easily crossed. The digital world created by the internet is open when you can authenticate and trust. This is what we’re doing. And we’re tremendously excited about this investment because it helps to accelerate our development roadmap to deliver these benefits to all.</p>
<p>Indicio has distinguished itself by making our customers’ ideas become a reality. Our team members are world-class visioneers. So watch this space as we accelerate — and drop us a line if you’d like us to make your vision for a smarter, smoother, safer world real too.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Heather Dahl</p>

To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF80 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier.

The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>In partnership with Mastercard Open Banking, with services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company, Fannie Mae continues to work toward improving access to affordable housing with secure banking-powered technologies, speeding up the application process for lenders and reducing the need for manual document preparation.</p>



<p>In addition to helping lenders validate assets and assess a borrower’s rent payment history and cash flow, <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-desktop-originator/asset-reports?utm_campaign=pte-sf-duenh-202403&amp;utm_source=vanity&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=awa-van-noa-len-o-n&amp;utm_term=len">Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service</a> gives lenders the power to verify a borrowers’ income and employment information using a single 12-month asset report. This digital enhancement is saving lenders time while enhancing the borrower experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Demand for a better mortgage process&nbsp; 



<p>Traditionally, borrowers have been asked to manually collect and share stacks of sensitive income documents with mortgage loan officers, a time-consuming and less secure process that creates inefficiency for both the borrower and the lender.&nbsp;</p>



 A complete digital verification solution for mortgage lenders&nbsp; 



<p>DU provides a digital option that simplifies and removes friction from the application process. When applying for a mortgage, borrowers can access Finicity’s user-friendly <a href="https://www.finicity.com/connect/">Connect</a> consent flow to link their bank accounts, enabling their data to be easily shared with the lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one report from Finicity, DU can help lenders validate a borrower’s asset, income and employment information while simultaneously analyzing cash flow and rent payment history to help approve more potential homeowners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the verifications needed to process a mortgage application can be conducted on the spot, without paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fannie Mae’s latest innovation leverages <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS) from Finicity as a leading report supplier to power the verifications needed to process a mortgage application. &nbsp;</p>



 
 Fannie Mae’s Digital Verification Solution requires an asset report of 12 months or more to run 



 Lenders must request that this feature be <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/form/single-source-activation">turned on</a> 
 



<blockquote><p>“With Desktop Underwriter® (DU®), lenders can now get even more benefits from using a single 12-month asset report. We continue to look for ways to help lenders streamline their validation processes and improve the borrower experience, and this latest enhancement helps them do just that.”&nbsp;</p>Peter Skarnulis, Fannie Mae Vice President, Business Account Management Solutions</blockquote>

When we inspire others to understand and value women's inclusion, we forge a better world.” Needless to say, Ping Identity is both thrilled and honored to inspire inclusivity among our coworkers, peers, and greater network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what inclusivity means to people at Ping, I spoke with several female team members to get their perspectives on contemporary gender issues. I’m grateful to these women for sharing their hard-won insights learned from working in the tech space.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In this episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude, alongside Hakan Yildiz from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Vladimir Simjanoski from <a href="https://www.blokverse.com/">Blokverse</a>, engage in an insightful examination of the intricate world of digital credential protocols, including Aries, OpenID4VC, ISO, and KERI. This episode is a treasure trove of insights on the future of digital identities, focusing on interoperability, privacy, and combating challenges like deepfakes.</p>
<p>The discussion begins by comparing digital credential exchange protocols and their applicability in varying contexts, from government-issued digital identities to private-sector applications. A highlight is the exploration of the architectural models—server-client vs. peer-to-peer—and their impact on the scalability and privacy of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Privacy considerations take center stage, especially concerning surveillance and data-sharing autonomy. The episode also tackles the critical issue of deepfakes, proposing enhanced content authenticity through digital credentials as a solution.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as a central theme, with a vision of wallets supporting multiple protocols to facilitate diverse interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers. This flexibility is seen as key to the widespread adoption of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Mathieu invites listeners to actively participate in shaping the future of digital credential protocols by joining the Trust over IP Foundation’s Credential Exchange Protocol Task Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of digital identities and the role of technology in securing and verifying digital credentials.</p>

<p>Startups build ad-hoc IAM systems, a tangled mess of spreadsheets, emails, and memory traces in the brains of the team members. As organizations grow, the tangles grow. Think about it:</p>
 
 When a new hire joins, how easy is it to get them productive? How long does it take until they’ve been given access to everything they need?&nbsp; 
 When it’s time for a compliance audit, do you need to sweat over spreadsheets, check multiple app interfaces, and comb through email chains, hoping you don’t miss something?&nbsp; 
 Is “Shadow IT” growing? When well-meaning employees start using convenient new apps, are they bypassing IT? Or does IT maintain visibility and control without bureaucracy?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Is offboarding easy? When someone leaves, can you quickly cut access to all the apps they used while retaining access to the data they created?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cheer up! Things will get worse.</p>
<p>As your company grows and your tech stack gets more complex, whatever chaos you had will get worse. Why?</p>
 
 You’re juggling multiple playbooks. One spreadsheet for onboarding, a checklist for audits, a half-remembered process for software requests. 
 Time becomes essential. Onboarding tasks, regular access reviews, or even handling forgotten password resets shouldn’t rely on your memory. 
 Your processes aren’t static. New apps get adopted, rules change, one-off issues reveal cracks in your workflows. Updating your playbooks becomes a time-consuming chore. 
 Your organization changes. New groups appear. Old groups merge. Consultants, temps, and suppliers need access 
 Collaboration is a nightmare. Chasing down other teams to get tasks done, sending reminders, consolidating responses, and hoping they update the results in the right place… it turns your attempted efficiency into another massive time suck. 
 
<p>The YeshID Difference: One Playbook, Total Control</p>
<p>Now imagine this:</p>
 
 Effortless orchestration: A new employee begins, and your centralized YeshID playbook spins into action. Accounts are created, exploiting the best available integrations. For anything without an integration, YeshID creates tasks with clear owners and deadlines. Task reminders? Automatically sent to the right department. You get progress reports, not a growing sense of dread. 
 Compliance is no sweat: Audit looming? YeshID pulls who has access to what and current settings across every supported app, then surveys users and managers to verify who truly needs what access. Reports become accurate and stress-free. 
 Offboarding without the panic: Employee departs, and your playbook cuts off access to integrated apps instantly. It also generates tasks with clear owners for everything else, ensuring no security holes slip through the cracks. 
 A playbook that evolves with you: YeshID is your adaptable IT brain. It leverages your IAM, automates manual steps, sends timely reminders, and handles approvals across teams. Change a process? Update the playbook, and everyone instantly follows the latest version. 
 
<p>Sound too good to be true? Let YeshID be your partner in keeping your identity and access management realm simple, effective, and secure. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get YeshID Onboard for free</a> and start today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Anonyome Labs team has headed to Washington, D.C., for the biggest credit union advocacy event of the year—the Governmental Affairs Conference, March 3–7, 2024!</p>



<p>If you’re attending the conference in D.C., we invite you to meet with us to learn how to streamline your operations, boost member satisfaction, and stop fraud with the revolutionary verification solution, reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Our sales team will be on hand to explain how reusable credentials are replacing inefficient and risky conventional Know Your Customer (KYC) methods with a frictionless system in which customers only have to verify themselves once.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials leverage ground-breaking decentralized identity and blockchain technology to create a cryptographically protected&nbsp;digital ID that is persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. The same credential ecosystem creates proof of identity for any customer interaction with the credit union.</p>



<p>While planning your visit to D.C. and all of the key sessions and events, why not schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team from Anonyome Labs, where we’ll show you exactly how reusable credentials can work for your institution and, as a bonus, give you access to our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.” This valuable tool will be a great resource to take back home to your credit union team for review.</p>



<p>We are excited to also share that on Day 4 of the conference (March 6), you can catch our team during an exclusive interview with Anonyome Labs’ VP of Sales, Matt Ure, on CU Broadcast Hosted by Mike Lawson.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be a sponsor of the first America’s Credit Unions GAC, the massive in-person and online event highlighting the meaningful work credit unions do to improve the financial well-being of their members and communities. This year’s program includes keynotes by former U.K. Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, and renowned actor-humanitarian Gary Sinise.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this important opportunity to advance the credit union industry with the latest innovations and offerings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find the team from Anonyome Labs in the industry hall of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center every day of the conference, March 3 to 7. Come say hi!</p>

<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> is the leader in proactive identity protection technologies. From verifiable credentials to VPNs and encrypted communications, we leverage our cryptography and blockchain technology expertise to take data privacy and security to the next level.

 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/bot-security-market">Future Market Insights</a>, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention 



 Programmatic Ad Fraud Detection 



 Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices. This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers (ATO), has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kasada.io/2023-state-of-bot-mitigation/">96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots</a>: Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 



 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/er-tv-may19-whiteops">digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion</a> and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 



 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, <a href="https://doubleverify.com/newsroom/ctv-ad-fraud-surges-with-a-69-increase-in-bot-fraud-in-2022-and-significant-growth-in-ctv-fraud-schemes">leading to inflated video ad impressions</a>. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/are-bots-winning-war-control-social-media">Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots</a>: This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/">57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022</a>: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies: Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened demand from publishers for accurate user metrics. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.</p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — February 21st to March&nbsp;4th <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Taiwan’s upcoming digital asset regulations, Russia’s FATF assessment, the US’s legislative push on crypto reporting, and the UK’s steps towards regulating stablecoins and staking services. Join us as we navigate these global shifts in the crypto regulatory landscape.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>Around the globe, countries are revisiting their regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies, marking a period of significant adaptation in response to the digital asset market’s expansion.</p><p>In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is preparing to present new digital asset regulations by September 2024, focusing on investor protection and market integrity. This move is part of Taiwan’s broader effort to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><p>Another major development over the last two weeks came from Russia, as its standing with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has shifted due to perceived gaps in crypto oversight. Reportedly, the FATF’s assessment points to the need for clearer guidelines and definitions within Russia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control digital financial transactions effectively.</p><p>In North America, the United States is witnessing legislative efforts aimed at refining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related services. Recent proposals challenge existing guidance on financial institutions’ reporting of crypto assets and seek to bolster the Secret Service’s capabilities in investigating crypto-related cybercrimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is advancing towards implementing cryptocurrency regulations, with a focus on stablecoins and staking services.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1761086134405255416?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These developments highlight a global trend towards recalibrating regulatory frameworks to better accommodate the unique aspects of digital assets. As countries grapple with the complexities of crypto regulation, the outcomes of these efforts will likely shape the future of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> Taiwan Sets September Deadline for Comprehensive Crypto Regulation <p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission is gearing up to introduce a draft of new digital asset regulations in September 2024, marking a significant step towards regulating the burgeoning digital asset market. The draft, as outlined by FSC Chairman Huang Tien-mu, aims to bolster market regulation and investor safety amidst concerns over the potential for fraud within the digital currency&nbsp;space.</p><p>The proposed legislation, including the Virtual Asset Management Bill introduced in October, seeks to enhance customer protection and industry oversight, imposing stiff penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Speaking of its possible impact on Taiwan’s crypto ecosystem, clearer regulations may attract more institutional investors, fostering a safer and more stable investment environment. On the downside, stringent measures and the potential for heavy fines could dampen innovation, especially among startups and smaller entities struggling with compliance costs.</p> US House Committee Challenges SEC&nbsp;Guidance <p>The US House Financial Services Committee has shown majority support to repeal the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which mandates financial institutions to list customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets. This guidance, criticized for potentially inflating balance sheets and hindering banks from engaging in digital asset custody, faces opposition for its implications on the sector’s operational dynamics.</p><p>Critics argue that SAB 121 limits traditional financial institutions’ participation in the burgeoning crypto market, especially in the context of the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, predominantly custodied by non-bank entities. On the flip side, proponents of the guidance advocate for its role in clarifying custody responsibilities amid the volatile crypto landscape.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>

<p>The Australian parliament is working on the government’s <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1404&amp;utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">Digital ID Bill 2023</a>. After passing the lower house, the Bill has been considered by a senate committee <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">inquiry</a>, which included hearing a day’s worth of expert testimony.&nbsp; The committee’s report has now been <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023/Report?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">tabled</a>.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the senate approve the Bill, but as usual, a number of opposition politicians wrote dissenting reports.</p>
<p>Two sorts of objections are worth correcting because they reflect serious misunderstandings of the Digital ID Bill and of the whole field of digital identity.</p>
 The Digital ID Bill has no new ID 
<p>The Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report at paragraph 1.16 alleges:</p>
<p>“It seems that [the government] has decided on a more syndicated model that centralises Digital ID in government hands, disregarding the Murray Review’s warnings. By departing from a truly federated approach to Digital ID, Labor is risking the integrity of the entire premise of such a framework.”</p>
<p>I will come back to the Murray Review shortly. For now, I only want to stress that the Digital ID Bill is not a “syndicated” model of digital identities. It is not any sort of model of digital identity.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill introduces no new IDs whatsoever. The whole point of the legislation is to conserve existing IDs and make them more reliable in digital form.</p>
 Federated identity has been tried and tried 
<p>The Coalition Senators are much attached to federated identity. They call out the 2014 <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/c2014-fsi-final-report">Murray Inquiry into the Financial System</a> which recommended a public-private federation of trusted digital identities. And they’re obviously proud of the public sector Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the dissenting report doesn’t mention the private sector trust framework effort.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the government worked on TDIF while the Australian Payments Council took on a parallel financial services trust framework called TrustID. After many years work, the TrustID working group was unable to reach consensus on use cases for banking digital identities, and the framework was quietly dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, more attention should be given to the impasse on TrustID use cases when digital identity is thought to be so urgent. That’s quite a paradox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that federated identity has been tried over and over in Australia, and in comparable economies, and it has <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-will-we-learn-from-the-market-failure-of-digital-identity/">proven to be a market failure</a>. Many commercial Identity Providers have launched in Australia but not one has built a sustainable business. As for TDIF, it’s solitary measure of success is the rush of identity service providers seeking accreditation in anticipation of business expected to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should listen to the market. The idea of free market federated identity provision, reusable across banking and government, has proven plainly not to be viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the government has heeded 15 years of experience of a stagnant digital identity market. With its fresh new Bill, the Australian&nbsp;government has progressed beyond the past idealism of reusable “digital identity”. The <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">Digital ID Bill doesn’t use the term anymore</a>, and instead focuses on digitising the many trusted IDs we already have, so they are more reliable online.</p>

   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has evolved since the 1980s and now requires two out of three options: something you have, are, or know. However, phishing poses a significant threat to MFA's security, emphasizing the need for better options. Biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators offer more secure alternatives. FIDO2 stands out as it includes phishing resistance in i

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been used by computer administrators since at least the 1980s. Regular people started using it in the mid-1990s when banking systems began to roll this out. It was pretty clunky; those key fobs were not small! And since I mentioned MFA as one road to greater security in my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">recent post</a> on passwordless technologies, I thought a quick refresher might be in order.</p>



 Today’s MFA 



<p>MFA looks much different than it did thirty years ago. MFA requires at least two out of these three options:</p>



 
 something you have 



 something you are 



 something you know 
 



<p>In practice, that has taken the form of everything from an SMS message to an iris scanner and more. As it turns out, not all MFA options have stood the test of time when it comes to better security. Depending on what you’re protecting, you might need to get more discerning when it comes to what techniques you use for MFA.</p>



 The Phishing Threat to MFA 



<p>Phishing is the biggest threat to MFA’s ability to solve all the world’s authentication problems. One definition of phishing is:</p>



<p>A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/phishing#">U.S. NIST Glossary</a>)</p>



<p>Phishing is when someone tricks you into clicking on a link that either takes you to or is part of a website that looks a LOT like a legit thing. It will likely pass your username and password on to the actual site and put up a page to collect the code received via SMS or email. At that point, the hacker (or, more to the point, their program) usually has 10-15 minutes to use the username, password, and code to get into the site and do things. Most likely, they’ll change your settings so the account has a different recovery email, a new phone number, and a new password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerks.</p>



 Better Options 



<p>So, what else is there if there are better ideas than an SMS message or, heavens forbid, an email? The answers fall into three categories: biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators. Which one you choose depends on the criticality assigned to what’s being protected.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometrics 



<p>Biometrics cover the “something you are” option of MFA. These can be anything from fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and voice recognition. This was a relatively reliable option, though <a href="https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/biometrics-and-privacy-issues-and-challenges/">accessibility issues</a> are a problem. However, with the age of AI and deep fakes dawning, not all biometric options are equally secure. According to <a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/can-deepfakes-beat-biometric-security/">Cybersecurity Magazine</a>, facial recognition is at the most risk, though voice recognition is not far behind. Fingerprints are better off, but not without their own challenges.</p>



<p>There are ways to make biometric recognition more robust. The evolution of attack and response, however, means attack mitigation is always a moving target.</p>



 App-based Authenticators 



<p>Another option that will fill the “something you have” option is an app-based authenticator. There are several out there, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">Google Authenticator</a>. Many of these apps use something called TOTP. This Time-based One Time Password functionality generates a number that changes, as you might guess from the name, over some (short) period of time. Several password managers (you <a href="https://security.georgetown.edu/csam-2020/benefits-of-password-managers/">use a password manager</a>, right?), like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, include a TOTP code, too. (I admit, I’m not sure about storing my password with my second factor, but that’s just me.)</p>



<p>If you are using a TOTP-based authenticator, then you need to be on top of getting that code out of the app and into the authentication screen. I often delay responding to the MFA challenge if it looks like my authenticator app only has under 10 seconds left for that number.</p>



 FIDO2-based MFA 



<p>Now for the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gold%20standard">gold standard</a> of authenticators: FIDO2! This MFA option puts <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa/">phishing resistance</a> as part of its core design. Go, team!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">FIDO Alliance</a> is the source of the FIDO2 family of specifications, including WebAuthn. FIDO2-compliant authenticators can use dedicated hardware tokens or mobile devices (like your phone). To use that token or the key stored on your mobile device, though, you need a biometric or a PIN. Combined with a traditional password step, this takes us from two-factor authentication (2FA) to multi-factor authentication.</p>



 Passkeys 



<p>If you read my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">last post</a> about passwordless authentication, you may be thinking that FIDO2-based MFA and passkeys sound similar. And, in fact, you would not be wrong! In many cases, you can just use a passkey and have 2FA, which is enough for many situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are not perfect; there are <a href="https://youtu.be/mxGczv1-XlE?si=YBrrRvPRcb-bVXM6">new threat models</a> that implementors need to consider before they roll out support for passkeys willy-nilly. However, they are still arguably better than passwords.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>I believe some form of MFA is better than none. That said, I also worry that it lulls people into a false sense of security. How risky is it for you personally if your account is hacked? How risky is it for your organization if your systems are compromised? What data will be exposed? If you don’t have time to understand those gory details, the only real option is to require a stronger form of MFA so you don’t have to worry about that. There are always plenty of other things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are an end-user, you may not have a choice of the quality of the MFA you get to use. In that case, something is better than nothing! If you work for a company with an IT department and the need for people to log in remotely (including your customers), then you really need to make MFA a priority. And when you do, make sure you do it properly with a phishing-resistant option.</p>

 Breaking Down Barriers: Integrated Wallets for Tokenized Securities 
 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Navigating the complexities of blockchain wallets has been a significant hurdle for traditional investors. The wallet barrier not only discourages investors from embracing digital securities but also presents compliance constraints, in some jurisdictions, for issuers who provide custodian wallet options.</p>
<p>To achieve critical mass, we must simplify the experience for end users by hiding these complexities. Integrated wallets are specifically designed to do that, especially the non-custodial ones.</p>
<p>What are integrated wallets?</p>
<p>Integrated wallets are digital wallets that are seamlessly embedded into a tokenization platform. It provides multiple benefits as listed below:</p>
 
 Hassle-free experience:&nbsp;Automatic creation of wallets, providing a seamless experience for non-blockchain investors. 
 Easy for traditional investors:&nbsp;Web banking-like transaction confirmation processes using passwords or biometric authentication. 
 All-in-one platform:&nbsp;No external navigation is needed, everything is integrated within the platform. 
 Flexible wallet support:&nbsp;Issuers can seamlessly support integrated custodial or non-custodial wallets, as we expand our integration with all wallet providers. 
 
<p>How does an integrated wallet work?</p>
<p>Onboarded investors effortlessly claim their automatically issued integrated wallet by creating a security key (e.g., biometric authentication) following simple instructions. Confirming operations and transactions becomes seamless through their security key (e.g., Touch ID).</p>

 The Future of Personal AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-personal-ai" title="Direct link to The Future of Personal AI">​</a> 
<p>For many years, artificial intelligence primarily piqued the interest of academic researchers and enthusiasts within niche technological sectors such as robotics. Although respected, AI presented little practical application for the average person. That changed in June 2020 with the debut of a Large Language Model (LLM) called GPT-3. GPT-3 inspired organizations and individuals to use AI to accelerate their workflows, from coding and blogging to planning itineraries. Today, the potential of AI is so immense that Simon Westh Henriksen, the CTO of Kin, believes personal AI will be one of the most valuable digital assets we own in the future. Simon and his team built Kin. They describe it as "your personal AI assistant for your private life." The intended persona for Kin is a mix between a life coach and a close friend.</p>
 My First Impressions of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#my-first-impressions-of-kin" title="Direct link to My First Impressions of Kin">​</a> 
<p>For the last three years, I've deemed ChatGPT my bestie, so when I heard about Kin, I immediately downloaded the beta on my phone. My initial impression was that there was a sense of familiarity because the user interface and interaction were reminiscent of other LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. However, there were some key differences between Kin and traditional chatbots – it focuses on privacy and personalization.</p>
 Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#privacy-first-artificial-intelligence" title="Direct link to Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence">​</a> 
<p>With traditional Generative AI Chatbots, your data lives on the company's servers for telemetry purposes (and more). In contrast, Simon explained that Kin doesn't have backend servers, and users' data stays exclusively with the user. This is possible because of Web5's <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a>. DWNs provide users with a local and personal data store. Now, you can ask an AI personal questions without worrying if someone else can also read it.</p>
 Personalized for You<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#personalized-for-you" title="Direct link to Personalized for You">​</a> 
<p>Unlike traditional Generative AI Chatbots, Kin retains the context of your conversations to provide personalized and relevant responses. As users engage with Kin, the platform analyzes these interactions to extract facts about the user, constructing a semantic memory. This process involves graphing and mapping details such as your name, relationships, interests, etc.</p>
<p>Simon explained the technological process behind this functionality: "It takes in this new knowledge that we have recognized from the chat, or what we think is new knowledge. And then we query this graph that already exists, and we kind of take a subgraph, the relevant subgraph, that might be related to that thing. Then we give it to the LLM, to the model, and it outputs graph operations. So that's something like add node, add edge, remove node, remove edge, and then we apply those to the graph. And in that way, the memory evolves as you speak and interact with Kin."</p>
 The Future of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-kin" title="Direct link to The Future of Kin">​</a> 
<p>The team at Kin is working on enhancing the platform's memory beyond facts of the user by introducing episodic memory. Episodic memory tracks events in users' lives and anchors them to a timeline to give AI an idea of how a user's life evolves.</p>

<p>Deepfake cyberattacks, phishing, and social engineering have all received a turbo boost in recent months due to the proliferation of easily accessed AI tools. Cybercriminals are some of the most creative individuals in the world. They spend their days conjuring up different ways to bypass security systems, not filling out spreadsheets and reports.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this article, we discuss how hackers are leveraging AI tools to bypass traditional identity security controls at an unprecedented pace, and just why generative AI attacks are so successful. We also look at how these attacks can be defeated using identity assurance controls that take a deterministic approach to securing identities, rather than relying on probabilistic methods that contain inherent levels of uncertainty. By implementing these modern controls, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of identity fraud for both their workforce as well as customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Generative AI Attacks  
<p>Hackers use out of the box as well as specifically trained large language models (LLMs), often created by nation state hackers (China, Russia, North Korea), to execute cyberattacks with frightening accuracy. Here are some of the attacks that get a significant boost from AI.</p> 
 Phishing  
<p>Prior to AI, we used to frequently delineate between “phishing” and “spear phishing,” where attacks were tailored to a specific individual. By using LLMs, hackers are now able to tailor just about every single phishing message to a specific target to get a much higher success rate. For decades now the industry has trained employees to spot telltale signs of phishing by looking for grammatical and spelling errors. Today, phishing messages created by LLMs are in the local language, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from the legitimate messages users get every single day. A <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">recent study</a> found a 1,265% rise in phishing, largely due to the usage of AI tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 Impersonation (Deepfake Cyberattacks)  
<p>Identity theft is at an all time high due to the ability of AI to impersonate an individual across all communication channels including voice, text and video. In recent weeks, a scammer used a series of<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/05/deepfake-video-conference-call/"> video deepfakes to extract more than $25M from an organization</a>. Hackers can create personas based on individuals in minutes, merely by looking at samples of their writing, publicly available videos, and social media posts. Just a few years ago, creating a deepfake video required significant resources. Today, freely available apps can do the job fairly well, with accuracy improving by leaps and bounds daily.&nbsp;</p> 
 Social Engineering&nbsp;  
<p>Before AI, social engineering attacks were highly manual in nature and oftentimes had low success rates. We’ve all received scam calls and many of us can easily spot them when the caller has no knowledge of our details and speaks with an unfamiliar accent. By using AI, hackers are able to create chatbots and voice conversation systems that mimic the tone, cadence, and contextual nuances of a specific target audience. LLMs also are able to use reinforcement learning so that they get better with every single conversation that occurs. These improved algorithms can then be used to target large numbers of users simultaneously, rather than being bottlenecked by human interactions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Generative AI Attacks Are Successful  
<p>Hackers love AI tools because they make them more efficient than ever. There are a few key reasons why AI-assisted attacks are seeing so much success today:&nbsp;</p> 
 Speed and Scalability  
<p>AI can process and analyze data and conversations at speeds that outpace any human by orders of magnitude. This ability enables these tools to launch widespread attacks in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adaptability  
<p>AI systems can adapt their strategies based on the responses from the target’s defenses. If users have been trained to look for specific red flags, these tools can adapt and respond accordingly within seconds. As a result, defense systems that rely on blocking known attack patterns are trivial for an AI attack to bypass quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
 Efficiency in Targeting  
<p>AI can analyze data from various sources to identify the most valuable targets to maximize its success. When AI identifies a series of patterns or signals, it can quickly train itself to focus on targets with the most likelihood for success. Most importantly, it can correlate with other AI systems who “soften the target,” to then outflank victim organizations' security controls. For example, one AI tool can target an organization with a DDOS attack and, when the victim is busy responding, another AI tool can execute a highly contextualized phishing campaign that references the DDOS attack to maximize its success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Leveraging Big Data  
<p>AI systems are able to integrate with countless data sources both public and private in order to maximize their impact. Attackers leveraging AI can refine strategies within seconds based on real-time events in ways never possible before. Social media, previous breach data available on the dark web, and leaked credentials can all be processed instantaneously to create new and more sophisticated attacks with a high likelihood of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Probabilistic Identity Security Controls Fail Against an AI Attack  
<p>The vast majority of identity security controls are failing today. To understand why this is the case, we have to understand the probabilistic nature of their implementations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probabilistic security controls operate on the basis of likelihood. They use various criteria to determine the probability that something is safe or a potential security threat. By contrast, deterministic security controls identify an outcome with a binary level of precision. They can determine with a high degree of certainty if something is true or false, safe or a threat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some of the primary methods the industry uses today to prove that someone is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishable Authentication Factors  
<p>Passwords, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one time passwords (OTP) </a>delivered via SMS or app, and push notifications are the primary methods organizations use to verify users today into their systems. AI creates significant accuracy in brute force password spraying attacks by being able to predict passwords. It also strengthens phishing and social engineering to trick users into providing OTP codes or accepting push notifications at a high rate. These controls are probabilistic as they cannot determine with certainty that the entity seeking access is the legitimate credential holder, and can be intercepted, replayed and phished.&nbsp;</p> 
 KBA-Based Identity Verification  
<p>AI systems’ ability to ingest massive amounts of data extremely quickly and in real time enables them to learn about their targets and easily answer questions such as their mother's maiden name and the street they grew up on. By combining this with phishing and social engineering capabilities, these AI-assisted hackers can quickly execute identity theft and gain access to employee and customer accounts. Knowledge-based security methods are also probabilistic by nature and can be easily intercepted, replayed, and phished from users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Human-Verified Documents  
<p>Many businesses have moved from KBA to online or in-person document verification in order to reduce identity fraud. However, attackers can use widely available AI tools to create fake documents such as passports and driver licenses that are able to trick most systems. The image below is a fake passport generated by AI that was able to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-fake-ids-pass-crypto-exchange-kyc-onlyfake">bypass the identity verification system of a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">404 Media</a></p> 
<p>Both human and machine-based verification controls of documents are probabilistic in nature because they have to account for differences in documents with regard to image quality and the sheer number of variations of the documents themselves. They can only determine the likelihood that a document is legitimate.</p> 
 Five Identity Controls to Defend Against AI Attacks  
 1. Focus on Deterministic Controls  
<p>In recent years, deterministic controls to secure identities have started to enter the market by way of open standards and innovative technology companies. Unlike most probabilistic controls, deterministic identity technology plays a crucial role in countering AI-assisted cyber attacks because they can provide a binary certainty; a definitive yes or no that eliminates the gaps exploited by AI-assisted attacks.</p> 
 2. Strong Authentication Protocols  
<p>Cryptographic Techniques: FIDO and similar protocols, such as the traditional smartcard, use public-key cryptography for authentication. During the registration process, the user’s device creates a new public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret on the device, while the public key is registered with the online service. Authentication involves proving possession of the private key without it ever leaving the user's device, making it extremely difficult for attackers (AI-assisted or not) to steal or replicate.</p> 
<p>Biometric Verification: FIDO, for example, supports local <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric verification</a> (like fingerprint sensors, facial recognition, etc.), which are difficult for AI to fake because the biometric data is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the device confirms the match and then uses cryptographic keys to authenticate the user to the service.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing Resistance</a>: FIDO authentication is bound to the original website's URL, making it resistant to phishing attacks. Even if AI is used to create highly convincing phishing sites, the authentication process checks the URL to ensure it matches the registered service’s URL, preventing the credentials from being used to authenticate a fraudulent site.</p> 
<p>Local Storage of Credentials: Since the cryptographic credentials in FIDO are stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the server or across the network, AI-assisted attacks that rely on intercepting or deducing credentials remotely are rendered ineffective.</p> 
 3. Layered IDV to Prevent Deepfake Cyber Attacks  
<p>Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated on a daily basis. While liveness detection is a positive step forward, it’s only a matter of time before it’s defeated by the rapid pace of innovation in AI. Multi-layered identity verification offers a deterministic way to prove people’s identities to defend against deepfake cyber attacks. Instead of relying purely on voice or video feeds, you combine a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 4. AI-Assisted Identity Risk Mitigation  
<p>While deterministic security controls are essential, they cannot fully protect against unknown and emerging threats. Modern probabilistic identity security controls take advantage of the same AI assistance as attackers. Real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls are a critical tool for organizations to manage evolving identity risks. By ingesting risk signals from a wide variety of sources, you can bring high fidelity to probabilistic controls.</p> 
 5. A Collaborative Identity Security Stack&nbsp;  
<p>It’s no secret that many identity security solutions tackle very specific challenges, operating in isolated spheres. Generative AI attacks find and exploit the gaps between these fragmented identity security processes. Open standards like FIDO and Open Policy Agent (OPA), were developed, in part, to ensure compatibility between security tools and processes. A more unified identity security approach, with solutions that communicate and collaborate across the identity lifecycle, greatly decreases the success rates of generative AI attacks.</p> 
 HYPR’s Anti-AI Strategy  
<p>HYPR was founded to put in place a deterministic way of proving that people are who they say they are. As a result, we were one of the first commercially successful implementations of the FIDO standards. Since then, our platform has expanded to prevent automation and scaling of identity-related attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines strong passwordless authentication, continuous risk mitigation and comprehensive identity verification so that you can be certain that a person is who they claim to be throughout the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>HYPR Authenticate is our category-leading <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> solution, which is built on top of the FIDO standards and fully eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication and verification processes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> is an identity fabric, which integrates&nbsp;real-time risk assessment and mitigation, leveraging high-fidelity risk signals from numerous sources, including external environments, endpoints and other cybersecurity products.</p> 
<p>HYPR Affirm, our comprehensive product for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a>, provides a deterministic way to prove that an identity is legitimate and belongs to the person asserting it. HYPR Affirm combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification, AI-powered chat, video, facial recognition and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

 UK Home Secretary Warns of Deepfake Threat to Upcoming General Election 



<p>UK Home Secretary James Cleverley has warned that deepfake videos created using artificial intelligence pose a significant threat to influence the upcoming general election. Cleverley, ahead of a meeting with tech leaders in Silicon Valley, expressed concerns that adversaries from Iran or Russia could flood social media platforms with realistic deepfake videos to sway voters. While Meta is setting up a team to tackle disinformation and AI abuse before the EU elections, there has been little commitment among the major social media players toward detecting and banning deep fake videos.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF78 rewards. DF79 runs Feb 29 — Mar 7,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 78 (DF78) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 22, 2024 and ended 12:01 am February 29. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF79 is live today, February 29. It concludes on March 7. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF81 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF79   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF79 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. In previous years, the Ocean core team built a core tech stack with broad applicability in AI x crypto. In 2023, we tested hypotheses towards growing traction. From that, the three brightest spots are Ocean Predictoor, Ocean Compute-to-Data (C2D), and Ocean Enterprise. For 2024, we focus on&nbsp;these.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Sections 2, 3, and 4 elaborate on goals for Predictoor, C2D, and Ocean Enterprise respectively. Section 5 covers ongoing work: Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. Goal: Accelerate Ocean Predictoor  2.1 Predictoor Background <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. The “earn $” part is key, because it fosters&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Predictoor involves two groups of&nbsp;people:</p>  Predictoors: data scientists who use AI models to predict what the price of ETH, BTC, etc will be 5 (or 60) minutes into the future. The scientists run bots that submit these predictions onto the chain every 5 minutes. Predictoors earn $ based on sales of the feeds, including sales from Ocean’s Data Farming incentives program.  Traders: run bots that input predictoors’ aggregated predictions, to use as alpha in trading. It’s another edge for making $ while&nbsp;trading.  <p>Predictoor is built using the Ocean stack. And, it runs on<a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/"> Oasis Sapphire</a>; we’ve <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/success-in-ai-powered-prediction-bots-leads-to-ocean-oasis-partnership-e4e9f697c99a?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">partnered</a> with the Oasis&nbsp;team.</p><p>Predictoor Traction. Predictoor has highly promising traction: starting from zero volume on mainnet launch in October 2023, volume has grown to &gt; $15M / day. [Source: <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=all">DappRadar</a>].</p><p>Predictoor is rocking! So we’re doubling down on it in&nbsp;2024.</p> 2.2 Predictoor Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>With this context in mind, here are Predictoor goals for 2024. We’ll work to get users making serious $, then we’ll scale&nbsp;up.</p><p>Goal 1: Users making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. We want both predictoors and traders making serious $. So, the key trick is for traders to make serious $; then they’ll spend $ to buy feeds; which leads to serious $ for predictoors. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Everything else&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Here are the sub-steps of goal&nbsp;1:</p>  1.1 Make $ trading: internal. Conduct experiments iteratively until we make $ trading in some combination of {trading venue &amp; pair, prediction strategy, trading strategy, other}. Results are highly promising, and getting better weekly. Simultaneously, build a first-class data pipeline and analytics dapp, to better answer the question “how much $ am I making” and drill-down questions. The dapp will start with predictoor bots, then expand to trading&nbsp;bots.  1.2 Make $ trading: external. Update Predictoor product so that community can follow the make $ strategy from (1). Eg add feeds, change prediction bot, change trading bot. If needed, have new smart contracts. Continually improve data pipeline and analytics dapp.  1.3 Make more $ predicting: external. Each feed is currently priced 1 OCEAN/day, which under-values the feed compared to $ being made by traders, and therefore means lost $ opportunity for predictoors. A better pricing approach will address this. We will explore possible approaches (e.g. auctions), and roll out the best one in the Predictoor product.  <p>At this point, the Predictoor product architecture enables predictoors and traders to make serious $ on any given feed, or combination of&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Goal 2: Scale up. Here are sub-steps:</p>  2.1 Reduce trading friction via TG bots &amp; more. Coming into this step, both predictoors and traders onboard via READMEs to run Python bots. For predictoors this is generally fine, since they need to change code to improve modeling or trading strategies if they want an edge. However for traders, we can make it easier to run bots with “good default” strategies. This in turn increases sales volume. Therefore the goal of this step is to make it easier for traders to run bots. A key strategy will be to leverage Telegram (TG)&nbsp;bots.  2.2 Grow # feeds in DeFi. Once predictoors and traders are making serious $, we will significantly expand the number of feeds within DeFi: more tokens, more exchanges, more time scales, signals beyond just close price, and more. E.g. from 20 to 20,000 feeds. This will increase the $ made by traders and by predictoors.  2.3 Grow to new verticals. As that starts to hit diminishing returns, we will expand beyond DeFi: weather, climate, energy, real estate, logistics, agriculture, food prices, gas prices, and more. One possible starting point is prediction weather prediction for a couple cities; then expand city by city; then to every square km on&nbsp;earth.  <p>Goal 1 is for “0→1” to get product-market fit, and goal 2 “1→n” for scale-up.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1732321049847456123">Stretch goal</a>: world model on ground-truth physics. We’ll train a single AI model across all feeds. This model will continually ingest the physics of the world to predict its next state. Truly a *world model*. We’ll also give it all the training data that current LLMs take. The net result: a model with vastly more data than current LLMs, and ground-truth physics in all that additional data. <a href="https://www.explainablestartup.com/2017/06/why-prediction-is-the-essence-of-intelligence.html">Prediction is intelligence</a>. This is Predictoor’s endgame.</p><p>It’s a big vision! Goals 1 and 2 alone will occupy us for all of 2024 and much of 2025. The stretch goal will&nbsp;follow.</p> 3. Goal: Launch C2D Springboard  3.1 Core Stack Background <p>At the core of the Ocean tech stack are <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/data-nfts-and-data-tokens/">datatokens</a> and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/compute-to-data/">Compute-to-Data (C2D)</a>. Datatokens enables token-gating of AI models, predictions, and more. They enable data wallets, data exchanges, and data DAOs. C2D is pragmatic and useful privacy approach, complementary to other privacy approaches.</p><p>C2D Details. Let’s drill into C2D&nbsp;further.</p>  Why C2D. Private data is valuable: using private data can improve research and business outcomes. But concerns over privacy and control make it hard to&nbsp;access.  What is C2D. Compute-to-Data (C2D) grants access to run compute against the data, on the same premises of the data. Only the results are visible to the consumer. The data never leaves the premises. Decentralized blockchain technology does the handshaking.  C2D Benefits. Ocean C2D enables people to sell private data while preserving privacy, as an opportunity for companies to monetize their data assets. C2D can also be used for data sharing in science or technology contexts, with lower liability risk, because the data doesn’t&nbsp;move.  Left: C2D Conceptual Flow. Right:&nbsp;C2D2!<p>Internal discussions. In Ocean core team, we’ve long understood the unique selling points of C2D. It’s why we built it in the first place, way back in 2019! Over the years, we’ve had continuous interest in using it, such as our collaboration with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a> (a part of Daimler). However, we saw that we hadn’t fully leveraged its potential, as we’d invested our time on other features.</p><p>Besides C2D, we’ve see many friction points in using the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Community feedback. Over the past several months, we interviewed community members for feedback, especially to gain insights on how to best enhance the core stack. Some feedback has already translated to completed actions such as improving <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean docs</a>. The two main themes from the community were: (a) clear demand to make C2D great, and (b) developer experience is still high friction.</p> 3.2 C2D &amp; Core Stack Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>The community feedback was consistent with our own discussions, and helped us to confirm what mattered. This in turn informs our plans for 2024. Thus, here are C2D / tech stack goals for 2024, culminating in a C2D springboard.</p><p>Goal 1. Unified backend. From community feedback we learned that deploying and maintaining the various Ocean components (Aquarius, Provider, Subgraph, C2D) is too complex. In 2024, we will simplify this process by merging all of them into a single, more manageable component. This upgrade means easier installation with just one command and a user-friendly admin dashboard, set for release in Q2 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 2. C2D.2. The current C2D, while powerful, has friction in creating and deploying algorithms. So we’re integrating C2D into the newly-unified backend to simplify its use. This means straightforward installation and maintenance, along with easier ways for users to write and deploy algorithms and ML models. This update will be launched in Q3 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 3. Build a “C2D springboard” to further empower our Ocean community. This platform will make it easy to showcase the capabilities of your AI algorithms for specific use cases, reminiscent of Ocean Market, but heavily tuned to C2D workflows. The product is set to launch in Q4 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As we roll out these updates, we’ll continue to leverage Ocean’s Data Challenges to catalyze development of AI algorithms for&nbsp;each.</p> 4. Goal: Roll Out Ocean Enterprise <p>Ever since the release of Ocean v4 (spring 2022), there has been growing interest in the businesses community about Ocean’s capabilities, especially Data NFTs, datatokens and Compute-to-Data (C2D).</p><p>Traditional businesses operate in highly regulated environments, where strict compliance to industry regulation such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://www.eu-data-act.com/">EU Data Act</a>, and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MiCA</a> have a major impact on operations and product development. Ensuring compliance can hinder innovative solutions from going into production.</p><p>Starting this year, a new endeavor called Ocean Enterprise will launch. It will help businesses take Ocean-powered solutions into production. Ocean Enterprise comprises both a group of collaborators and a tech&nbsp;stack.</p>  The collaborators are a diverse group of organizations spanning eight countries and seven industries. This group has already established the Ocean Enterprise Collective to gather requirements, design and develop a tech&nbsp;stack  The tech stack is an enterprise-ready, compliant version of Ocean. It will be based on the existing Ocean stack. It will incorporate additional new enterprise-specific features to allow businesses to securely collaborate, share and monetise their data in a fully compliant manner. The first release will be later this&nbsp;year.  <p>Work on the new Ocean Enterprise version began quietly several months ago. Stay tuned: more details will be announced in the following months&nbsp;👀.</p> 5. Ongoing <p>In addition to the core initiatives above, we will continue with ongoing efforts in Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. This section elaborates.</p> 5.1 Data Challenges <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Ocean Data Challenges</a> are competitions for data scientists to build predictive models, do analytics, or otherwise.</p><p>We’ve been running them since 2022. We will continue them in 2024, though as mentioned above, now tuned towards&nbsp;C2D.</p> 5.2 Data Farming&nbsp;(DF) <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF</a> is Ocean’s incentives program. Typical APYs are&nbsp;5–20%.</p><p>DF currently emits 150,000 OCEAN weekly rewards. As the schedule outlines, rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-March 2024, and double again to 600,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-September 2004.</p>  50% of weekly DF rewards are for Passive DF, i.e. locking&nbsp;OCEAN.  The other 50% for Active DF, where users have to engage more actively for rewards, such as running prediction bots.  <p>As with previous years, for 2024, Passive DF will remain unchanged, and the specific activities within Active DF may&nbsp;evolve.</p> 5.3 Ecosystem support <p>Ocean has a lively<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem"> ecosystem</a> of dapps grown over years, built by enthusiastic developers. The Ocean ecosystem also contains many data scientists and OCEAN holders who do predictions, data challenges, Data Farming, and more. Furthermore, Ocean has an excellent<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/community"> community of ambassadors</a>.</p><p>For 2024, the core team will continue to support the Ocean ecosystem &amp; Ocean Ambassadors.</p>Some <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem/">featured dapps</a> from Ocean’s ecosystem. 6. Conclusion <p>In 2024, we will double down on Predictoor’s exponential growth, launch a “C2D springboard”, and roll out Ocean Enterprise. We will continue to run Ocean Data Challenges, Data Farming, and support our lively ecosystem.</p><p>This product update stands for our roadmap to making Ocean Protocol more accessible, efficient and powerful — all in the name in traction.</p> Notes <p>[1] This step only comes now, because we first needed to establish an architecture where both predictoors and traders can conceptually make serious $. If we did this UX work earlier, we’d have spend time optimizing a UX that any step of goal 1 might have become obsolete.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Fission has been working with the IPFS ecosystem since we started. Content addressing is a fundamentally useful innovation that opens new use cases and approaches that are difficult or impossible without.</p><p>This year, the community and the organizations involved are changing in significant ways. Protocol Labs is nucleating a number of the engineering, open source, and operational teams into separate startups, engineering collectives, and foundations.</p><p>For IPFS projects and tooling, we must re-evaluate how we work together from code to commons.</p> What is IPFS Mainnet? <p>Mainnet is a term used to describe the default or "main" network that default settings connect to. This has mostly been "assumed" for the IPFS network, and not really highlighted for anyone other than protocol experts. The technical name for Mainnet is Amino, and there's a <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/">blog post from September 2023</a> that goes into some more details and changes happening.</p><p>Diving deeper into Mainnet, there are a variety of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/">public utilities that are described in more detail in the IPFS docs</a>. One of the most notable is the IPFS.io public gateway, that serve up content-addressed data through an HTTP gateway that every browser can access.</p><p>This was run by Protocol Labs, and will now be a responsibility of the emerging IPFS Foundation, who in turn are relying on the new <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/">IP Shipyard organization</a> to do the technical work to host and maintain the gateway.</p><p>There are a number of other <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS Mainnet gateways</a>, including the gateway we've been running at Fission for many years:</p>While Fission's gateway is listed, we only serve up content that is synched to our servers by published apps and WNFS file systems<p>You'll note from the list that there are a number of commercial providers of IPFS services, like Cloudflare, Pinata, and Web3 Storage. As well as their "public" gateways, many of these organizations also sell services hosting dedicated gateways.</p><p>The way that IPFS works, all the nodes / gateways / desktops etc connect together and store pieces of data, "addressed" by the data itself. Unlike with a single web server being down and no one else having the "authority" to have the data at a location like <code>example.com/somedata.pdf</code>, IPFS nodes ask each other for all of the blocks that make up a content address, and the receiver can then verify that the data is correct.</p><p>IPFS Mainnet is the giant global network that uses the default bootstrap list, the default Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that helps locate content on the network, and all of the public and dedicated gateways that connect to it.</p> Alternate Networks <p>Using a different list of bootstrap nodes and other configuration settings, you can choose to not connect to IPFS Mainnet. Here are two examples of projects that made this choice:</p><p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> uses IPFS to synch and serve data across their ecosystem – we had them on for a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-tech-talks-sourcery-with-decentralized-databases/">Fission Tech Talk</a> a while back – but doesn't connect to Mainnet by default.</p><p><a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a> is a chat app that uses IPFS to synch and connect devices, but on a network that is private to the connected devices.</p><p>Performance, privacy, or other considerations are all reasons that you might not want to use Mainnet, while still relying on the same codebases and technology stack.</p> Everywhere Computer and IPFS <p>Fission's primary product is the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. This is the platform we're building on top of the open protocol InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM) that we developed alongside a number of collaborators in the UCAN and IPVM working groups.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer lets you run compute everywhere. This is accomplished by supporting WebAssembly functions that are published to IPFS, and by fetching and storing data that needs to be computed to and from IPFS. Separately, we use libp2p, the peer-to-peer networking layer that IPFS also runs on, to connect all of the compute providers, and to share receipts of results and other data across the network.</p><p>Simplistically, you could say IPVM and the Everywhere Computer add compute to IPFS.</p><p>Note that we didn't say "IPFS Mainnet" there. We heavily use content addressing in the design of the system, so that we can do things like cache functions on compute nodes, cache results across the network to skip computation all together, and many of the other optimizations you can do from edge devices to servers when you're using content addressing rather than location addressing.</p><p>The design of the Everywhere Computer will introduce the concept of Subnets. These will be default settings, permissions, optimized functions, and other configuration options that let anyone compose groups of computers to support different ecosystems and applications.</p><p>However, our default public beta subnet (cool name and logo forthcoming!) will connect to IPFS Mainnet. The public commons that the IPFS Mainnet represents is something that we've always been excited about and supported, and we're excited to add content-addressed compute with the Everywhere Computer.</p>You can watch a demo and overview of the Everywhere Computer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6n2dhjmYes&amp;t=10s">from our late Feb 2024 presentation</a><p>Across both public gateways and commercial providers, developers will be able to fetch data, run it through an IPVM compatible function, and then store the results back on IPFS Mainnet.</p><p><a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up for the Everywhere Computer beta</a> if you'd like to be involved.</p> Gathering the Commons <p>Along with IP Shipyard, we're hosting an event today in Denver to share the news about IPFS Mainnet support, and start gathering the commons of people and organizations that are interested in supporting and improving this public global network.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about IPFS as Commons:</p><p>As an ecosystem, app or project that relies on the IPFS technology stack (whether it connects to Mainnet or you run a private network), what do you need and how do you want to provide support in return?</p><p>As a commercial provider, let's talk about inter-connecting our nodes and jointly running a more efficient network. If you rely on Kubo, go-libp2p, js-libp2p that are maintained by the IP Shipyard team, or other open source code bases, how do you plan on supporting them? What features and functions would you want to prioritize and fund, or contribute engineering resources to help implement?</p><p>As an individual using IPFS from your desktop or through various apps, how do you want such an open network to function, and what should it prioritize?</p><p>There are a number of legal challenges, takedown requests, and content moderation topics that come up across public gateways. Should IPFS Mainnet supporters join forces to decide on how to handle some of these concerns across the commons network?</p><blockquote>This year, the IPFS and extended ecosystem is graduating to a more commons based approached, with many separate companies, foundations, and funding partners.<br><br>At ETH Denver we want to introduce the changes, and invite people to take part in supporting and governing large public commons projects like the <a href="http://ipfs.io/">ipfs.io</a> public gateway, and the Kubo IPFS node codebase.<br>​<br>We will have a presentation by Adin Schmahmann from IP Shipyard, IPFS Core Maintainer, to introduce <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/new-chapter">IP Shipyard’s New Chapter</a> and other existing and upcoming initiatives.<br><br>We will follow with a discussion of IPFS as Commons, welcoming IPFS operators, dapp builders, blockchain ecosystems, and others interested in the future of the IPFS commons. This will be a facilitated discussion and Q&amp;A, hosted by Boris Mann, Founder of Fission.</blockquote><p>If you're in Denver, you've still got time to join us for the <a href="https://lu.ma/6suk3oa5">IPFS Mainnet event today, Wed Feb 28th, 4pm MST</a>, otherwise we'll be sharing presentation slides and other follow up notes <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/ipfs-mainnet-at-ethdenver/17620">on the IPFS Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

<p>According to the most recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are seeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. This puts credit unions between a rock and a hard place: friction vs security.</p>



<p>Quick catch-up: Traditional KYC methods often lead to tedious, friction-filled processes such as:</p>



 
 Manual processing 



 Relying on third parties 



 Physical branch visits 



 Delays in account access 



 The list can go on and on. 
 



<p>But this process is now obsolete thanks to reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Why it matters: With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once. By applying cutting-edge technology, reusable credentials not only take friction out of your operations, but makes every touch point more secure than ever before.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can revolutionize credit union operations in our new eBook, “KYC: A New Age of Less Fraud and Friction”.</a></p>



<p>The big picture: Say goodbye to “What is your mother’s maiden name?” With reusable credentials, credit unions will revolutionize their operations and create an incredible member experience with seamless interactions in every channel.</p>



 Dive deeper 







<p>Beyond credit union KYC: the ongoing friction struggle</p>



<p>Friction is an ongoing challenge for credit unions at every touch point. There can be different login or verification experiences at every channel.</p>



<p>The core issue that causes most of the friction in your operations is the temporary nature of current credit union KYC and identity verification. While the initial KYC process validates a member’s identity for account opening, this verification is a one-time use and cannot be reused. For members to have day-to-day interactions with their credit union they’ll have to repeatedly verify their identity. Not to mention that the current methods can be reproduced by bad actors.</p>



<p>Security questions can be easily guessed through social engineering, tellers may struggle to differentiate between fake and real IDs, and SMS-based verifications are often indistinguishable from phishing.</p>



<p>The current credit union KYC process not only causes delays in member service and satisfaction but also burdens employees in the fight against fraud, potentially leading to financial losses.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Give your members the experience of “pre-check”</p>



<p>Drawing inspiration from the success of TSA Pre-check&nbsp; in travel, Anonyome Labs’ solution introduces credentials that are persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. By applying this concept to credit unions, the result is an elevated member experience where KYC becomes a persistent validation process.</p>



<p>&nbsp;With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once, ensuring seamless and secure interactions from account sign-up to every subsequent touchpoint. This innovative technology eliminates the need for repetitive verifications, reducing friction in member interactions, and enhancing overall security. (All without disrupting existing solutions, processes, or member experiences.)</p>



<p></p>



<p>Tellers can focus on member experience instead of fake IDs</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PYMNTS-FIs-Revamping-Technologies-to-Fight-Financial-Crimes-December-2023.pdf">30% of financial institutions</a> plan on taking feedback from their employees or their customers’ needs when selecting solutions partners.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will transform your member and employee experience. Employees, especially those in critical roles such as call centers and tellers, will be empowered to be more effective&nbsp;for the overall security and satisfaction of credit union members.</p>



<p>Tellers and employees often&nbsp; bear the responsibility of verifying member identities, a task full of pressure and potential security risks. With reusable credentials, the burden is significantly lifted, as the need for repetitive verifications.</p>



<p>Call center employees can shift their focus from identity validation to enhancing the member experience, fostering quicker response times and more efficient interactions. Similarly, tellers are no longer in high-stress situations like having to distinguish between genuine and forged IDs.</p>



<p>Providing usable credentials cultivates a positive atmosphere for both employees and credit union members.</p>







<p>Credit union KYC innovation is easy</p>



<p>Credit unions are losing members due to a lack of innovation. A <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/credit-union-innovation-real-time-payments-fintechs/">PYMNTS Intelligence</a> research study found:</p>



 
 27% of credit union members say they would consider changing financial institutions (FIs) to access new products or more innovative solutions. 



 This willingness to switch has increased to 27%, up from 17% since 2018. 



 The share of CU members willing to switch to more innovative solutions is very close to the number of non-CU members willing to do the same, 29%. 
 



<p>Between member’s preferences and the continual increase in fraud, it is vital for credit unions to implement new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with a technology provider, like Anonyome Labs, makes adding cutting-edge technology to your existing operations not only doable, but seamless. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Our technology</a> includes everything you need to build reusable credentials into your existing apps and systems. No need to rip and replace what’s been working for years.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable credentials and decentralized identity&nbsp; 



How do reusable credentials work?&nbsp;




<p>1. Initial identity verification: When a member joins a credit union or starts an account, a decentralized identity (DI) system verifies their identity using robust authentication methods.<br></p>







<p>2. Creation of reusable credentials: Once the member’s identity is verified, the DI system generates reusable credentials. These credentials are encrypted – making them tamper-proof and secure.<br></p>







<p>3. Ownership and control: Unlike traditional identity systems where organizations manage and store user data, decentralized identity gives ownership and control to the individual. For credit unions, this means the member owns their credentials and they are stored securely on their device, including the ability to store and present credentials from within your app and interfaces.<br></p>







<p>4. Verification at touchpoints: For every interaction with the credit union, whether it’s logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, the member can present their reusable credentials. These credentials serve as irrefutable proof of their identity without the need for repetitive verification processes.</p>



 




How can reusable credentials help credit unions?




 
 Enhanced security: Reusable credentials enhance security by reducing the reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud. For example, traditional security measures, such as security questions that can be exploited through social engineering or SMS-based verifications that are susceptible to phishing, are replaced by reusable credentials.<br> 
 







 
 Frictionless member experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for credit union members. Once verified, members enjoy a continuous and secure interaction across various touchpoints without the need for repeated identity checks.<br> 
 







 
 Privacy protection: Since members control their reusable credentials, they have the flexibility to share only the necessary information at each interaction. This is a privacy-centered approach that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.  
 



<p>Reusable credentials redefine the way identity is managed, placing control in the hands of members and ensuring a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused experience across various credit union touchpoints.&nbsp;</p>

What is decentralized identity?




<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>A decentralized identity looks like this:</p>



 
 Reusable credentials: Identity credentials, once verified, can become reusable and portable across various services and applications. Users can present their credentials without the need for repeated identity verification, streamlining interactions and reducing friction.<br> 



 Tamper-proof technology: Decentralized identity uses technology, such as blockchain, to record and verify identity information. This technology ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.<br> 



 Secure communication: By its very nature, decentralized identity provides perpetual, irrefutable, and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure and immediate authentication and identity validation. <br> 



 Reduced identity fraud: By giving individuals control over their identity and leveraging advanced security technology, DI can drastically reduce the risk of identity fraud.<br> 



 Privacy by design: Privacy is a fundamental principle of DI. Users have control over what information they share. This approach contrasts with centralized systems where users often give over control of their data.<br> 



 User control: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, decentralized identity empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>Decentralized identity has the power to reshape how individuals interact with digital services, ensuring greater privacy, security, and user control over their identity. As the technology continues to evolve, DI solutions are becoming increasingly relevant across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/">Dr. Paul Ashley,</a> who’s spent over 25 years in the privacy and security space, says this about DI: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view.”</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains decentralized identity to get the full picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 




How can reusable credentials prevent fraud?
 
 Cryptographic security: Reusable credentials use advanced tech (cryptography) to secure information. This makes credentials tamper-proof which reduces the risk of fraudsters attempting to manipulate or replicate identity information.<br> 



 Irrefutable proof of identity: Once a user’s identity is verified and made into a reusable credential, it is irrefutable proof of their identity. Traditional methods, such as security questions or SMS verifications, are more susceptible to social engineering or phishing.&nbsp;<br> 



 Reduced weak security points: Traditional KYC methods often include the exchange of sensitive information, creating potential attack points for fraudsters. Reusable credentials limit the places where fraudulent activities can occur.<br> 



 Decentralized ownership: With decentralized identity, users own and control their reusable credentials. This decentralization minimizes the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there’s no single data center storing a vast amount of sensitive user information. 
 



 




How can reusable credentials decrease friction?
 
 Seamless interactions: Reusable credentials streamline user interactions across various touchpoints, eliminating the need for repetitive identity verification. Once a user’s identity is verified and a reusable credential is established, subsequent interactions, whether online, in-app, or in-person, become seamless. This reduces friction and enhances the overall member experience.<br> 



 Single verification point: With reusable credentials, the need for repeated identity checks is gone. Users can verify their identity once, and the credentials can be used at different touchpoints without the necessity for additional verifications.<br> 



 Privacy and consent control: Users have control over what information is shared with service providers. They can selectively disclose only the necessary information for a particular interaction. This privacy-centric approach minimizes the amount of data exchanged, contributing to a smoother, more privacy-respecting user experience. 
 



 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance. Here are some examples:</p>



 
 Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, reusable credentials can play a vital role in securely managing patient identities, medical records, and access permissions. Patients could have portable credentials for verifying their identity during medical visits, and healthcare providers can access relevant information securely.<br> 



 Government services: Governments are exploring DI and reusable credentials for services such as issuing digital IDs, driver’s licenses, and other official documents. This approach can enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and provide citizens with more control over their personal information.<br> 



 Education: In the education sector, reusable credentials can be used for academic certifications and transcripts. Students could have a secure and portable credential that verifies their education, which they can present to employers or other educational institutions.<br> 



 Farming and mining: Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. Reusable credentials can be used in these two industries when submitting reports to government agencies or receiving certifications – even across wildly disparate certifying bodies and reporting organizations.<br> 



 Supply chain and logistics: Reusable credentials can be applied in supply chain and logistics for secure tracking of products and verifying the authenticity of goods. This can help prevent counterfeiting and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.<br> 



 Travel and hospitality: The travel industry is exploring the use of reusable credentials for seamless and secure identity verification at airports, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. This could simplify the check-in process and enhance the overall travel experience.<br> 



 Retail and e-commerce: Reusable credentials can enhance the security of online transactions in retail and e-commerce by providing users with a secure and portable identity for authentication. This can help reduce fraud in online purchases.<br> 



 Human resources and employment: For employment-related processes, reusable credentials can be used for verifiable employment history, certifications, and qualifications and even background checks. This can streamline the hiring process and provide employers with confidence in the candidate’s credentials. 
 




<p></p>



<p>Reusable credential technology is promising; widespread adoption across industries is still evolving. Various pilot programs, initiatives, and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving identity-related challenges, improving security, and better user experiences across industries.</p>

 Crisis and/of&nbsp;Property <p>The concept of property is deeply embedded in our modern socio-economic systems. So much so, that it is often viewed as sacrosanct, a near-natural law-like means to distribute agency, power, and freedom, breaking away from the dominance of the few and old empires. Yet, property has simultaneously been part of a pathway of dispossession, violence, environmental degradation and the exclusion of vast and growing numbers of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Where property seemed immutable, the ground is shifting, for better or worse. Property has been an information processing and structuring mechanism through which we have governed our world by means of abstraction, simplification, and dominion over. Faced with today’s unprecedented complexity and entanglement of risks, externalities, and value creation, this theory of governance is falling&nbsp;short.</p><p>Indeed, the very paradigms underpinning our property institutions have become unavailable to think with, technically, materially and ethically:</p>  Objectification: The existing paradigm of objectification of land, nature, labor and information has obscured intrinsic interdependence  Extraction: The detachment of property rights from embodied responsibilities of stewardship had caused systemic negative externalities  Centralization: The optimization of abstract, exclusive rights has led to growing concentration of means of production and the benefits derived from&nbsp;them  Control: Top-down regulatory practices have failed to manage complex conceptual systems of value creation and extraction, and their externalities and&nbsp;impacts  <p>Interestingly, the structural failure of existing property systems to respond adequately to many of our critical contemporary challenges — be it the housing crisis, COVID-19, or Generative AI — is opening up windows of opportunity for large-scale transformation.

How might we move beyond control-oriented mechanisms towards ennobling systems, leveraging distributed protocols to recognize complexity and respond to contextual needs and&nbsp;nuance?  How might we move from commoning externalities towards outcome-based governance and long-term guardianship?  How might we move beyond centralization towards distributed and peer-to-peer permissioning, verification and accountability systems?  How might we braid alternative paradigms such as Indigenous governance and rights-of-nature with property institutions?  How might we create the enabling infrastructures that allow for alternative property mechanisms to be financed and adopted at&nbsp;scale?

Before: One-Sided Predictions <p>In a given epoch, a predictoor bot would predict a direction (“up” or “down”), and stake on that prediction (e.g. 10 OCEAN if not confident, 1000 if highly confident). Call it “one-sided predictions”. The image below illustrates.</p>Prior to v0.3, prediction bots would only submit an “up” OR a “down” prediction, i.e. “one-sided prediction”.<p>The problem is: accuracy in up/down predictions is typically 50.5% to 60% max. With such accuracies, a bot is never very confident in its up vs down prediction. It can nonetheless make $ doing these predictions, but is there a better&nbsp;way?</p><p>Furthermore, if a bot gets it wrong, they are slashed the full stake amount. So there is high variance in winnings from epoch to epoch: big win or big loss. High variance hurts profitability.</p><p>Towards a better way, here’s some brief&nbsp;theory.</p>  When a bot makes a prediction, its underlying model is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli probability distribution</a> [1]. That is, there are exactly two possible outcomes, a single trial, and the bot’s model has estimated the probability of each&nbsp;outcome.  However, in the status quo code, the bot only expresses one side of the model— the most probable side — in the course of submitting a prediction. It’s leaving information on the table, and exposing itself to high variance.   2. New: Two-Sided Predictions <p>The idea of two-sided predictions is to let the bot express both sides of the distribution in the course of submitting a prediction.</p><p>For example, if the predictoor bot calculates a probability of up=60%, and therefore down=40%, and has 1000 OCEAN to stake, then the bot stake 0.60*1000 = 600 OCEAN to “up”, and 100 OCEAN to down. Therefore the bot is always on both the winning side and the losing side, pro-rata to its prediction confidence. The image below illustrates.</p>As of pdr-backend v0.3, prediction bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.<p>The winning side will be there to catch the slashed stakes of the losing side, which in turn greatly reduces epoch-to-epoch variance.</p><p>Updated AI model. Before, the prediction bots a regression model to predict a next value of BTC etc. Now, it’s explicitly a classifier model, classifying up vs. down. pdr-backend currently has two linear classifiers: LinearLogistic and LinearSVC [2]. The classifiers give probability estimates.</p><p>How it’s implemented. In a given epoch, a predictoor bots does two transactions to the blockchain. It needs two accounts / private keys, because the Predictoor contracts allow only one tx per epoch per&nbsp;account.</p><p>How to run two-sided prediction bots. First, you need to set a second account, with envvar PRIVATE_KEY2.</p> export PRIVATE_KEY=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 1&gt;<br>export PRIVATE_KEY2=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 2&gt; <p>Second, be sure to have ROSE and OCEAN, to pay for gas fees and stake respectively.</p><p>Related minor&nbsp;changes:</p>  The model-based predictoor bot used to be approach 3. Now it’s approach 2. Approach 3 is deprecated.  Approach 1 used to randomly pick an up-vs-down prediction. Now it puts 50% stake into “up” and 50% stake into “down” (50–50). Therefore it needs two keys&nbsp;too.   3. Upgrades to Simulator <p>The prediction/trading simulator pdr sim got upgraded.</p><p>First, the simulator’s bots got upgraded.</p>  Sim prediction bots are now two-sided, behaving just like in the main predictoor bots. Therefore you can do rapid “what-if” experiments in simulation, before proceeding to run a predictoor bot for real&nbsp;$.  Sim trading bots are now confidence-based. Before, the trading bot would always buy OCEAN according to a fixed amount of USD if there was an “up” prediction; and did nothing on a “down” prediction. Now, in an “up” prediction it buys, in a “down” prediction it sells, both proportional to the model’s confidence in up vs&nbsp;down.  <p>Second, the simulator’s plots got a big upgrade. There are now realtime plots of: predictoor profit vs time, trader profit vs time, model accuracy vs time, predictoor profit distribution, trader profit distribution, and a contour plot to show the model’s probability response surface. The appendix shows these in detail. Or, run for yourself with pdr sim my_ppss.yaml. Expect simulator plots to continue to evolve&nbsp;😎.</p>The updated “pdr sim” realtime plot, having many sub-plots. The appendix zooms in on&nbsp;each. 4. Other v0.3 Improvements <p>From <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3.0 release notes</a>, here’s a thorough list of&nbsp;changes.</p>  Predictoor bots: Two-sided prediction. Easy deployment of &gt;1 agents via Kubernetes + CLI; pm2 deprecated.  Trader bots: live-mocking ability, enabling “ghost”&nbsp;trades.  Simulator: predictions are two-sided. Trades use model confidence. New plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response surface. Live trading possible.  Data pipeline: better structure, with DuckDB at the core. Analytics are starting to get built on&nbsp;top.  UX: There is now proper Python-style logging. ppss.yaml tuned. Small CLI utilities added.  Core: The codebase is more robust, including greatly-expanded type-checking and several bug fixes. Predictoor and trader agents are refactored to be simpler. Technical debt is low — no small&nbsp;feat.   5. Conclusion <p>As of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3</a>, predictoor bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”. This reduces epoch-to-epoch variance and increases profitability.</p><p>Also, the simulator got upgraded: predictions are two-sided, the trader bot uses model confidence, and there are new plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The v0.3 release has many other improvements: in trader bots, data pipeline, UX, and core bug&nbsp;fixes.</p><p>Try for yourself at pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot&nbsp;README</a>.</p> 6. Appendix: Simulator Plots&nbsp;Details <p>This section gives plots from an example simulation run.</p><p>Settings. It was predicting BTC/USDT on Binance, on 5m epochs. The predictoor bot LinearLogistic model, using the most recent value of BTC and of ETH, staking 100 OCEAN per epoch. The trader used up to 1000 USD per epoch. Simulation ran for about 2000 epochs (1 week). The YAML file given below lists all parameters.</p><p>Below is predictoor profit vs. epoch. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted 915&nbsp;OCEAN.</p>Predictoor profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below is trader profit vs. time. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted $2613.19&nbsp;USD.</p>Trader profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below left is model accuracy vs time, where accuracy is the % time it was correct in predicting up vs. down. Green is the estimated value, and the grey shadow is the 95% [lower bound, upper bound] <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint.html">confidence intervals according to a Binomial distribution</a>.</p><p>Below middle and right are predictoor and trader profit distributions as 1d scatterplots, respectively.</p>Left: model accuracy vs time. Middle: predictoor profit distribution. Right: trader profit distribution.<p>Below is a contour plot to visualize the model probability response surface. We can have a contour plot because this run has only two input variables: most recent value of ETH (y-axis), and most recent value of BTC (x-axis).</p>  The model predicts a direction of “down” for any (x,y)=(prev ETH, prev BTC) in the red region. The model predicts a direction of “up” for any (x,y) in the blue&nbsp;region.  The decision boundary is white. The contours towards the white are lower confidence; contours moving farther from white are higher confidence.  The red and blue points are training data for “went down” and “went up” respectively. Being encircled by yellow means that the model mis-classified on the training data; this is not surprising because we should not expect these two input variables to fully capture the response.

To celebrate this milestone, we’re taking a moment to look back at the incredible path we’ve traveled together this first year, filled with achievements, challenges, and&nbsp;growth.</p> Early Beginnings <p>From the get-go, our Ambassador Program was joined by more than 9o active Apprentices, all eager to support our mission. Your energy and commitment, dear Chameleons, were infectious, and quickly led to 16 of the most outstanding performers stepping up as Ambassadors by March.

<p>This month Google and Yahoo introduced crucial changes to their email delivery requirements. For senders targeting individual Gmail accounts, particularly those exceeding 5,000 emails daily, Google mandates authentication measures. While Yahoo does not state a minimum sending requirement, it will align with Google’s criteria.</p>
<p>Requirements that are to be enforced:</p>
 
 Implementation of both SPF + DKIM 
 Sending with an aligned “From” domain in either the SPF or DKIM domains 
 Sending from a domain with a DMARC policy of at least p=none 
 Using a TLS connection for transmitting email 
 Valid forward and reverse DNS (FCrDNS) 
 One-click unsubscribe (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058">RFC 8058</a>) 
 Low spam reported rate 
 
<p>Full requirements can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">Google’s help article</a>.</p>
<p>What are the implications of non-compliance with Google and Yahoo’s email standards?</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the new email standards set by Google and Yahoo could mean non-delivery to Gmail and Yahoo inboxes, affecting businesses relying on email communication.</p>
<p>These new requirements aim to fortify email security globally, emphasizing industry-acknowledged best practices. Safeguarding business reputation from phishing attacks is one of the top benefits of these changes. DMARC, now a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/">steadfast requirement</a>, blocks domain impersonation, providing control over email identity. Google emphasizes the validation of sender authenticity for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Take action now: Reduce email phishing and ensure deliverability</p>
<p>Strong authentication with DMARC and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> is an important milestone for email users.</p>
<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology. Entrust also offers DMARC implementation services to help customers in their BIMI journey. Check if your domain is BIMI ready using this free <a href="https://redsift.com/tools/bimi">online tool</a> from our partner Red Sift.</p>
<p>As Google and Yahoo make email authentication mandatory, industry-wide adoption of these practices is crucial. Businesses can ensure compliance for improved email deliverability and overall security.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Over the past few years, digital transformation has been relentless. Businesses of all sizes are at the forefront, continuously adapting to an ever-evolving digital landscape. One of the biggest challenges is managing the surge in cyberattacks, where the number and sophistication of phishing attacks have reached unprecedented levels, especially since the adoption of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/generative-ai-security-challenges-fighting-fire-with-fire/">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a> has led to cybercriminals being able to launch more accurate and effective phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>The need to protect your organization from threats has never been greater. The introduction of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has also spotlighted the necessity for data security and compliance. On top of it all, with the omnipresence of smart devices and the IoT, we’re living in an era where everything is connected. This interconnectedness, along with the growing reliance on <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25362/card-not-present-transactions--friend-or-foe--transaction-volumes-are-soaring-but-so-is-fraud">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a> facilitated by digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, accentuates the need for secure digital payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers demand secure, seamless digital experiences</p>
<p>Along with these challenges, today’s customers have become well-informed, and their demands have never been clearer. They want a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">mobile-first experience</a>, where their digital journey is seamless on their preferred device. Beyond just accessibility, they expect robust protection against fraud and the looming threats of advanced cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Speed and ease are paramount, with customers seeking frictionless access that doesn’t compromise their security and allows them to switch seamlessly from one device to another to continue their journey. Furthermore, the modern customer isn’t content with a one-size-fits-all approach. They want <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/601818?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=topic&amp;utm_content=upcoming">personalized digital interactions</a>, tailor-made to resonate with their unique preferences.</p>
<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM)</p>
<p>An effective customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution streamlines the digital onboarding process, making sign-ups both user-friendly and secure. It should support various login methods, including single sign-on (SSO), and integrate with popular social media platforms to streamline registration and login through social login. More than just managing identities, a CIAM solution enhances decision-making through intelligent access and detailed risk assessments, ensuring identity data remains consistent and unified across all platforms.</p>
<p>A CIAM solution’s impact on today’s business landscape is profound. It improves the user experience, which leads to increased sign-ups. This paves the way for building trust, as businesses can cultivate customer confidence with rigorous privacy measures and create personalized interactions. By delivering tailored services and products, the CIAM solution can boost sales and customer loyalty, while prioritizing safety through proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The Entrust difference</p>
<p>At Entrust, our vision of the CIAM lifecycle is holistic. Starting with seamless digital onboarding, our system is designed to efficiently capture and manage customer identity. Robust authentication protocols are then employed to verify user access, ensuring that only genuine and verified users gain entry. Proactive identity management provides comprehensive oversight throughout the entire customer journey, from sign-up to eventual offboarding.</p>
<p>Administration is equally paramount, with policy enforcement mechanisms and measures to ensure continuous compliance. Lastly, in line with modern demands, our CIAM system is equipped to provide tailored engagements, crafting custom experiences that build deeper customer bonds.</p>
<p>Our identity verification (IDV) and digital signing capabilities, together with the ease of social logins, make remote customer onboarding customers easy. This trio of technologies is pivotal in transforming user experiences across a broad spectrum of industries:</p>
 
 In the financial sector, it enables banks and fintech companies to rapidly verify and onboard new customers, streamlining account openings and loan applications 
 Healthcare organizations leverage this technology for secure patient registration and to ensure compliance with privacy regulations 
 Government bodies utilize these tools for efficient citizen onboarding, offering access to services with enhanced security and convenience 
 In the retail e-commerce space, these solutions simplify the shopping experience, making it easier for consumers to authenticate their identities, sign up for services, and complete transactions securely – all from the comfort of their homes or on the go

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>We undoubtedly live in interesting times, at least in terms of technological innovation. And like most things in life, this can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we respond to it. Technology certainly provides new opportunities, but these are typically accompanied by a set of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the proliferation of internet-connected devices that have quickly become part of everyday life. These range from smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers in the home that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80423/enabling-the-digital-business-with-identity-for-the-internet-of-things">internet of things</a> (IoT); to automatic and remote climate control, occupancy monitoring, and smart access controls in the office; to sensors and trackers for temperature, pressure, air quality, and noise levels on the factory floor that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_securing_iiot">industrial internet of things</a> (IIoT); to patient, blood glucose, heart rate, hygiene, and mood monitors that make of the internet of medical things (IoMT).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges associated with internet-connected devices&nbsp; 
<p>While all these devices are aimed at improving efficiency, productivity, and quality of life, they all come with challenges. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">attack surface</a>, making it challenging to manage and secure every device; the lack of standardized security protocols and frameworks across these devices leads to inconsistencies in security implementations; the lack of focus on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fernandez-cuesta">security by design</a> leads to vulnerabilities; these devices often collect and transmit sensitive data, raising privacy concerns; and weak <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-based-case-for-zero-trust-authentication-eic2023">authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc71144/dynamic-authorization-management">authorization</a> mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the challenges do not end there. Inadequate network security measures may expose devices to cyberattacks; vulnerabilities introduced during the manufacturing and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">supply chain</a> process may be exploited by attacker; devices can be tampered with; managing the entire lifecycle of devices, including updates and patches; and decentralized data processing in edge computing introduces additional security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity key to addressing IoT challenges&nbsp; 
<p>Identity plays a crucial role in addressing challenges associated with IoT, IIoT, and IoMT devices. Establishing identities for devices and users can ensure that only authorized entities have access to specific resources and functionality, while identity-based access policies enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained authorization rules to improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning unique identities to devices enables secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to a network, while implementing mutual authentication between devices and the network enhances overall security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can help prevent unauthorized access to internet-connected devices by managing the identity lifecycle proactively by implementing secure provisioning processes and ensuring that devices are decommissioned when no longer in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing identities for devices (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standards-framework-non-human-identities-eic2023">non-human identities</a>) and users enables organizations to analyze and monitor behavioral patterns. Anomalies indicating potential security threats can be detected and addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can improve privacy protection in consumer-facing applications by associating user identities with devices to enable personalized services, while respecting consumer privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of standardized identity protocols such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/3083/2">OAuth</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5077">OpenID Connect</a> ensures consistent and security identity management practices for internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking device and user identities helps with regulatory compliance because it enables organizations to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards through identity-based audit logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 It is all in the approach&nbsp; 
<p>And implementing a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach, where devices are not automatically trusted and must authenticate before accessing resources, will improve security but requires robust identity management during the onboarding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity-centric approaches, therefore, can contribute significantly to a more controlled, accountable, and secure environment, addressing many of the challenges introduced by the rapid adoption of internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the international identity community at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity &amp; Cloud conference</a> #EIC2024&nbsp; in June to discuss every aspect of identity across the wider IT landscape. There will be opportunities to learn about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5687/3">Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World</a>, to get insights into <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5568/1">How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization</a>, to get answers the question: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5504">Can you trust AI in IAM?</a>, to find out <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5509/1">How Identity Forces Are Making Enterprises Rethink Identity</a>, and much, much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on identity in the context of IoT, IIoT, and IoMT. These included presentations that considered how to make these identities and networks secure by design in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/safeguarding-iot-eic2023">Safeguarding IoT/OT/IIoT with Autonomous Networking</a>; how self-sovereign identity (SSI) enables decentralized identity and access management for things in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iot-with-decentralized-iam-eic2023">Empowering the Vision of the IoT with Decentralized IAM</a>; and the implications of applying SSI to IoT in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ssi-meets-iot-eic2023">When SSI meets IoT – challenges and opportunities</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those who have been following Holochain for a while have heard of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)</a>. In short, IOEN’s goal is to support a sustainable energy transition by enabling microgrids of local renewables to collectively account for the energy they produce and to engage in the global financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, they need a way for the individuals and communities that make up these microgrids to document their energy generation in a verifiable manner.</p><p>Holochain, <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>, <a href="https://gildlab.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GildLab</a>, and IOEN have teamed up to bring a working demonstration of verifiable energy to ETHDenver 2024. This will show how you can build a verifiable data system on Holochain and connect that system to an EVM, accessing financial opportunities like semi-fungible tokens and renewable energy certificates.</p> The Demo <p>To demonstrate the possibilities of verifiable energy generation at ETHDenver we are scaling down to the human level. With an <a href="https://www.getoffthegrid.ca/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Off the Grid</a> exercise bike set up as a human powered generator, we’re asking event participants to join in and create some energy with us.&nbsp;</p><p>As the bike produces a charge it will be measured with a sensor on its way to charge a battery. This data is then fed into a raspberry pi running a Holochain app that will transmit this data to an auditable <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT</a>. To tie that particular instance of energy generation to the person riding the bike, we’ll have them scan a QR code to connect the <a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">tokenproof app</a> (which they used for their ETHDenver tickets). Along with the profile from their tickets and the measurement of energy generated, an observer will post photographic evidence of the particular person riding the bike at the particular time that energy was generated.</p><p>Then, human power credits (developed for this demo) are minted and sent to the wallet the rider connected. These are then placed into the IOEN marketplace, where they will be aggregated into IOEN renewable energy certificates (IOEN RECs), and bought and retired using IOEN tokens — showing end-to-end value, tracking and transparency of data through the Holochain app, and showcasing opportunities for liquidity in decentralized energy generation and finance.</p> Demonstrating Verifiable Data <p>The exact data fields collected are particular to this demonstration. What is important are the ways we can layer data sources, building up context so that we can verify an event that occurred in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Having multiple sources of data which authenticate the same event allows for outside observers to verify the generation of that energy, compensating the individuals who generated the energy.&nbsp; Holochain provides a self-validating system where this data can be stored and managed. Because you can audit not just storage but also actions within Holochain it allows data to be updated over time. And because Holochain uses distributed peer-to-peer networks, there aren’t the data limits or transaction costs of blockchains. Plus now with Rainlang, we can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-a-new-link-in-web3/">connect the data in Holochain to EVM transactions</a>, securely linking the financials with the data.</p><p>This system has been developed to prototype verifiable data, and these same principles can be customized to any particular use case. Different regulators need different types of information depending on the industry. The goal is to show how multiple data sources can be layered in a self-validating environment and used to connect the digital environment to real world assets. From there, systems for automated witnessing and the validation of outputs can be developed.</p> The Use Case <p>So, what is the use case at scale?</p><p>Renewable energy certificates (RECs) offer businesses a way to offset their use of non-renewable energy by supporting renewables. Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.</p><p>IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.</p><p>For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).</p><p>IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.</p><p>With integrations for tokenizing the assets almost finished, the ETHDenver demo is the prototype that shows how this will function embedded with Holochain when complete.&nbsp;</p> The Finances <p>So, what does any of this have to do with blockchains?</p><p>By connecting the sale and consumption of RECs to the financial markets of blockchains, we can open up a few new DeFi-driven opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.</p><p>Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy.&nbsp;</p> What It Means <p>IOEN is opening access to global financial opportunities and creating an economy of scale by aggregating small producers. This is part of a strategy for transition. By leveraging DeFi to finance a sustainable energy transition, the goal is to eventually move to a truly decentralized physical infrastructure for renewable energy generation. At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables. Microgrids, with mutual credit currencies to manage and account for the local production and consumption of energy, auditable at the global level, will be the DePIN future for energy. IOEN is developing the tools that will help us make that transition and build the foundations of that future. </p>

  <p>Howdy folks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce support for additional capabilities now available for&nbsp;Conditional Access reauthentication policy scenarios. Reauthentication policy lets you require users to interactively provide their credentials again - typically before accessing critical applications and taking sensitive actions. Combined with Conditional Access session control of Sign-in frequency, you can require reauthentication for users and sign-ins with risk, or for Intune enrollment. With today's public preview, now you can require reauthentication for any resource protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell you more about this capability, I’ve invited Inbar Cizer Kobrinsky, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Entra, to talk about the scenarios and configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you more about the public preview capabilities that we’re adding to the “Sign-in frequency – every time” session control in Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single sign-on (SSO) using modern authentication is like a secret sauce for productivity and security. It improves productivity because users can access applications smoothly without signing in to each one with their credentials. SSO also enhances security because it reduces the risks of credential reuse and gives you a common point for control and logging for your Zero Trust deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are situations where you may want the user's input, such as interactive authentication, before accessing a resource. One of these situations is token theft. A token theft attack occurs when threat actors compromise and replay tokens issued to a user, even if that user has satisfied multifactor authentication (MFA). Because authentication requirements are met, the threat actor is granted access to organizational resources by using the stolen token. Risk-based reauthentication policies can help lower the risk that results from a token theft, requiring threat actors to compromise a fresh token to regain system access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some additional examples of these situations, where you may want to prompt the user for reauthentication:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Accessing high-risk resources, such as connecting to a VPN.&nbsp; 
 Activating a privileged role in Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp; 
 Performing an action within an application, such as changing personal information in an HR application.&nbsp; 
 Critical actions such as Intune enrollment or updating credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Risky sign-ins, as called out above, help reduce and mitigate the risk of token theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the latest update, you now can create policies requiring interactive reauthentication for any application or authentication context protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, we’ve created a reauthentication policy for super sensitive actions, such as wire transfer. We’re using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a>, which the developer has integrated into the application. Before a user can transfer any amount from the application, they must satisfy the Conditional Access policy that targets this authentication context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Create a "sign-in frequency - every time" policy for super sensitive actions using authentication context</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conditional Access policy for this authentication context requires phishing-resistant authentication (using authentication strength) and “Sign-in frequency – every time”. The next time a user attempts to make a wire transfer, they will be required to reauthenticate with a phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 IDnow’s recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report explores the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits use risky channels. 



 



<p>2023 proved to be a monumental year for fraud in the UK. In fact, by the middle of the year, the losses attributed to fraud <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/oct/25/uk-consumer-lose-580m-fraudster-first-half-2023-romance-scam-id-theft-fastest-growing-categories">were already £580 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year was also important for the steps that the UK government pledged to take to address fraud. Chief among these was the release of its fraud strategy, which, the government hopes, will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-fraud-charter-2023">Online Fraud Charter</a> was also launched in 2023, which is a voluntary agreement between the government and technology sector to reduce fraud on their platforms and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these initiatives will hopefully go some way to encourage the public and private sector to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, they will not necessarily address perhaps the most important challenge: educating the public in a tangible, meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aim of investigating the British public’s awareness of fraud and its attitudes toward fraud prevention technology, we created the inaugural IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report.&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


<p>In the first of a three-part blog series, we explore the fraud education levels of the British population, the areas of life most susceptible to fraud, and users’ behavior around insecure digital communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing the awareness of fraud. 



<p>If there was one term that appeared to be on everybody’s lips (from the fraud prevention community) last year, it was ‘deepfakes.’ However, despite some widely circulated deepfake videos of famous politicians making headlines in 2023, we discovered that almost half (47%) of Brits said that they do not know what deepfakes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We define deepfakes as deceptively lifelike, manipulated images, audio or video recordings. The quality of deepfakes is constantly improving as computing power increases and AI advances, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and artificially created or altered material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social engineering, unlike other forms of cyberattacks, appeals to human vulnerabilities and emotions. For example, in romance fraud, the fraudster uses social engineering to build up a rapport with the victim with the intention of tricking them into registering for a service or transferring funds. Worryingly, we discovered that more than half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we did discover some positives regarding the British public’s awareness of fraud terms. A vast majority (83%) of respondents say they know what ‘phishing’ is (gathering a victim’s personal information, such as credentials or payment information, by getting them to click on a malicious link or attachment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although many respondents were not aware of the definitions of the latest forms of fraud, an overwhelming number (93%) say they are concerned about fraud in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Which industry is most susceptible to fraud? 



<p>Despite a majority (73%) of Brits believing their bank is effective in safeguarding their financial assets, three quarters (75%) of respondents said banking was the industry they were most concerned about when it comes to fraud. More than half (55%) of UK adults say they are also concerned about online shopping fraud, followed by a third of the population (37%) citing social media fraud as a worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked to assess the risk levels of different crimes: 32% think they are most at risk of someone having access to their bank account through identity fraud; another 21% of Brits think they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the different types of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other industries are also perceived as rife with fraud. Around 2 in 10 Brits are concerned about insurance fraud (19%); 14% worry about fraud in cryptocurrency, eGovernment (13%), online dating (13%), travel (12%) and telecoms (11%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover the steps that one woman is taking to expose romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Which channel is considered the riskiest? 



<p>Despite 97% of respondents knowing what identity theft means, and widespread concern about fraud in various areas of life, a third of Brits (33%) have admitted to sharing scans or photos of ID cards, driving licenses or passports via insecure and largely unencrypted channels, such as social media, email or messenger apps.&nbsp;Of these people, almost half (45%) said they were aware that these document scans or photos could land in the hands of fraudsters but&nbsp;proceeded to share these scans or photos anyway. This is a clear indicator that consumers are either unaware of an alternative way of verification (for example, via an identity verification solution) or the service they were trying to access did not offer a secure channel. It also highlights the importance for businesses to provide secure digital channels for customers to share personal information.&nbsp;</p>



 How IDnow helps prevent fraud. 



<p>IDnow offers comprehensive fraud prevention solutions to safeguard against various types of fraud, including social engineering, fake IDs, identity fraud, and much more. Our automated document verification and biometric checks, including selfie and face match, verify users’ identities with precision, while our passive liveness detection feature adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that genuine customers are verified seamlessly. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We also offer an expert-assisted video verification process, where trained professionals who verify users’ documents and ask security and fraud related questions looking for any signs of suspicious behavior or social engineering attempts. Through real-time intervention and questioning, our experts can detect and prevent fraudulent activities effectively.&nbsp;</p>

             February 2024   
	 
		 
			 Why Do Asset Managers Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another significant news is Blackrock’s recent statement on tokenization, positioning it as the next step after the cryptocurrency spot ETFs. Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

<p>About Making Data Better episode 9, <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">“The Bigger Step: Want a Single Digital ID?”</a></p>
 The presumption of a singular ID&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new sort of attribute, a de facto ID? No, and the spectre of a singular ID distracts from the true potential of Digital ID to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

   Moving towards a passwordless future is crucial for cybersecurity. So many high-profile breaches highlight the vulnerability of relying on passwords. Embracing passkeys, digital credentials tied to user accounts, and applications, offers a more secure and user-friendly alternative.

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.  A lot of work to clean up the ‘workflows’, the processes that run pretty much everything in the conductor, leading to better testability, better performance, and more correctness.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.2/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20240206184429">full changelog</a> or skim through the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a>. If this is your first time using 0.2, make sure you read all the way down! And apologies for the coarseness of the second link — GitHub really needs to add a feature to let you filter by <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a>.</p><p>This release is paired with new libraries, developer tools, and infrastructure:</p>  HDI 0.3.6 and HDK 0.2.6 maintain compatibility with the WASM host API.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases/tag/v0.16.9?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client 0.16.9</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/releases/tag/v0.4.5?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust client 0.4.5</a> maintain compatibility with the conductor APIs, along with the usual bug fixes and code/API cleanups.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases/tag/v0.15.2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama 0.15.2</a> has been updated to JavaScript client 0.16 to give it compatibility with Holochain 0.2, and gets a new awaitDhtSync function, bringing back a useful feature Tryorama had back in the Holochain Redux days!  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/commit/ddb8b5a950e7be81d704000e662564696bef5d6b?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc-scaffold 0.2001.1</a> generates code that uses the latest HDI and HDK to maintain compatibility with 0.2.6.  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/hc-spin?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc spin</a>, a new dev tool, spins up one or more conductors with your hApp running in them, opens up your UI in an <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Electron-based container</a> (a sort of mini-Launcher), and runs local network services. You can also configure it to use existing network services, your own UI dev server, and a specific Holochain binary on your machine. We’re moving our UI tools back to Electron, as we’ve found Tauri’s cross-OS compatibility isn’t quite there yet. hc launch, the Tauri equivalent, is still available.  The public bootstrap server bootstrap.holo.host has been updated.  There are two new servers for the new WebRTC networking, signal.holo.host for connection establishment and turn.holo.host for traffic proxying.  There’s a new dev tool command, hc run-local-services, that will run bootstrap and connection establishment services for machines on your local network.   Holochain 0.2 migration guide <p>I think this news is so awesome I’m giving it its own section. The <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/upgrade-holochain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.1 to 0.2 migration guide</a> has been expanded to give you step-by-step instructions on exactly what you need to do to get your existing Holochain 0.1-compatible hApp running on 0.2. It’s very thorough, incorporating a bunch of guidance and solutions gleaned from many months of helping devs migrate their hApps.</p><p><a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/upgrade-holochain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Give it a read and start upgrading your hApp!</a></p> ETHDenver this week <p>Holochain is going to be present at <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver</a> in Colorado, USA again this year.

				  Learn why building decentralized identity functionality into your existing solutions has never been simpler with the Indicio mobile SDK.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule was implemented in the Philippines in February&nbsp;2021.  There is no minimum threshold in the Philippines for the Travel Rule to kick in, as originating and beneficiary VASPs must collect and share names and account numbers/unique reference numbers of their customers for all transactions.  The extent of information that VASPs are required to collect and share increases substantially when the value of crypto transactions exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).  <p>In 2021, the Philippines joined the Asia-Pacific Group and became a member of FATF-Style Regional Bodies. The same year, Bangko Sentral NG Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s Central Bank, released <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">Circular 1108</a> to provide guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which included the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>With that, the FATF Travel Rule went into effect in February 2021 in the Philippines. As a result, crypto exchanges and service providers are now all required to follow the Philippines Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1742507280870822106">Image Source</a>)<p>This year, the Philippines has begun tightening Travel Rule requirements even further to strengthen the country’s AML and CFT measures against any illicit crypto transactions.</p> What is a VASP in the Philippines? <p>A VASP, according to BSP, is any entity that offers services facilitating the transfer or exchange of virtual assets and is involved in the following activities:</p>  Exchange between fiat currencies and virtual&nbsp;assets;  Exchange between different types of virtual&nbsp;assets;  Crypto transfer, and  Administration and/or safekeeping of crypto or instruments enabling control over&nbsp;crypto   Complying With the FATF Travel Rule in the Philippines <p>According to the country’s Central Bank, VASPs must share the following information with their corresponding VASPs for all crypto transactions, irrespective of the&nbsp;amount:</p>  Name  Account number or Unique reference number, if that is not available  <p>However, the extent of personally identifiable information that VASPs have to collect and share with their corresponding VASPs increases substantially when the amount of crypto transaction exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p><p>In such cases, VASPs are required to collect and share the following information:</p>  Name  Physical address  Date &amp; place of&nbsp;birth.  Account number  <p>Additionally, originating and beneficiary VASPs must establish and actively adhere to strict sanction screening procedures. They must also screen all transacting parties against terrorist financing lists and adverse media&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must perform necessary due diligence on the transfer of virtual assets to and from countries that haven’t implemented the FATF Travel Rule yet. They also have to exercise caution and perform enhanced due diligence when dealing with crypto transfers using unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>The Travel Rule is part of a broader set of recommendations by the global anti-money laundering watchdog, the FATF, which included the Philippines in its ‘grey list.’ As a result of this, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines have increased monitoring in order to maintain their trade relations and gain access to international finance.</p><p>Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, have already taken similar action and have tightened up regulations on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, several countries such as Singapore, Switzerland, Estonia, South Korea, Canada, Japan, the US, and the UK have also adopted the Crypto Travel Rule and require digital asset service providers to maintain customer information and establish procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT measures.</p><p>The Philippines’ Travel Rule threshold is in line with the FATF’s $1,000 limit and more or less in conformity with other countries. In Singapore, the threshold for collecting and recording sender and receiver information is SGD 1,500 (about $1,115), while in the United States, it’s $3,000. However, in Estonia and Malaysia, there’s no minimum amount requirement for gathering this information.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While the Philippines has taken significant steps to align with international standards by implementing the FATF Travel Rule for cryptocurrency transactions, these regulations have sparked a debate about their&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By setting requirements for VASPs to collect and share detailed information on transactions, the country aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the increasing regulatory measures, including the latest tightening of the Travel Rule, highlight the ongoing tension between ensuring financial security and maintaining the open, decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency.</p><p>This delicate balance continues to shape the landscape of crypto regulation both in the Philippines and around the world. Amid this, it’s crucial for both regulators and industry representatives to remember that user security and experience should always be a priority.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What Are VASPs Required to Do Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They must collect and exchange personal information for transactions exceeding ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p> Q2: Who Qualifies as a VASP in the Philippines? <p>Entities that facilitate the transfer or exchange of virtual assets, including exchanges between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</p> Q3: What Happens if VASPs Fail to Follow the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They may face regulatory penalties, including fines and revocation of their operating license, for non-compliance with the BSP’s guidelines.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Deletion Activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard deletion activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore activity &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Group &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore user  &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore application &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete administrative unit &nbsp;</p>


<p>(hard delete not possible) &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Administrative Unit &nbsp;</p>




<p>Remove service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard delete service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore service principal &nbsp;</p>




<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>

 Further Testing &amp; Enhancement Underway in Collaboration with VRS Provider Community <p>NEWTOWN, PA — February 22, 2024 — <a href="https://ledgerdomain.com/">LedgerDomain</a> and Spherity, leading providers in digital credentialing services, today announced results from their latest performance testing, exceeding the current<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/"> Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a> requirements for the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Enacted in 2013, DSCSA requires end-to-end traceability for the vast majority of prescription drug products, preventing counterfeit or illegitimate products from reaching patients.</p><p>With OCI-compliant credentials, DSCSA stakeholders can digitally interact with each other, even if they have no prior business relationship and use different solution providers. These stakeholders include Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) as defined by the statute (i.e. manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, 3PLs, and dispensers) alongside federal and state authorities and ATP Equivalents.</p><p>With 4.9 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. each year, high performance is essential to ensuring supply chain resilience and security. In rigorous testing scenarios, both LedgerDomain and Spherity demonstrated performance speeds for their VP Generate and VP Verify API endpoints at least twice as fast as the baseline established by the OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria. Under the OCI specification, both calls should average no more than 1500 milliseconds.</p><p>OCI-compliant credentials integrate with the Verification Router Service (VRS), a network designed to pass drug package verification requests between trading partners. As the recognized digital method for secure electronic message interoperability, OCI-compliant credentials also integrate with other channels, such as email and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for&nbsp;tracing.</p><p>Both LedgerDomain and Spherity continue to work closely with VRS partners to further enhance performance times to ensure real-time security and reliability. This broader effort in collaboration with VRS providers encompasses end-to-end performance.</p><p>“During the course of the current FDA Stabilization Period, solution providers are tuning up their systems to deliver the speed and reliability that the supply chain demands. We’re collaborating closely with our partners to resolve variations in end-to-end verification performance metrics as the VRS scales up through the spring.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcolgan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYPCFwBxAVNlVQWIPRuC5SrU4qYiYIRJEQ&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BWkzq0kbvQEeBllraqJpiyA%3D%3D">Alex Colgan</a>, head of marketing and partnerships, LedgerDomain</p><p>“Interoperable networks like the VRS are only possible when all stakeholders pull together. We’re working hard to further scale our infrastructure with minimal latency and maximum throughput.” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswirrig/">Chris Wirrig</a>, customer success manager,&nbsp;Spherity</p><p>“Bringing enhanced drug distribution security under the DSCSA to life has been a decade-long effort, and the VRS is a cornerstone of this interoperable ‘system of systems.’ OCI-compliant credentialing adds a digital layer of secure authentication to the VRS, so that trading partners can exchange data with confidence.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwaldorf?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACVUfMBzqFzp5bfWQydohbDTd2khyK2kLs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BhLO9w2ecSbCTnQPjw44S6w%3D%3D">Elizabeth Waldorf</a>, Director, Global Traceability and Standards, TraceLink</p><p>This progress comes ahead of the upcoming Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) Distribution Management Conference (DMC) in March, where both LedgerDomain and Spherity will be present. For more information on the OCI DSCSA Interoperability Specification and its role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, visit <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">oc-i.org</a>.</p><p>About LedgerDomain</p><p>LedgerDomain is a decentralized solutions provider focused on healthcare supply chain assurance and visibility. Their XATP solution enables trading partners including global enterprises, health centers, and independent pharmacists to comply with DSCSA requirements for authentication, enhanced verification, tracing, and saleable returns documentation — helping prescription drugs remain safe and effective for patients.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p>Spherity is a pioneer in decentralized identity and data sovereignty solutions. Their innovative technology focuses on solutions for industry use cases, that automate processes by digitizing company or product certificates and the exchange of sensitive industry data. Spherity is offering solutions for the US Pharma Industry, the global automotive industry, and has a special focus on Digital Product Passport Solutions for all ESPR-regulated product categories.</p><p>About OCI</p><p>The Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative non-profit industry collaboration formed in April 2021 by a group of trading partners, solution providers, and standards organizations to support the pharmaceutical industry in adopting credentialing and digital wallet technologies to enhance supply chain security, and thus the protection of consumers.</p><p>Building on the DSCSA statute and FDA guidances, the Partnership for DSCSA Governance (PDG), GS1 US, Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA), and OCI are the organizations that have developed and published the business requirements, standards, and specifications that collectively define the DSCSA Enhanced Drug Distribution Security (EDDS) system. OCI provides open-source specifications built on interoperable standards defined by GS1, W3C, and NIST in close collaboration with industry stakeholders.</p><p>The OCI ecosystem is open to trading partners, solution providers, associations, standards bodies and others interested in contributing to future enhancements of the architecture and use&nbsp;cases.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/ledgerdomain-and-spherity-surpass-oci-performance-standards-in-latest-api-tests-4cf6fcd9ac23">Spherity and LedgerDomain Surpass OCI Performance Standards in Latest API Tests</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  We’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
 How does this affect my experience on Bluesky? 
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
 If my experience doesn’t change, why federate? 
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
 Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon? 
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
 
 A focus on the global conversation: On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted. 
 Composable moderation: Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon. 
 Composable feeds: We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds. 
 Account portability: We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts. 
 
 So how can I self-host and join the network? 
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. If you’re excited to jump in, checkout the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">PDS repo</a> on our Github, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/UWS6FFdhMe">PDS Administrators Discord</a>.</p>

<p>January was a whirlwind month for SpruceID, as we dove headfirst into a series of impactful events, each shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its implications for society.<br><br>Let's take a moment to recap the highlights from our events throughout January.</p> January 17th: Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day <p>The start of our year kicked off with Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day in DC, an event organized by Okta Ventures that explored the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and government service delivery.<br><br>Our CEO, Wayne Chang, was at the forefront, participating in a CEO panel discussion about restoring citizen trust in government institutions. Alongside Karine Mellata of Intrinsic AI and Matt Chiodi of Cerby, Wayne articulated SpruceID's commitment to empowering users to control their data on the web, a mission deeply intertwined with rebuilding faith in governmental processes. <br><br>SpruceID also had a booth at the conference where we had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with staffers interested in learning more about verifiable digital credentials.<br><br>We were honored to have kicked off our year with this exciting event, where we were able to help educate congressional staffers on digital identity, the risks of AI related to identity, and network with others in the space.</p> January 19th: New York State Digital Identity Roundtable <p>Next on our agenda was the New York State Digital Identity Roundtable, a thought-provoking forum delving into the landscape of digital identity in New York. The event was organized by Assemblywoman Solages, who sponsored Bill A01018 which paves the way for mobile driver's licenses in New York.<br><br>SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang opened the event with an overview of digital credentials, the risks and privacy concerns that should be considered, and the importance of verifiable digital identity with the increased sophistication of AI impersonations.<br><br>Round table participants, including members of the New York government, leading tech companies, and multiple privacy-oriented and civil liberties organizations, posed crucial questions surrounding privacy, security, and inclusivity in the digital identity landscape.<br><br>From concerns about bias and exclusion to discussions about democratic oversight, the conversations during this roundtable underscored the need for robust, transparent frameworks to guide the deployment of digital identity solutions. We were honored to participate in this roundtable and look forward to continuing the conversation on many of these important issues.</p> January 25th: Milan Digital Identity Observatory Workshop <p>Rounding out our month was the Digital Identity Observatory Workshop, a collaborative event to help chart the course for the future of digital identity. CIOs and digital transformation executives from leading European multinational corporations converged in Milan to explore emerging trends, opportunities, and challenges with verifiable digital identity. Through discussions and interactive sessions, participants charted a path forward grounded in privacy, security, and user empowerment principles.<br><br>SpruceID joined virtually with a brief presentation from Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, recapping our digital identity tech, national and global trends, and emerging best practices and use cases for verifying digital credentials in business workflows.<br><br>As we look ahead, SpruceID remains committed to driving the conversation around digital identity, advocating for solutions that prioritize the rights and well-being of individuals in an increasingly digital world.</p> Stay Tuned for What’s Next! <p>January was a busy month of community engagement and thought leadership for SpruceID. As we reflect on the insights gained and connections made during last month’s events, we remain eager in our mission to build a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions. Stay tuned for more updates as we join in on more exciting events in the coming months.<br></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

  <p>Over 800,000 organizations rely on Microsoft Entra to navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, ensuring their security while enhancing the productivity of their end users. Customers have frequently expressed their desire for greater transparency into their Entra usage, with licensing being a particularly popular request. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Entra license utilization portal, a new feature that enables customers to optimize their Entra ID Premium licenses by providing insights into the current usage of premium features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide an overview of Entra ID license utilization, including what it is, how it works, and how you can optimize your license to get the most out of your Entra ID Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Try the public preview 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The license utilization &amp; insights portal is available under the “Usage &amp; Insights” blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1. License utilization insights portal under Usage &amp; Insights blade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portal would provide you with insights into the top features you’re using that correspond with your Entra ID Premium P1 and P2 licenses (as applicable). You can leverage these insights to secure and govern your users along with ensuring you comply with the licensing terms and conditions. Here is a screenshot of feature usage view you can see in the Entra portal:</p>
<p>Figure 2. Entra ID Premium P1 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3. Entra ID Premium P2 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to extend this transparency into Entra usage and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability, as well as what would be most useful to you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode we talk with Phil Windley, Sr. Software Development Manager at AWS, Cofounder of IIW, former Chair of Sovrin Foundation. We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior. We hope this an interesting episode. We’re glad we got to tell a small part of the Sovrin story as we think a lot of today’s reusable ID projects have their roots in the movement Sovrin started—including Trinsic.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Phil you can visit his personal website <a href="https://windley.com/">https://windley.com/</a> where you'll find ways to contact him, and buy his new book.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>

 From romance fraud to investment scams, there are a multitude of ways that fraudsters use social media to target victims. Here, we explore some of the most common and speak to one man who almost lost it all. 



 



<p>In 2024, it’s safe to say that if you use the internet, you’re more than likely to also use social media. In fact, of the 5.35 billion active global internet users, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5 billion are regular social media users.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you want to look at photos of somebody you haven’t spoken to in 15 years, swipe on photos of somebody you’d like to speak to for the next 15 years, read about the latest conspiracy theory, or apply for a job, there’s a specific social media platform to connect with old and new friends alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beauty of social media is how easily you can connect with people. Unfortunately, the danger of social media is also how easily you can, without any substantial identity verification check, create an account and claim to be whoever you want to be. Simply choose a name, select a photo and hey presto – you have an account. With just a few clicks, you’re free to contact with anyone on the internet. Free to share cat photos, argue why the moon is made of cheese, send your CV, or steal money from a complete stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 It starts with a click. 



<p>In the first six months of 2023, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers#1">$2.7 billion was lost through social media fraud</a>. Massive numbers compared to the next most common fraud channel: website and apps, which claimed $2 billion, or emails, which were responsible for the comparatively low figure of just $900 million. Little wonder, then, that for one in four people who’ve been defrauded since 2021, the initial communication began on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, it’s likely that you have already been contacted via a scammer, and you may not even know it. Here are the top three types of social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Romance scam. 



<p>Romance fraud is a type of scam initiated through social engineering, where emotional relationships are created to obtain financial gain or services. Romance scammers often use dating apps, but reports show that social media platforms are becoming even more common. While some dating apps, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/tinder-is-expanding-id-verification-to-the-us-uk-brazil-and-mexico/">Tinder are beginning to introduce identity verification</a> steps into onboarding, many do not.&nbsp;</p>

 Social media account takeover fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>37% of UK adults worry about social media fraud, according to our recently released <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024</a>. This fear is well founded, as someone who has access to your social media account can gather valuable information and photos about you and your family and friends for future fraud attacks. They can also post phishing attacks and links to investment scams from your account, lending the scam a convincing air of credibility and authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 Investment scam / pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common forms of social media fraud. Investment scams are typically ‘long con’ techniques that take place over a series of weeks or months, with the fraudster slowly establishing trust before presenting the victim with an investment opportunity. Although the website and payment portals shared may look genuine, any money that the victim sends is being transferred directly to the scammer. A variation of the investment scam is the pig butchering scam, which combines elements from romance scams, investment schemes, and crypto fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 “We just clicked.”&nbsp; 



<p>Anyone can be targeted by social media fraud. Young or old. Blue or white collar. After reading our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">‘Welcome to the fraud factory: Home of the pig butchering scam.’</a> IDnow was contacted by a German entrepreneur who realized that he had been defrauded. Below, we share his story:&nbsp;</p>



 Background. 



<p>I am an executive of a tech startup based in Europe, and 2023 marked a significant turning point for our company as it transitioned into a stock corporation. As the CEO, my primary responsibilities included securing financing, managing investor relationships, and selling shares to fuel the growth of the company. The second quarter of 2023 was particularly challenging, filled with numerous investor meetings and a determined push to promote our investment opportunities through Google Ads. It was during this period that I was contacted by a seemingly enthusiastic investor over LinkedIn, setting off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the company and my personal life.&nbsp;</p>



 The encounter.&nbsp; 



<p>In early May 2023, I received a message on LinkedIn from a young lady expressing her interest in investing in our stock corporation. Intrigued by her enthusiasm and apparent financial success, I engaged in a conversation with her. We quickly transitioned from LinkedIn to Telegram, and eventually she asked to switch to WhatsApp, and we exchanged phone numbers. She presented herself as a 37-year-old, successful investor in the art industry, with numerous investments in art galleries, including one in Hamburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our conversations continued, she began sharing details about her immense wealth and philanthropic endeavors, especially her interest in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs</a>). She frequently flaunted her account balance, boasting of having millions of USDT (cryptocurrency with a value that mirrors the US dollar) at her disposal. She assured me that investing in digital artwork would be a profitable venture for our struggling company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under her influence, I started investing in digital artwork on a platform called [removed], which frequently changed its domain. As she gained my trust, she probed for information about my net worth and assets, believing she was dealing with a financially stable partner. In reality, though, our company was facing dire financial straits, and I was desperate to secure the necessary financing to prevent bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The ‘golden opportunity.’ 



<p>Then came the golden opportunity. She suggested purchasing a highly valuable piece of digital artwork, similar to the popular ‘bored ape’ NFTs, with the intention of putting it up for auction. I agreed to the purchase, spending $850,000, with the expectation that it would be sold for a substantial profit. A week later, it was indeed sold for $8,129,000, bringing immense relief as it seemed like a way to recover our company’s financial troubles and my personal investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the moment I attempted to withdraw the funds, my joy turned to despair. I was asked to transfer 20% of the auction price, amounting to over $1.6 million, to a different wallet. Subsequently, they demanded an “advanced certification audit,” requiring me to provide extensive personal information, including bank statements, the source of my funds (my house and other assets), and a copy of my passport. A few days later, I received the shocking news that my account had been frozen due to suspicion of money laundering. To regain access, I was told to pay an additional $547,000 fee with a promise of a refund upon a positive outcome of the audit. Late September marked the realization that I had fallen victim to a complex and devastating scam known as pig butchering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aftermath. 



<p>Despair took hold, and I sought help from white hat hackers in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth and recover my investments. Unfortunately, I encountered fraudulent individuals who claimed to be white hat hackers and extorted thousands of dollars from me under the pretence of uncovering the fraud. Today, the company faces imminent administrative shutdown, forcing the dismissal of all employees, and I am left with no choice but to file for insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



 What happened next? 



<p>The anonymous reader lost €900,000 in total. In the months since discovering the deception, he has contacted lawyers, forensic hackers and the police, all to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawyer offered to trace and try to find the responsible company, but as you know, they are typically not registered and change their domains every three months.”</p>



<p>Although the forensic hackers did manage to locate the Wallet that contained the funds, they were unable to crack it, due to its Advanced Information Management Security Computer System (AIM), which was installed by a cyber security group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is therefore looking unlikely that he will ever be able to recover the funds, so for the time being, he is focusing on recovering and staying positive.</p>

 What’s so social about social media fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>With <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWiv_-gKiEAxUDUUEAHatSAXcQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F12%2Flinkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OOaCHGFxTZi5nUbm6kAb_&amp;opi=89978449">recent steps by LinkedIn</a> to introduce an identity verification step, could the era of social media anonymity, which inarguably leads to the proliferation of social media fraud, be coming to an end? Considering LinkedIn’s step is only encouraged and not mandatory, the answer is probably “no, not yet…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flaws and loopholes also exist in X (formally Twitter) and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2osmUgaiEAxUgV0EAHR9SAcUQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hootsuite.com%2Fmeta-verified%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vp0omcgNlBwL9v3MzxTnu&amp;opi=89978449">Meta’s verification strategies</a>, with only paid subscribers able to become verified. Identity verification only works if everybody participates; if it is not mandatory then it’s largely pointless. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Becky Holmes, the ‘romance fraud vigilante-turned-author’</a>, the decision to offer verification for a fee is a fraudster’s dream. “Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, what’s stopping a fraudster just paying for the premium service and benefiting from the associated prestige?&nbsp;</p>



 How to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of this year. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industries, including financial services, gambling, mobility, travel, and telecommunications have all embraced the potential of digital identity verification. Some industries, like financial services remain at the forefront of digital identity verification adoption, as they are required by regulations to have certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> and identity checks in place. While identity verification can help businesses meet compliance challenges and protect their business and customers from fraud, other industries are motivated more by its ability to optimize processes and scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, until social media platforms adopt meaningful and comprehensive identity verification, users should connect with caution. Here are three top tips to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



  Stay aware.  



<p>From the latest terms, like social engineering or deepfakes, it’s important to have a rudimentary understanding of what they include, so that you can remain vigilant, and know what steps to take if you are suspicious of a new contact.</p>



  Don’t just click.  



<p>Never click on links from your social media contacts, especially if they are new ‘friends.’ Only move to encrypted channels when you are totally sure that they are who they say there are, and of their intentions. If you suspect that your friend’s account has been hacked, contact them via a secure platform to make sure it’s them.&nbsp;</p>



  Don’t send.  



<p>Never send money to a social media contact. Regardless of how many times you’ve messaged, how well they know you, or how good the opportunity is. Beware of investment platforms, and crypto payment portals, as criminals are incredibly skilled in creating fake websites.</p>

 IDnow fraud survey reveals: 33% of Brits share sensitive ID documents unprotected online, with youth most at risk. 



 



  33% of Brits have shared scans or photos of an ID card, driving licence or passport via digital channels, such as social media or email, despite knowing that these ID documents could land in the wrong hands  The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about banking fraud  Over half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is, or the role it plays in fraud, with almost half not knowing what deepfakes are  



 



<p>London, February 20, 2024 – A major survey into attitudes and knowledge around fraud in the UK has been unveiled, with findings indicating a lack of knowledge around key tactics used by fraudsters, leaving Brits vulnerable to this crime, which is seeing exponential growth.</p>



<p>Commissioned by IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider, the YouGov survey of 2,264 people has uncovered that almost half (45%) of UK adults were aware that scans or photos of their ID documents could be obtained by criminals to be used to commit fraud – yet sent the documents via digital channels, such as email, social media and messenger apps anyway.</p>



<p>Such activity could lead to identity theft, which IDnow believes should be a concern to the UK public, especially given the rise in deepfake technology. Developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) mean deepfake technology can now be used to create hyper-realistic fake documents, as well as videos. However, the survey found that less than a third (31%) of Britons know what deepfake documents are and are aware of the potential risks posed by digitally generated images of physical documents.</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow, commented: “Many of us have seen the uncanny deepfake videos of celebrities that spread like wildfire across the internet, showing how easy it is to emulate the likeness of someone using AI. But worryingly, this research suggests that the UK public is not as concerned, or aware as they should be, of the risks associated with such digitally generated images or videos.</p>



<p>“The extraordinary leaps in AI technology mean it’s now almost too easy for a fraudster to carry out financial crimes. Consumers shouldn’t make it even easier for fraudsters though. Our advice is always to think twice before sending a scan or photo of your driving licence or passport into the digital ether via unencrypted channels, such as social media or email.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, 48% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed have shared ID documents via such risky channels, compared with just 21% of over-55s, highlighting the potential need to better educate the younger generation on digital fraud threats.</p>



 Is fraud front of mind? 



<p>The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking fraud</a>, when asked about the different areas of life where fraud could occur. An additional 37% of Brits are most concerned about fraud via social media channels.</p>



<p>With 54% of Brits unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, encompassing deceptive tactics such as phishing or smishing, the majority of the population remains vulnerable to potential fraud attempts. Social engineering, one of the most prevalent and hard to catch fraud typologies, sees fraudsters manipulating trust or fear, putting consumers at risk of divulging sensitive information or falling prey to malicious links disguised as trustworthy messages.</p>



<p>In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of crime, a fifth (21%) of Brits believe they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile. In fact, social media was the primary security concern for those aged 18- to 24-years-old, with each remaining age group citing their main worry as someone accessing their bank account through identity fraud.</p>



<p>Hence, for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, three quarters of Brits (75%) would be willing to go through a lengthier online onboarding process, if this made it safer. Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, explained: “Our findings show that banks in the UK do not always go far enough to make their customers feel safe and secure. They need to go further in terms of fraud prevention technology to meet their customers’ risk appetite, especially when their money is at stake. Because, and our research confirms this, if banks get it wrong, the majority of people (54%) would consider moving banks were they to become a victim of fraud. </p>



<p>“We hope these findings highlight the massive impact online fraud continues to have on British people. Because fraudsters work across industries, regions and use cases, it’s vital we all work together – financial services, technology providers, government, law enforcement and the public – to identify and stop fraudsters before it’s too late.”</p>



 



<p>About this study</p>



<p>This release is based on data from an online survey conducted by YouGov Germany, in which 2,264 people in the UK took part between 6 and 7 December 2023. The results were weighted and are representative of the UK population aged 18 and over.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The Era of Generative AI is upon us – there is no doubt about that. After over 50 years of academic research in artificial intelligence culminating in the development of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, and then another decade of building cybersecurity products based on those methods and trying to persuade customers to finally put their trust into them… The seemingly out-of-nowhere emergence of ChatGPT has managed to achieve that overnight.</p>
<p>Instead of a grumpy, suspicious crowd not willing to let AI automate their jobs, we now see a public craze that makes the Tulip Mania of the 17th century pale in comparison. Businesses are rushing to implement GenAI capabilities into all their processes and workflows. Vendors are struggling to come up with even more potential use cases to add generative capabilities to their products. But most importantly, literally everyone is happy to consume those capabilities again and again, disregarding potential risks and challenges (including being automated out of their jobs completely).</p>
<p>Even I couldn't resist asking DALL-E to create an illustration for the previous paragraph, and the result is quite impressive...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussing those risks for business applications of GenAI is a huge topic on its own. We already hear experts talking about lack of transparency, potential biases in training, compliance issues with leaking sensitive information to third parties, to say nothing about the massive costs of running LLM infrastructures. Still, the attempts of some organizations to outright ban ChatGPT usage on their premises have already been proven futile. Just like BYOD, this usage should be controlled by a combination of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/ai-regulation-challenges-and-opportunities">government-level regulation</a> and organizations’ own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-ai-acceptable-use-policy-aup-declan-van-esbeck-q9q6e/">acceptable use policies</a>.</p>
 Generative AI for cybersecurity practitioners 
<p>Still, today we want to focus on a more specific question: does the introduction of GenAI capabilities fundamentally change cybersecurity? What practical new functionality do they offer to security experts? And what are the challenges of developing and using security tools that rely on modern GenAI models?</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the most obvious use case doesn’t even require any additional interfaces between you and ChatGPT: it’s continuous education, an absolute must for every cybersecurity practitioner. Having a virtual assistant that can instantly answer any question and free you from doing your own research is a very alluring prospect indeed. You just have to remember that ChatGPT is not smarter than you. In fact, it works much more like a room full of hyperactive monkeys with typewriters, and not everything they produce is necessarily on par with Shakespeare. When an LLM does not know something, it will happily make up a completely wrong but still plausibly-looking answer, and it is entirely your responsibility to check its validity. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Trust but verify</a>!</p>
<p>Another related area is using LLMs for creating various materials for safe simulations of cybersecurity incidents. The idea itself is, of course, not at all new – tabletop exercises, incident response bootcamps and other kinds of training are a big part of every business continuity program, but using Generative AI does not just reduce the cost of such exercises but dramatically increases the degree of their realism – after all, real threat actors are already using very similar tools for their nefarious purposes. Again, just keep in mind that the cost of an error in this business is not at your advantage – a poorly crafted spear phishing mail will only leave a hacker with a bit of lost revenue, yet a poorly designed phishing awareness exercise might leave your entire company unprotected against multiple future attacks.</p>
<p>With the tremendous improvements LLMs are now making in generating not just natural language, but application source code as well, the idea of making new software “secure by design” by replacing human developers (that make so many coding mistakes and are impossible to teach to follow security practices!) with code generated directly by an AI model is getting more and more traction. In a similar way, LLMs can be used to create more sophisticated authorization policies, generate synthetic data for security testing, etc. In a slightly less radical approach, LLMs would not outright replace humans but serve as an additional filter in an existing CI/CD pipeline to improve its coverage and efficiency.</p>
<p>To be honest, looking at the results produced by current-generation tools, I’m somewhat skeptical about AI completely replacing human developers anytime soon, but the situation might change quickly. In any case, however, there is absolutely no reason to treat the code generated by AI as inherently error-free. You’ll still need to keep unit tests, static and dynamic code analysis solutions, and a lot of other security tools included in your development pipeline. Can you delegate all these activities to LLMs? Perhaps, but should you? In the end, it is still someone’s liability, and you cannot put than on AI…</p>
<p>But wait, someone reading this might say, what about arguably the most interesting application of Generative AI – specialized security-trained LLMs built into solutions like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>? Aren’t they the real future of cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Well, I cannot argue with that… to a degree. SIEMs, XDRs, and other security analytics solutions have been relying on various AI technologies for years, and the addition of GenAI does make them better in many ways. Providing better insights by cutting through the noise, helping to make critical incident response decisions faster, improving security analysts’ productivity – all these capabilities are great improvements, but they are not what makes a security tool reliable and scalable. Microsoft’s Copilot would never be so useful without the company’s existing vast telemetry network and threat intelligence database or their own cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even Charles Babbage, the inventor of the first programmable computer, already understood the principle that later became known as “Garbage in, garbage out” – not even the most sophisticated machine can make right decisions based on incomplete, flawed, or biased input data. For Generative AI, this applies to a much larger extent than anywhere else in IT. Perhaps, when you’re choosing the next best cybersecurity tool for your organization, looking at its GenAI-powered bells and whistles should not be on the top of your list of priorities.</p>
 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 
<p>In the end, we cannot deny the fact that Generative AI is indeed a game-changer in almost every industry, including cybersecurity. And yet it is critical for everyone to understand that GenAI does not do magic. It is just a tool - an extremely sophisticated, sometimes quite delicate, and very expensive one. A crucial part of integrating these tools into your security strategy is to clearly understand their capabilities and limitations (which tend to change literally on a weekly basis). Even more important is to be aware of how both the trailblazers and ordinary peers within your industry are using them to capitalize on their experience and avoid their mistakes.</p>
<p>And of course, there is no better platform to meet those people than the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">upcoming EIC 2024</a>, Europe’s prime conference on Digital ID, Security, Privacy and Governance in an AI-driven world, which will take place this June in Berlin, Germany. I hope to see you there as well!</p>

<p>Last Friday, we <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-step-by-step-guide-on-verifying-bitcoin-non-custodial-wallet-ownership-through-user-signing">published a blog post</a> that explained the user signing process on the Bitcoin network using Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. Today, we’re going to delve into the user signing process on the Ethereum network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the type of address you want to&nbsp;sign <p>First, we have to choose the type of cryptocurrency address to sign with, which is the Ethereum network in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 2: Connect Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Next, choose one of the four wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>If you don’t have a wallet account, tap on the “I don’t have a wallet” option on the left side of the screen. This will take you to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet#main-content">the Ethereum Foundations’ list of supported wallets</a>.</p><p>For this section, we chose&nbsp;Ledger.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Live <p>Now, you have to connect with Ledger Live, which you can do either through Ledger Live Mobile or the Ledger Live&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>For this guide, we will do it through the&nbsp;desktop.</p> Step 4: Connect to User&nbsp;Signing <p>You’ll then be prompted to connect to User Signing (dev.usersigning.shyft.network). Right click on both Ethereum and Polygon “Test on User Signing” options and click on the “Connect” button.</p> Step 5: Sign&nbsp;Address‍ <p>On this page, you will also see your selected Ethereum wallet address. Click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to a pop-up screen asking for your public key to continue the User Signing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Next, you have to open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p> Step 6: Open Your Ledger Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Now open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p><p>Next, on your Ledger device, you will be asked to confirm that you are the trust anchor of this public key and you own the given&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s it. You have now finished signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>After you sign the message, you’ll get a signature proof. This confirms that you own your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>We will now see a similar process on&nbsp;Trezor.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the Ethereum Network from the two available options — Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet‍ <p>Next, select from the four available wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and Trezor. For this segment, we will choose&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Scan&nbsp;Accounts <p>Now, click on the “Scan Accounts” button to get a list of your Ethereum wallet addresses. Doing so will take you to the next screen, where Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing&nbsp;service.</p><p>On this page, you have to click on the “Export” button. This helps you verify the address you own without exposing your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 4: Choose an Ethereum Wallet&nbsp;Address <p>Now, you will see a list of all your Ethereum addresses. From this list, choose the one address that you want to use for the User Signing process and click on the “Connect” button.</p><p>Once you do that, your Trezor wallet will be connected to Shyft User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>Here, you have to click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to the pop-up screen asking you to allow signing with your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>To sign the Ethereum message, click on the “Allow Once for This Session”&nbsp;button.</p> Step 6: Open Your Trezor Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Follow the instructions on your Trezor device and confirm that you are the trust anchor and own the given Ethereum wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>Next, your Trezor device will prompt you to confirm ownership of the address and verify you as the trust anchor for the public&nbsp;key.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>The verification is now complete, generating a signature proof.

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), ensuring the legitimacy of transactions to comply with regulatory standards such as the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining user privacy is crucial. However, this was easier said than done until <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Shyft launched User Signing</a> in late December last&nbsp;year.</p><p>With Shyft User Signing, VASPs now have a user-friendly and secure way for users to prove ownership of their non-custodial wallets.</p><p>In this guide, we outline the user signing process on the Bitcoin network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>The first step in the user signing process is to select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. In this case, we are focusing on the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step is to choose the hardware device that you will use to connect to your Bitcoin wallet. For this section, we will proceed with&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Trezor&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connecting your Trezor device is straightforward. Once you’ve selected Trezor as your hardware wallet, you’ll be prompted to connect the device to your computer and enter your&nbsp;PIN.</p><p>The service will then communicate with your Trezor to prepare it for&nbsp;signing.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing service. This is a crucial step as it allows the service to identify which address you’re proving ownership of without compromising your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>With your public key exported, the next step is to sign a message. This is done through the Trezor interface, where you will see a prompt to sign a Bitcoin message. Follow the instructions on your Trezor device’s screen to complete this&nbsp;step.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>Upon successful signing, you will receive a signature proof. This is a cryptographic string that proves you have signed a message with the private key corresponding to your public Bitcoin&nbsp;address.</p><p>Now, we will see a similar process with Ledger, another popular hardware crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. We selected the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step involves selecting your hardware device, which was Ledger in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connect your Ledger device to your computer, enter your PIN, and open the Bitcoin application on the device. The interface will then establish a connection with your Ledger and prepare it for the user signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Your Ledger will now ask permission to export your public key to the user signing service. This step is essential for the service to verify your address ownership securely.</p> Step 5: Sign the&nbsp;Message <p>Once your public key is exported, sign the message using your Ledger. Here, you will see the details of the message to sign. Now, confirm the message on your Ledger device to complete the signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>After signing the message, you’ll receive a signature proof — a cryptographic verification that you have used your private key to sign the message without exposing it. This proof is used to confirm ownership of your Bitcoin address securely.</p> Conclusion <p>User signing is a must-have for VASPs to keep transactions secure and compliant. With this guide, VASPs can help their users confidently verify their non-custodial Bitcoin wallets, making sure everyone’s on the same page with clear and secure processes.</p><p>If you wish to check the video of this entire process, you can head over here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

			  Fabio Espinosa is Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hello! I’m Fabio, originally from Colombia and currently living in Madrid. I work as a back-end software engineer at Tokeny. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology and how it has the potential to change people’s lives. Now, I think it is really cool to be able to work on technology myself.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as a tech lead at another startup and occasionally freelanced through Toptal.</p>
<p>I recognized a point in my career where my knowledge growth in programming had stagnated. Despite my experience in back-end, front-end, and dev ops, the work became repetitive, offering limited space for new things, and consequently, it was not so interesting anymore. Moreover, I was managing people, which was not giving me much joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this realization that made me curious to explore something new, particularly related to blockchain. Tokeny presented itself as an exciting opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Also, it’s widely recognized that tokenization is positioned for substantial growth—something that will take off. Such advancements hold significant potential, particularly for early entrants who typically experience disproportionate gains. This trend appears to be unfolding, as we are beginning to see growing interest from new investors wanting to join the market.</p>
<p>As Elon Musk says, “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it”. I chose the latter. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>I’d describe it as responsible freedom. The flexible work-from-home policy allows me to work from many locations, provided that expectations are met. This flexibility offers a great work-life balance.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a shared sense among the team that the industry is on the verge of taking off. While the exact timing remains uncertain, we are confident that it will inevitably happen.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokeny, a company is always about its people. In that regard, everyone at Tokeny is super awesome. We know how to have fun, connect, enjoy, share, learn, be there for one another, and share a good meme on the #random channel.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>It’s hard to find the thing I’m most passionate about. I can think of traveling, exploring cultures, writing, skiing, hiking, horse riding, creating things through code, enjoying food, music, spending time with family, and being there for my sisters, trips with friends.</p>
<p>But if I were to choose one, I’d say I’m most passionate about connecting with people. I live for interesting, deep conversations. When someone shares with me a bit of themselves they’d usually keep hidden or a strange, unique way to think about something, I honor it and feel connected.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream has always fluctuated over time. At some point, it used to be about money. I wanted to be as rich as not to have to work anymore and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see it differently. I mean, money will always be important, but my ultimate dream is to be constantly at peace with myself and aware enough to be in alignment with what is true to me the most I can.</p>
<p>On my deathbed, I want to look back and know that it wasn’t the external things that moved me, but the internal things, the really important ones.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>I’d say working from home is always a challenge. I’d advise creating an environment where you can both focus, and disconnect to take breaks. It’s funny how sometimes the most productive moments come after a long, nice break when you can look at the code with different eyes.</p>
<p>Let yourself be taken through the ride and try to develop consistency in your pace of work. Everyone is there to help you, so count on anyone; they all want to see you succeed.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>It excites me to work on something different from the usual corporate environment, within a small team, with significant upside potential, and contributing to beneficial technological progress for people.</p>
<p>I’m also super excited about the next team building event; they somehow keep getting better.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Graham Williamson</a></p>Efficient, effective management of access controls from infrastructure to applications remains an aspiration for enterprises. The main drivers of this goal include the need for strengthening the cybersecurity posture, efficiency gains in managing access controls, the need for consistency in access controls across multiple solutions and layers, and regulatory compliance. Most organizations today struggle with a mixture of point solutions for managing access controls, many of these relying on static entitlements causing massive work and tending to become inaccurate. A consistent, policy-based solution for managing access controls ensures that the right people have the right access, at the right time, from the right place.

This Leadership Compass features vendors offering policy-based access control solutions and provides guidance on aligning a vendor’s solution to common corporate access control requirements.

				 <p>The Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a change to drop overdraft fees to as low as $3. The average fee for overdrafts is over $26.</p>



<p>Why this matters: Financial institution’s bottom lines will be greatly affected. We are talking about the nation’s largest banks losing roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdraft-junk-fees-banking-biden-jpmorgan-cb8b19687264c0eed757d84911b44303">$8 billion.</a></p>



<p>Who does this affect: Only “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more will be affected.</p>



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">CFPB</a>) found that applying these rules to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more covers:</p>



 
 80% of consumer deposits 



 68% of overdraft charges 
 



<p>While smaller FIs won’t be directly affected by this rule, it is crucial to stay vigilant to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reactions:</p>



 
 The banking industry is gearing up to fight back with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banking-overdraft-junk-fees-cfpb-jpmorgan-3842af05c0197cba396a9552eb4b099c">multimillion-dollar marketing</a> and lobbying campaign. 



 Banks will need to start implementing new products or campaigns to make up for the revenue loss such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/">cyber safety</a>, secure ID verification, safe browsing, and other privacy tools. (We’ll cover more on that below 👀) 
 



 Dive Deeper 



<p>The financial landscape is on the brink of change. The new rules will reshape revenue streams for banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Overdraft lending: “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule”</p>



<p>The “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule” is part of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order</a> that “Established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.” This order’s initiatives create change across multiple industries, including health care, finance, technology, and more.</p>



<p>The Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule:</p>



 
 Was presented by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 



 Wants FIs to use overdraft fees to break even by either:  FIs calculate their own costs and losses using standards outlined in the proposal.  
 
 Using the benchmark overdraft fees of $3, $6, $7, or $14. 
 
 



 Only applies to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more. 



 Change Regulation Z to expand on the definition of open-end credit: “plan” and “finance charge.” 
 



<p><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">👀 You can read the full document from the CFPB here.</a></p>



<p>Other changes for the financial space from the executive order have included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Assessing-the-Impact-of-New-Entrant-Nonbank-Firms.pdf">The U.S. Department of the Treasury submitted a report</a> to the White House Council to show that fintech needs more regulations.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/">The CFPB proposed a new rule to lower credit card late fees.</a> 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/why-were-modernizing-how-we-collect-credit-card-data/">The CFPB is making credit card comparison more accessible.</a> 
 



<p>For all banks and credit unions, these new rules can have significant impact. The CFPB is setting new standards in the FI industry, which consumers will come to expect from all FIs, no matter the size.</p>



 The Overdraft Fee Changes: Making New Revenue Streams 



<p>The proposed regulations can significantly reduce overdraft fee revenue, prompting banks and credit unions to seek alternative revenue sources. While this presents a challenge, it also creates opportunities for proactive innovation and the maintenance of financial well-being.</p>

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Japan is&nbsp;US$3000.  It has been in effect in the country since June&nbsp;2023.  During its evaluation, the FATF praised Japan’s anti-money laundering efforts and called them effective while also noting areas for potential improvement.  <p>Japan was among the first countries to recognize the potential of the decentralized crypto ecosystem and took significant measures to position itself as the world’s crypto hub. One of the measures Japan took included the introduction of various crypto-related regulations, such as the FATF Travel Rule, aimed at preventing malicious entities from exploiting digital assets for illicit activities, including terrorist financing and money laundering.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan <p>Japan legally recognized cryptocurrencies in 2016 and further solidified their status by amending the Payment Services Act in 2019 to treat crypto assets as legal property. It led to the establishment of clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, including the need for strict anti-money laundering measures.</p><p>The country later introduced the Crypto Travel Rule in 2022, requiring exchanges to share transaction data to combat money laundering. FATF Travel Rule, however, did not become active in 2022 and instead <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">came into force in June&nbsp;2023</a>.</p><p>The current threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule applies to a crypto transaction in Japan is $3000. This means VASPS must transmit the required information only if the amount exceeds this&nbsp;limit.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Compliance Requirements <p>In line with FATF’s Recommendations, beneficiary and originator VASPs in Japan must obtain, hold, and make available on request to appropriate authorities the following information:</p><p>- Name and account number of the originator</p><p>- Place and date of birth of originator as well as address or national identity number, customer identification number</p><p>- Name and account number of the beneficiary</p><p>The information makes it possible for authorities to track the transaction routes of crypto assets and stablecoins.</p><p>Virtual Asset Service Providers, according to Japan’s financial regulation PSA, are those that are involved&nbsp;in:</p><p>- Purchase, sale, and exchange of crypto&nbsp;assets</p><p>- Intermediating, brokering, or acting as an agent for the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing customer’s money in connection with all the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing crypto assets for the benefit of another&nbsp;person</p><p>Now, a recent development seeks to refine this regulatory framework further, with <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/newsletter/weekly2024/573.html">the FSA proposing</a> to simplify the Crypto Travel Rule on January 26th this year. The new draft requires VASPs to report restricted crypto-assets to a certified payment service association and publicly disclose this information. The agency is currently receiving public comments on the proposal until February 26th,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Japan’s self-regulated crypto organization, JVCEA, also noted in its “2024 New Year’s Thoughts” <a href="https://jvcea.or.jp/news/main-info/20240101-001/">notice</a> that by revising the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) to implement the FATF Travel Rule, it has become the “first major developed country to do&nbsp;so.”</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Japan, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the FSA, which is responsible for overseeing banking, securities, and exchange sectors. Meanwhile, the Payment Services Act has been applied to all crypto exchanges operating in Japan since April&nbsp;2017.</p><p>Moreover, through amendments to its Payment Services Act, Japan already requires exchanges to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering (ML) measures. Under this, crypto exchanges need to provide customer due diligence procedures, maintain records, ensure customer assets are secure, and improve their security.</p><p>Now, with the Crypto Travel Rule in place, it further tightens these regulations for crypto exchanges in Japan, as they now have to assess the money laundering and financial terrorism risks for self-hosted wallets as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The APTCP also plans to update its rules, requiring VASPs to collect sender and receiver information for transactions involving self-hosted wallets or unregistered VASPs, including when these transactions occur in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule is not yet enforced.</p><p>Although Japan does not mandate covering transactions with counterparties in locations that haven’t yet implemented the Travel Rule regulations, VASPs must still evaluate the risks and gather necessary information. To aid this process, the FSA regularly updates its list of countries that meet Japan’s Travel Rule standards.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Global Context and Comparisons <p>Japan’s Travel Rule sets a US$3,000 threshold for cryptocurrency transactions, higher than Singapore’s SGD 1,500 and Canada’s CAD 1,000, and unlike many countries that have no threshold. This stringent threshold is part of Japan’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing strategy, which <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/countries/detail/Japan.html">the FATF has deemed effective</a> while also highlighting areas that could benefit from further improvements.</p><p>Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">PWC’s report</a>, Japan is among the only 23 countries that were engaged in advancing crypto-focused regulations and legislation in 2023 across all four key focus areas: Travel Rule compliance, stablecoin regulation, licensing and listing guidance, and crypto framework development.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In conclusion, Japan’s adherence to clear guidelines for crypto companies and global anti-money laundering standards, exemplified by initiatives like the Crypto Travel Rule, reinforces its standing in the crypto industry amid heightened global regulatory scrutiny.</p> Relevant Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Comprehensive Guide to Crypto Regulations and FATF Travel Rule in Singapore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Back in March of 1950, the FBI added Willie “The Actor” Sutton to their list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. During his tenure as an American bank robber, Sutton stole an estimated $2 million ($25 million in today’s dollars) and was known for using disguises. Police officer, maintenance worker, postal carrier, and telegraph messenger were a few of the roles the fraudster assumed to execute his heists.</p>
<p>When asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “because that’s where the money is.”</p>
<p>For a modern Willie Sutton, real estate seller impersonation might be considered the latest fraud method of choice. Fraudsters are focusing on compromising the identity of property owners to sell real estate they do not own. Their goal is to collect the funds a buyer intends to use for purchasing the property before other transaction participants realize the fraudster is not the legal owner.</p>
<p>Imagine owning a piece of land where you haven’t built anything yet, and one day as you drive past it you discover that there is a construction site on it. As you finally get to speak with the person in charge of the construction, you hear them claiming they rightfully own the land, with a perfectly valid deed of sale as proof.</p>
<p>How is this even possible in 2024, you may wonder? It’s simple: With the explosion of online business transactions over the last five years, technology has made it easy to buy and sell remotely – but not necessarily easy to do it securely.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for a bad actor to find leaked data online, and to spot weak identity verification methods in a remote real estate sales process. Personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to real estate owners, loan applicants, sellers, and real estate agents is valuable to bad actors looking to commit seller impersonation fraud.</p>
<p>Seller impersonation fraud follows a specific methodology, and understanding the nuances is critical in safeguarding your organization. Our latest white paper provides more details about how it happens, the challenges it creates, and best practices you can put in place to prevent these risks without negatively impacting your sales processes.</p>

<p>Biometric spoofing, also known as biometric spoof attacks or biometric presentation attacks, refers to the manipulation or falsification of biometric data to deceive a biometric authentication system.</p>
 What Is Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive:</p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking. 
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user. 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition system</a>. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information). 
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake. 
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence. 
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface.</p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data.</p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In Blogs 1–3 of this series we have been exploring the conceptual aspects of an alternative monetary system. In this final blog, we would like to shift gear and channel our thinking into a series of practical next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;four:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (B<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">log&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?  <p>Whilst writing this post, we began to feel a niggling sense of doubt. Something about it felt quite anticlimactic. In this initiative we started with a bold vision underpinned by some detailed research of the problem space. Now, as is so often the case we are grappling with the details of how to make things happen on the ground. In the messy reality of managing relationships, roles, time constraints and funding pressures, our suggestions for a way forward seem insubstantial. Rather than trying to pad them out or use technical language to shield the lack of clarity, we have decided to go ahead and share where we actually are, both in our thinking and in our aspiration for this&nbsp;work.</p> Questions we need to begin working&nbsp;on <p>We are publishing this Blog at an early stage of our thinking. At this point our ambitions far outweigh our intellectual ability and team capacity. This is overwhelming, exciting and humbling! To break through this paralysis we are sharing some open questions based on our initial internal brainstorming sessions and responses to the previous blogs (credited below). If you have reflections or questions of your own then then we would really welcome comments:</p>  What would a low tech, minimum viable proof of possibility look&nbsp;like?  How can we use existing technology meaningfully in different contexts (for example a rural area in the Global&nbsp;South)?¹  How can we account for different closed loop systems in their own rights without going down the data rabbit&nbsp;hole?  Can we build on the energy and intelligence of the Geospatial Community to leverage data in a richly contextual yet feasible&nbsp;format?²  How can we ensure that the idea of a Bioregion doesn’t perpetuate a fractured worldview?  How do we decide which cycles or measurements are the most important for a&nbsp;region?  What are we pegging a system’s health against? How can we estimate what the optimal regenerative potential might&nbsp;be?  What can people do with the individual tokens that they receive? Why would anyone want to take part in a&nbsp;project?  How will the main RegenCoins be exchanged both within and outside of the&nbsp;region?  What can we learn from previous attempts to implement local currencies such as those pioneered by the Transition Town Network?³  How can we make sure that the ability for different people to earn tokens is fair? For example, if somebody lives close to a river it might be easier to demonstrate acts of care than for somebody who lives further&nbsp;away.   Existing technology, tools and research that we can build&nbsp;on <p>We are both sure (and hugely relieved) that we are far from the first people to explore this subject. Many of the ideas outlined in the previous blogs have been inspired by the work of others, and we will continue to learn and incorporate as many diverse perspectives as possible. As we move towards our first prototype we have identified a number of initiatives that we think will provide invaluable insights:</p>  Using market based credit platforms as a basis for quantifying living systems: the level of data being collected is already significant. For example the<a href="https://seed-index.com/"> Seed Biocomplexity Index</a> has been developed to link geospatial satellite data with scientific literature. Another example is the <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> which describes itself as ‘a platform to originate and invest in high-integrity carbon and biodiversity credits from ecological regeneration projects’. Although we are categorically not looking to price elements of the bioregion, the research underpinning some of the Network’s projects (e.g. pollinator health) could be a powerful learning framework. We are also interested to learn from less established initiatives such as land trust tokens being linked to river basin resilience programmes in South&nbsp;Africa¹.  Taxes pegged to positive activities: we hope to learn from proposals for tax incentive schemes that are specifically designed to encourage stewardship activities. An example is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4524897">Malta Atlantica Restoration Currency</a> that is being proposed in&nbsp;Brazil.  Universal basic income / services pilots: there are a number of live and closed UBI/S pilots that we are intrigued to learn from. Of particular interest is to try to understand how people’s behaviour and perception of value is affected, when the link between monetary transactions and daily activities is less&nbsp;linear.³  Statistical forecasting models used in decision making: there is an exciting body of research emerging in the context of applying <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1128055/full">Bayesian forecasting techniques to environmental modelling</a>. We are imagining that this might link closely to crypto economic research currently being conducted at hubs such as WU Vienna and ETH Zurich⁴. Partnering with an academic centre to bring their research into our prototype will be a priority.  Relational, flow based technology: the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/">Holochain Community</a> has developed a number of different peer-to-peer tools and resources that have strong value alignment with this proposal. In particular, the <a href="https://hrea.io/">hREA value flows specification</a> could provide a scaffold to connect the different activities that we would like to&nbsp;explore.  Currency and token design: community experts such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artbrock/">Arthur Brock</a> and <a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/">Grace Rachmany</a> have deep knowledge and experience with alternative currency design. We would aim to consult and build on this expertise rather than trying to reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.  Thrutopia storytelling: the novelist and podcast host Manda Scott describes <a href="https://thrutopia.life/">Thrutopias</a> as ‘clear, engaging routes through to a world we’d all be proud to bequeath to future generations’. As we strive to test pathways in the present, we do not want to lose touch with the imaginative potential that we started to engage with in Blog 3. Prominent authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson⁵ and Yanis Varoufakis⁶ have explored ideas such as a carbon coin and free PerCap accounts within sci-fi narratives, and we will seek to engage with emerging writing in this&nbsp;field.⁷   A prototype proposition <p>As an initial call to action, we would like to partner with a community (or a number of communities) to build the foundations for the world’s first decentralised, bioregional bank. To make the project realistic we imagine that the areas involved will need to be small enough to make the data capture manageable. However they will also need to represent a number of different biophysical and social cycles to ensure a meaningful entangled value interaction is captured. It will also be important to engage with a supportive governance and legal environment for some stages of the work, to ground the prototype in the reality of the existing&nbsp;system.</p><p>We would invite interested communities and collaborators to self-select as high levels of trust and value alignment will be fundamental pillars of success. We will therefore be circulating these blogs and having conversations with a number of potential demonstrator locations. It feels important to clearly state that we do not have the financial resources at this point to pay people for their help. This is difficult and at times feels uncomfortable; the fear is that we may unwittingly perpetuate extractive behaviour in the pursuit of a regenerative goal. We are trying to balance our commitment to push this thinking forward, with a deep sense of respect for our ecosystem and will continually review the relationship between the two for signs of&nbsp;stress.</p>Credit: Eunji Kang, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs<p>The prototype will be designed as 7 interlinked stages:</p>  Value mapping: here we will select a number of elements to visualise. The mix will depend on the location but could include a combination of air and water quality, soil health, biodiversity resilience, equity, care and trust. The mapping is likely to combine geospatial data with interviews, surveys and participatory workshops.  Real time sensory data gathering: based on the value mapping we will investigate the best ways of capturing the relational flows that define our selected elements. For some flows, sensors will already be in place whilst for others the process will be participatory.  Multivalent currency design and use: once we have an understanding of how value is being both created and eroded in our ecosystem, we will attempt to design self-regulating currencies to represent these multivalent flows.  Building a probabilistic model based on data inputs: this stage will combine the data and knowledge gained to simulate how the different elements are impacting on each other. The model will be interactive and infer each forecast from an updated understanding of the underlying systems.  Linking the model to governance decisions: this phase will focus on the interaction between the living agents and the value simulation. It will involve using the model to process multiple data inputs to inform a number of decisions. The outputs will be tested with the community to assess how accurately their views and values are being represented.  Creating a feedback loop between decisions and currency levels: as the system becomes more refined, the collective decisions can be used to adjust the currency levels of the base elements.  Grounding the results in regulatory or policy instruments: we will strive to link the multi-sensory decision making capabilities that have been co-developed with the community, to real world impacts. We hope that this might be achieved by testing a cross boundary tax payable in one (or a blend) of the new currencies. Another idea is to link the currencies to specific policy issues to elevate the agency and collective voice of the community. This second point has a strong link to the work that we have been prototyping in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view?usp=sharing">Sweden</a>, Scotland and Canada to create multi-sensory, living indicators.  <p>We don’t know the exact details of how the above will be achieved but we are confident that the collective knowledge and tools are already available. The steps need not be taken consecutively and we imagine that different elements can be worked on across multiple contexts and time frames. A big part of this journey will be connecting people, ideas and technologies to work towards this common goal.

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>
<p>Schools can <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-revolutionizes-adoption-of-open-badges/">issue credential-based diplomas</a> that allow students to share them without the need to reach back out to the school for verification; businesses can use them for both <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-works-verifiable-credentials-for-frictionless-secure-employee-identification/">employee access management</a> and customer loyalty programs; countries can allow their citizens to share their resident status for all kinds of things from <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">travel</a> to paying bills to <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-identity-and-the-public-sector-using-verifiable-credentials-to-manage-social-security/">proving residency</a>.</p>
<p>In short, once you’ve met your initial identity assurance requirements, verifiable credentials can eliminate redundant paperwork and data input, and provide a simpler, streamlined, better customer experience.</p>
<p>And the Proven Mobile SDK provides all the pieces you need. In a fraction of the time. On any application. In whatever language your team is familiar with.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn how to get started you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">read more about the Proven Mobile SDK</a>, or <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to our team.</a></p>

 What is Customer Authentication? 



<p>Customer authentication is a critical security process that identifies and verifies users before allowing them access to digital accounts. It’s built on login credentials established during user onboarding, utilizing a blend of knowledge-based (passwords), possession-based (security tokens), and inherence-based (biometrics) authenticators. The adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become standard practice, requiring users to provide multiple identity proofs to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.</p>



<p>This security measure is essential for protecting against common threats like account takeover attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Despite the prevalence of password-based systems, their effectiveness is compromised by common security pitfalls, such as the reuse of passwords. Therefore, more advanced authentication methods, including MFA and adaptive authentication, are increasingly important. These methods assess risk levels and adjust security measures dynamically, improving the security posture without compromising user experience. New technologies like FIDO2 passkeys and biometric authentication pave the way toward more secure, passwordless authentication methods, emphasizing ease of use and improved security.</p>



<p>Customer authentication is a crucial building block gatekeeper for user data and access in digital security. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, customer authentication methods have also undergone significant advancements, aiming to strike a balance between robust security and user-friendliness. This balance helps to ensure that authorized users can easily access the digital world while maintaining the highest level of security measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

 System to achieve full compliance of Crypto Asset Service Providers and self-hosted wallets with AML regulations and the Transfer of Funds Regulation&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>



<p>“Bloom is excited to be collaborating with the partners in this consortium. This project will ensure our users and the crypto ecosystem can benefit from a self-hosted wallet that complies with EU regulations,” says Nicole O’Brien, Co-founder of Bloom Labs.</p>



<p>“We’re proud to be part of this groundbreaking consortium, leveraging SPYCE.5’s hybrid chain architecture to navigate the complex landscape of EU regulations. Our innovative approach ensures not only compliance but also maintains the integrity and efficiency vital in the crypto space,” says Holger Köther, Managing Director of SPYCE.5.</p>

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is rightly considered a security upgrade on single-factor approaches like a simple username and password. MFA does a great job of reinforcing traditional login credentials, and in turn, is very effective at stopping fraudsters who take advantage of easy prey – such as the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">12% of consumers</a> who use one single password for every account across multiple platforms. In situations like these, where fraudsters rely solely on stolen credentials to perpetrate their crimes, MFA methods like SMS and email OTPs are very effective at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/account-takeover-ato-fraud.html">preventing account takeover (ATO)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether. All of this means that, while MFA is a great way to reinforce login credentials like usernames and passwords, it may not be enough to stop the latest types of ATO.</p>

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions. By adopting these measures, organizations can further protect their critical systems and their existing IdP.</p>
<p>In addition to the above steps, organizations with on-premises environments can also secure their IdP with the use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/why-use-an-hsm">hardware security modules (HSM)</a> that provide enhanced security for securely storing keys, secrets, and tokens.</p>
