<p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/denys-popov-1623a614a/">Denys&nbsp;Popov</a></p><p>SSI adoption has many layers of challenges and complexities. One of the problems that I want to address in this article&nbsp;is,</p><p>“How to have an enterprise <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> when an employee 👨‍💼👩‍💼 can act on behalf of this company 🏢 with flexible permissions layer in a decentralized or peer-to-peer way?”</p><p>There are several hack solutions for this, but all of them have at least one major problem, which limits the usage and implementation of existing solutions.</p><p>Before we go into my proposed solution, let’s look at the problem&nbsp;first.</p> Problem Statement <p>Let’s say an organization wants to issue power of attorney as a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable</a> <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Credential (VC)</a> for an employee&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Such an issuance requires a custom method for VC verification, so there should be a custom flow. Here, the employee should pass any meaningful info/VC to prove his organization’s power of attorney VC, and the verifier must perform that extra check of authority VC.</p><p>This verification may not be as easy as it sounds because the verifier must know how to handle&nbsp;that.</p> Workflow <p>Here’s the workflow of the above&nbsp;problem.</p>  The founder/CEO/creator of the organization DID can add to the DID document public keys (with proper authority/access/entry points) of employees.  Next, an employee can use his personal DID to issue a document/VC on behalf of the organization and set it to an issuer field organization DID before sharing it with the verifier.  The verifier will <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers">resolve</a> the Issuer DID (in this case, it’s the organization’s DID). To do this, the verifier will get the issuing organization’s DID Document, find the proper employee public key, and verify the signature.  <p>Looks good so&nbsp;far.</p><p>However, we have a problem here. The founder, who created the organization DID, will have full control and access to the anchor/recovery key. Therefore, they can always update the organization’s DID document, and no CEO/Founder rotation is possible&nbsp;here.</p><p>Though some existing solutions include modifications to the DID document to have several controllers, they won’t solve the issue altogether.</p> Proposed solution <p>Here’s my solution to support the majority of DID methods without modifications/custom flows and simultaneously have the flexibility you&nbsp;need.</p>  Create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAO</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contract.</a> In the initialize phase, define a set of stakeholders (their crypto addresses/DIDs) and define a threshold number required to get the consensus/perform action (should be equal to or smaller than the number of stakeholders), and initially perform the anchoring of DID by this smart contract on initialization.  Next, the smart contract (kind of DAO) interface should allow for the threshold number from that group of stakeholders to make a decision (change the smart contract&nbsp;state):  <p>- Update the related DID Document (by adding/removing public keys of employees or some permissions of&nbsp;it)</p><p>- Change the threshold number for making future decisions</p><p>- Add/remove stakeholders</p><p>With this solution, an organization’s authorized employee can sign documents using their personal keys, but can mark the Issuer as organization DID. Then, the verifier will perform just the standard verification, and it will&nbsp;work.</p><p>At any point, the stakeholders can remove an employee’s public key from an organization or change those permissions. Also, stakeholders can be changed when the required consensus is met. All this interaction is done and available in a decentralized way.</p><p>What do you think of this solution?</p><p>Join our community today</p>  Get conversations going with #teamaffinidi and the community on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>  Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>  Get the latest updates on what’s new at Affinidi; join<a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v"> our mailing&nbsp;list</a>  Interested in <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/careers">joining our&nbsp;team</a>?

			<p>7th October 2022, Luxembourg – <a href="https://assetera.com/">Assetera</a>, the first EU-regulated trading platform for digital securities and digital assets, licensed and supervised by the Austrian FMA, partners with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization solutions provider. With this partnership, Assetera will become a liquidity venue compatible with <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino/">DINO</a>, the global distribution network for tokenized private assets, leveraging the ERC3643 protocol, to provide European investors with diversified global assets and facilitate liquidity.</p>

		 
	 
    Mathieu Cottin, Chief of Operations at Tokeny (On the left), with Thomas Labenbacher, CEO of Assetera (On the right) announced the partnership at Munich Security Token Conference (MSTC.live)        We’ve been closely following the market, and it is clear that ERC3643 is becoming a proven token standard for digital securities. We see the huge opportunities in interoperability the ERC3643 standard brings, allowing the creation of a global distribution network and innovative DeFi use cases such as collateralization.  Thomas LabenbacherCEO of Assetera    
	 
		 
			<p>In addition, the partnership with Tokeny will also allow its customers to have a one-stop shop from tokenizing assets to listing digital securities for secondary trading in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
   As a regulated trading platform, we want to make sure that our customers, being issuers, market makers, or investors, can use a compliance framework for tokenization, primary and secondary market trading, and custody. Partnering with Tokeny will enable us to list more interesting digital securities, and connect our liquidity pools with others from the DINO distribution network.  Thomas LabenbacherCEO of Assetera    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny is known for its enterprise-grade tokenization solutions to allow banks, funds, asset managers, and asset servicers to easily issue, manage and transfer digital securities or stablecoins using the ERC3643 token standard. Additionally, it serves as a technology enabler for service providers seeking to participate in the ERC3643 ecosystem.</p>

		 
	 
   The adoption of tokenized securities was slow in Europe because of the lack of trading venues. Our partner Assetera is tackling this issue with a unique model for trading securities, leveraging blockchain networks for onchain settlement in a peer-to-peer manner. Together with builders like Assetera, we are making private markets more liquid, interoperable, and efficient.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny      
	 
		 
			 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny provides a compliance infrastructure for digital assets. It allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly and seamlessly issue, transfer, and manage securities using distributed ledger technology. By applying trust, compliance, and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the management and liquidity of financial instruments. The company is backed by strategic investors such as Euronext, Inveniam, and Apex Group.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 About Assetera 
<p>Assetera is the first regulated trading platform in the EU for digital securities and digital assets, targeting institutional and retail investors. Assetera is licensed and supervised by the Austrian FMA, making Assetera your trustworthy partner in the new area of asset tokenization, primary market and secondary market trading, management and custody.

<p>That’s right, Holochain has hit another milestone on its <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap">roadmap</a>. I’m excited about this one, because it completes a feature that many application design patterns require: cell cloning. This feature lets an application make copies of a DNA, keeping its functionality but creating a new network. Some or all app users can then join that cloned network.

(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1578">#1578</a>)</p><p>Clones are automatically given role IDs consisting of the original’s role ID plus the suffix <code>.0</code>, <code>.1</code>, <code>.2</code>, and so forth. Because not everyone using an app will be joining the same cloned DHTs or in the same order, these numbers are local to the user and shouldn’t be expected to correspond to the same cloned DNAs across all users. Instead, clones ought to be identified by the clone’s DNA hash, which will be affected by the DNA modifiers passed in when the clone was created.</p><p>What’s the difference between archiving a cell and deleting it, and why do you have to use two separate APIs to finish the job? Well, an app should have the power to retire cloned cells as needed (think of a temporary workspace), but in order to protect the user from data loss it shouldn’t have the power to delete those cells’ data, either through software bugs or malice. The admin API endpoints that let a user restore or permanently delete cells will generally be available through the UI of the software controlling the conductor — the Holochain Launcher, for instance.</p><p>Breaking: The term ‘DNA modifiers’ is a new one for this release. It describes the network seed, properties, and origin time — everything that affects a DNA’s hash without affecting its running code. (Theoretically, properties can affect the way the DNA behaves, but only in the same way that environment variables affect a shell script.)</p><p>As a result of the above work, these modifiers are now bundled together in one <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/prelude/struct.DnaModifiers.html"><code>DnaModifiers</code></a> structure wherever you interact with them. All fields are still optional (except for <code>origin_time</code>, which I’ll get to below), but the field <code>modifiers</code> is required because you have to supply a value for at least one field in order to actually modify the DNA. Here’s where you might see this struct:</p>  DNA manifests  The admin API endpoints <code>RegisterDna</code> and <code>InstallAppBundle</code>  The app API endpoint <code>CreateCloneCell</code>  <p>Breaking: The <code>origin_time</code> field in your DNA manifest, now part of the `modifiers` struct, is now required. This field is still optional for the admin API endpoints that install DNAs or clone cells, as they will default the DNA manifest.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220928014801">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.165: Relaxed RegisterDnaPayload call <p>Release date: 30 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2, 0.1.3<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152, 0.0.153, 0.0.154<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>This release contains only one small change: When calling <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.59/holochain_types/app/struct.RegisterDnaPayload.html"><code>RegisterDnaPayload</code></a> via the admin API, the entire DNA modifiers struct can be omitted if you have no modifiers to give.

The only consequences for you is that users of your hApp won’t be able to use both this conductor and previous conductors in the same DHT, and you may have to add or remove a few <code>.into()</code>s and change your use of <code>AnyDhtHash</code> to <code>AnyLinkableHash</code> if you’re using <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/#external-links">baseless links</a> in your zome code. Note that this doesn’t break host API compatibility; you can still mix and match zomes and conductors in this compatibility series. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1601">#1601</a>)  Breaking (Rust test utilities): There have been some small changes to helpers for creating inline zomes in our Rust-based test utilities. This is unlikely to affect you, even if you have been using Sweettest to write your zome tests.

Client release notes  JavaScript client 0.9.0 - 0.9.2: cell cloning <p>I’m rolling these three releases into one, because 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 are just bug fixes. These releases bring support for the conductor’s new cell cloning features by exposing <code>createCloneCell</code>, <code>restoreCloneCell</code>, and <code>deleteArchivedCloneCells</code>.

<p>In my last blog I looked into the high level role of the Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) and the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101-issuance-and-wallets/" title="wallet technology required to ‘hold’ credentials">wallet technology required to ‘hold’ credentials</a>. In this blog I want to look at the issuance process, how do you get an LE-vLEI or an OOR-vLEI or ECR-vLEI credential, but before we dive into that, we need to talk a little about the wider eco-system and the governance framework.</p>
 vLEI Governance Framework 
  
<p>The vLEI eco-system provides both organisations and individual identities to a defined level of assurance. It also provides linkage information, also at a defined level of assurance. These identities and the linkage between them have the potential to provide significant benefit to organisations and the processes they run. The <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Katso-Case-Study.pdf" title="Finnish Government Katso&nbsp;case study">Finnish Government Katso&nbsp;case study</a> published by Ubisecure details the value that can be achieved by linking strong individual and organisation identities .</p>
<p>It is important that the identities and the linkage are determined in a defined way. This definition, or framework, generates the trust in the claims that are provided regarding the identities and the linkage. Each identity eco-system will have a definition of the level of assurance and authentication required and it is this definition that allows a level of trust to be applied. The vLEI eco-system is no different.</p>
<p>The GLEIF have made significant investments into building the governance framework for the vLEI ecosystem. It is this framework that directly gives value to the credentials as third parties can rely on the claims contained within (to the level defined in the governance framework).</p>
<p>You can find all the details of the framework on the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">GLEIF site</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the framework is at version 0.9, and not yet final, however it is sufficiently developed that issuance processes are well understood. We do expect changes to the framework in the coming months – for example in the last blog I said that the GLEIF were providing the wallets and issuance software for QVIs to use, it is now likely that QVIs will have to build their own ‘wallet’ and issuance software.</p>
 Identity assurance levels 
<p>The vLEI eco-system governance framework defines the assurance levels as follows:</p>



Organisation
valid, active LEI contained within the GLEIS


Individual
NIST IAL2


Linkage
Official public data source (for example business registry)



<p>The organisation assurance uses the work of LOUs in verifying legal entities as part of the LEI issuance. For the individual identity, NIST-IAL2 requires verification against an official identity document (for example a passport) that can be in-person or remote. The linkage between the individual and the organisation must be evidenced by official public data – such as a director listing in a business registry.</p>
 But how do I get a vLEI for my company? 
<p>The issuance process is a reflection of the assurance levels required and good practise in key management / usage. Let’s walk through what is needed to obtain an LE-vLEI, it is a little involved so grab a coffee then we can proceed.</p>
 Setting up the Representatives for the Legal Entity 
<p>The first step in issuance is for a representative to enter a contractual agreement with a QVI to provide the issuance service. The individual from the legal entity that undertakes this contractual signup is known as the Designated Authorised Representative (DAR). The DAR is responsible for contractual signup and the introduction of individuals who will manage the LE-vLEI for the company.</p>
<p>Once the contract is in place, the DAR will provide details of 3 Legal Entity Authorised Representatives (LARs). There can be more or less than three, but the Governance Framework looks for three as the (minimum) ideal. The LARs will between them control the issued LE-vLEI and be required to participate in further usage of the LE-vLEI. They jointly control the signing ability of the LE-vLEI.</p>
<p>Each LAR must have their personal identity assured to a NIST-IAL2 level, and the QVI will have its own defined process for undertaking this. Each LAR will also need a wallet to store their unique identifier and associated signing keys. One of the LARs will be designated as the Lead LAR and responsible for leading the issuance from the LE side.</p>
<p>The individual identity verification process might require a video call, however that is dependent upon the verification process used by the QVI.</p>
 Issuing the Credential for the Entity, the LE-vLEI 
<p>The issuance process will require a video call and will require the LARs to be present on the call.</p>
<p>From the QVI perspective there will be at least two QVI Authorised Representatives (QARs) involved, a lead and a secondary.</p>
<p>At the start of the issuance call the QARs will ensure that the LEI for the LE is active and is correct for the Legal Entity involved. The QARs must also ensure that the LARs present are the same individuals as have been assured previously. This can be via technical means or via the LARs representing their identification documents on the video call.</p>
<p>Once the LARs have been verified, they must each provide the ‘address’ of their wallets. This happens through sharing a URL known as the Out of Band Introduction (OOBI). The QARs must also share the OOBI for the QVI’s credential.</p>
<p>Each LAR will have a unique ID (AID) held in their wallet. Each LAR must prove that they are in control of the AID by responding to a challenge request. The challenge request is provided by the lead QAR for the LARs and by the lead LAR for the QVI’s credential.</p>
<p>Once control has been proved the Lead QAR can now initiate the LE-vLEI process by capturing the LE details. The details are then wrapped into an LE-vLEI credential which then must be signed by both of the QARs. At this stage a valid LE-vLEI credential will exist and using the OOBI, will be transferred to the LARs wallets.</p>
<p>The LARs are now able to view the new LE-vLEI credential and use it to perform actions that require ‘signing’ by the LE.</p>
<p>Please note that the above description is simplified. The full LE-vLEI issuance process is detailed in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-02-07_legal-entity-vlei-credential-gf-draft-publication_v0.9-draft.pdf">Ecosystem Governance Framework vLEI Credential Governance Framework Legal Entity Official Organizational Role</a>. Also note that in the current documents LARs are referred to as AVRs but this will change in the next release.</p>
 Issuing Individual Credentials, OOR-vLEIs and ECR-vLEIs 
 The chain of trust 
<p></p>
<p>Once the Legal Entity has a LE-vLEI it is possible for Official Organisation Roles (OOR) or Engagement Context Roles (ECR) to be issued. The current Governance Framework does not provide a technical linkage between the LE-vLEI and the &nbsp;OOR-vLEIs however a change will shortly be made that requires the LARs to create a credential request credential that is passed to a QVI. The QVI will then use the request credential to issue the OOR or ECR and the system will ensure chaining between the LE-vLEI and the OOR-vLEIs / ECR-vLEIs.</p>
<p>The data subject for the OOR / ECR must be introduced to the QVI by the DAR or a LAR. The individual will go through identity assurance to a NIST-IAL2 level as per the LARs. If an OOR is being issued then the QAR must be able to locate an official public data source that confirms the official role being requested (there is a caveat here for OORs that cannot be proved externally, typically due to timing issues – for example a new company director, it is possible for multiple LARs to vouch for the linkage).</p>
<p>Each credential subject will require a wallet and must have a unique ID created along with the associated signing key pair. This will happen before the issuance process takes place.</p>
<p>As per the LE-vLEI issuance a video call will be required to issue an OOR, the data subject must be verified as must the LARs present on the call. Again, OOBIs must be exchanged and proof of control of the unique IDs must take place.</p>
<p>The QAR ensures that the official role requested exists in the published list of official roles and then proceeds with the issuance.</p>
<p>For ECRs it is permissible for the LE itself to issue the credential, or they can return to a QVI to have the QVI issue the credential. Also note that there is no requirement that the QVI used to issue the LE-vLEI is the same as the QVI used to issue OOR-vLEIs credentials.</p>
<p>As per the LE-vLEI description the above is simplified. The full OOR-vLEIs issuance process is detailed in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-02-07_legal-entity-vlei-credential-gf-draft-publication_v0.9-draft.pdf">Ecosystem Governance Framework vLEI Credential Governance Framework Legal Entity Official Organizational Role</a>. Also note that in the current documents LARs are referred to as AVRs but this will change in the next release.</p>
 And Finally 
<p>I hope the coffee was good. One last item to point out is that the entire framework utilises the feature and capabilities of the <a href="https://keri.one/keri-resources/">KERI</a> platform. Our Principal Scientist has been writing about KERI, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials-understanding-key-principles/" title="Verifiable Credentials – how does it work?

<p>It’s that time of year again! The time to celebrate the work that pushes our industry forward. We’re proud to announce this year’s Identity Excellence Awards winners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t stress enough how great the work that’s been submitted this year has been. Reviewing all the nominations and seeing all the ways our customers are continuing to innovate in the field is both exciting and inspiring. It’s no wonder that it was harder than ever for our judging committee to pick just one winner for each award. Though all of this year’s nominees are doing something special for the industry, our winners have truly made an impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year we celebrated the award recipients at the Austin stop of our global user conference, PingYOUniverse. We were happy to sing our praises for all these deserving companies and I was delighted to congratulate each one of our winners in person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, it’s my privilege to announce the 2022 Identity Excellence Awards winners as follows:</p>

  <p>Recent high-profile software supply chain attacks have highlighted the importance of security in the DevOps environment. But this can be challenging because DevOps teams are at the forefront of digital transformation and use agile techniques to deliver applications quickly, often not following traditional paths of identity management.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and GitGuardian as they discuss security vulnerabilities in DevOps environments, which are often due to a lack of visibility and control of widely distributed secrets such as API keys, database passwords, cloud access keys, certificates, SSH keys, and service account passwords, leaving millions of credentials exposed.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will discuss the challenges and importance of managing secrets in DevOps environments, which increasingly include the use of multi-cloud, workload containerization, and infrastructure-as-code. He will also explain how the business advantages and security of DevOps can be improved.&nbsp;Mackenzie Jackson, Developer Advocate at GitGuardian will explain the issues of secrets sprawl and poor secrets hygiene. He will also discuss in detail a secrets management maturity model developed by GitGuardian, highlight the benefits of automated secrets detection and remediation, and describe how these can be used to infuse security into development workflows.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/devsecops-maturity-model-secrets-management"></a>

At the time of writing this article, she had over 73 million Twitter followers and more than 331 million followers on Instagram.</p><p>Such massive popularity often translates into a fair share of promotional opportunities, including in the crypto space. So, Kardashian, too, received such promotional opportunities for posting about various cryptocurrencies on social media, and one of her posts caught the SEC’s attention.</p><p>Which post are we referring to here? Kardashian’s promotional Instagram post on Ethereum Max tokens in September last year contained a link to the EthereumMax website, which provided instructions on purchasing EMAX&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Ethereum Max reportedly paid Kardashian $250,000 for this post, which she failed to disclose to the SEC, as required under the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2022/33-11116.pdf">regulations</a> that make it mandatory for any person promoting a financial product to disclose the compensation amount, as well as the nature and source of payment to the regulatory body. This is why the SEC filed charges against Kardashian and made her pay penalties.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-white-house-launches-a-comprehensive-framework-for-crypto-assets">The White House Launches a Comprehensive Framework for Crypto&nbsp;Assets</a></p> What did SEC Chair Gary Gensler Say on the&nbsp;Matter? <p>Referring to the SEC’s charges against Kardashian, the SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, “This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors.”</p><a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832">Image Source</a><blockquote>He also tweeted that “any celebrity or influencer’s incentives aren’t necessarily aligned with yours” and that the public shouldn’t confuse the skills of celebrities “with the very different skills needed to offer appropriate investment advice.”</blockquote> Is this the Only Instance of the SEC Barring a Celebrity From Crypto Promotions for Flouting Regulations? <p>No, this is not the first celebrity to be barred for not disclosing compensation for cryptocurrency promotions. The SEC had also barred the American boxer Floyd Mayweather, Hollywood star Steven Seagal, and “DJ Khaled” from promoting crypto assets previously.</p><p>Simply put, the SEC is making a statement of sorts with its action against these celebrities that it will no longer tolerate them breaking the law while promoting what it calls unregistered securities. So, the stars will have to play by the rules, or the SEC will make them face the&nbsp;music.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Transportation has evolved over the years in a variety of ways. But one key factor hasn’t changed—safety. 



<p>Shared mobility is at the forefront of transportation today. With many people having switched to splitting their time between the office and home these days, traveling has become less about individuals and their personal vehicles and more about the most convenient, flexible, cost-efficient and eco-friendly daily transport options for everyone.</p>



<p>This is especially the case when it comes to modern cities and their residents. With a majority of individuals living in larger cities such as London, Berlin, New York City and Dubai, the demand and need for a more convenient, cheap, flexible and environmentally friendly means of transportation is present.</p>



<p>Major cities face obstacles such as population density, high living costs, and just an overall lack of space, especially for personally owned vehicles. In effect, this creates a desire for changing the transportation landscape by having fewer cars, making traveling more efficient, cleaner and more on demand.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/4/2418/htm">72 percent of emissions coming from road transport and 44 percent of that coming from passenger vehicles</a>, shared mobility provides society a more economical, eco-friendly and safer way to travel since more and more people opt out of using personal vehicles and switch to a shared mobility option. This is especially true since car sharing companies are reported to be <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/4/2418/htm">10-20 percent more fuel efficient</a> than the average vehicles.</p>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/how-shared-mobility-will-change-the-automotive-industry">costs are lowered</a> for both operators and passengers due to a lower demand for personal vehicles, gas emissions are lowered, and fatalities and injuries are consequently also lowered through the reduced usage of motor vehicles. Plus, an extra security and safety layer is added for both operators and drivers due to the requirement of driver’s license verification.</p>



<p>And with people being the second principle in the <a href="https://www.sharedmobilityprinciples.org/">shared mobility principles for livable cities</a>, it is important to remember that humans are the ones needing to be transported and vehicles are just the machines that get us there. This means that society—we—are at the front lines of transit where we belong, knowing that by placing mankind at the starting line, safety becomes the number one priority when it comes to the movement of people.</p>



<p>Ultimately, when planning for the transportation of the public, safety becomes the leader directing us into supporting and transforming what we know about mobility.</p>



 Transforming transportation 



<p>With <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/370287?archive=yes">car sharing</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/26/story-cities-amsterdam-bike-share-scheme">bike sharing</a> originating in 1960s Europe, shared mobility is no new concept and continues to see an upward increase. The reason that the future of shared mobility is headed in an upward direction is because it combines all the different possibilities of traveling from A to B, especially in cities.</p>



<p>Such options include ride sharing, ride hailing, car rentals, car financing and the ever-growing micro-mobility sector which includes escooters, bikes and mopeds. The real beauty is that people can use these services at any time and from anywhere. One of the actions that is asked of them is to verify their identity and/or driver’s license (depending on the operator, use case, or regulatory requirements) through a driver’s license verification before using the service. This allows everyone on the roads, whether walking, biking, driving or riding, the safety they deserve.</p>



 Prioritizing people over vehicles 



<p>As services and operators shift their sights to people, the needs and desires of those people must be taken into consideration. This includes offering a variety of choices for individuals <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">from every walk of life and ability</a>, along with giving both the operator and user peace of mind by verifying that those who use such services are legally allowed to do so. This can be achieved through a simple <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver license verification</a> where users simply snap a photo of their driver’s license along with a selfie and the authenticity will be cross-referenced in a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>Through such verification, people become the priority by guaranteeing the safety of all those commuting and travelling to their desired destinations by verifying the driver’s identity, screening out underage drivers and false licenses, and validating special requirements.</p>



 







 Benefits of automated Identity Verification in Shared Mobility 



<p>Not only is shared mobility providing millions of people with the transportation they need in a safe way, but it also allows them the convenience, flexibility and affordability they are looking for all due to automated identity verification.</p>



<p>Before automated ID verification became prominent, people had to physically go to a car rental facility and confirm their identity and driver’s license by filling out forms and presenting their physical driver’s license all before even getting into a vehicle. Being a major hassle, this took time away from getting on the road. Now, thanks to automated driver license verification, there’s no need to waste precious time before traveling. Drivers need only to install the car sharing app and verify their driver’s license and/or identity by taking a quick photo of themselves and their ID document. Customers are on the road in minutes while mobility operators steer clear of any potential fraud.</p>



<p>Thus, it comes as no surprise that convenience is the number one reason people are using shared mobility services <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">according to McKinsey</a>. This includes the smooth and quick onboarding when verifying their identities, along with the availability of services and the flexible travel that personal vehicles do not offer. Operators can therefore expect high conversion rates when such characteristics are met and provided to users.</p>



<p>However, the features customers desire, and in turn benefit from, include safety, coming in as number one, followed by price and availability or reliability. When companies can offer the convenience users are looking for paired with the safety both parties deserve, then everyone will benefit in the end.</p>



 How DL Verification provides the safety everyone needs 



<p>As the fields of shared mobility increase in size to include more and more options, the need for identity verification, specifically driver license verification, becomes a bigger priority.</p>



<p>IDnow and its products such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, provide the security, conveniency and flexibility that operators need and customers want.</p>



<p>A state-of-the-art driver license verification system should be able to run identity verification checks accurately and in real time. Plus, it should be fully complaint with EU regulations. By fulfilling these requirements, users know they can trust the mobility service they are using while getting on the roads faster, and operators have the peace of mind through the validation of their clients’ identities all while being compliant. When both parties are satisfied, conversion rates rise.</p>



<p>With IDnow’s service, mobility businesses can easily integrate their MaaS platform with AutoIdent and customers simply need only to sign up, take a selfie and picture of their driver’s license or ID document and AutoIdent will verify it in seconds so they can be on their way.</p>



<p>Driver license verification comes in handy for all types of shared mobility by providing age verification, special license verification, driver identification while also screening out fraudulent licenses. And not only that, but it can validate driver’s licenses from over 50+ countries around the globe.</p>



<p>With IDnow and AutoIdent, operators and users receive the safety that is needed through identity verification. In the end, no one is left stranded because people and their identities come first.</p>

 The new European standard for identity proofing, electronic signatures and trust services, developed in collaboration with regulatory expertise from the private sector&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, October 6, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading European provider for identity proofing, is&nbsp;one of the first companies to receive the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119461/01.01.01_60/ts_119461v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 461 certification</a>, a new European technical standard for identity proofing for trust services, and especially qualified electronic signatures (QES). This certification enables IDnow to continue to provide compliant identity proofing solutions for trust services and act as&nbsp;Identity Proofing Service Provider (IPSP) for Trust Service Providers (TSP).</p>



<p>Technical standard raises the security level across the industry</p>



<p>The standard was first released in July 2021 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and defines security best practices for different ident methods, including on-site, video, automated hybrid, and NFC-based solutions. With one of the broadest platforms of identity verification solutions, IDnow offers a fitting solution for all these categories.</p>



<p>The new technical specification revamps the policy and security requirements for identity proofing and trust services by introducing a new minimum Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) which is aligned with the requirements of eIDAS.</p>



<p>Therefore, the standard raises the security level across the identity proofing industry and provides the foundation for issuing qualified electronic signatures and other trust services in the future. Furthermore, ETSI TS 119 461 is expected to influence and be a foundation to further industry regulations, such as the upcoming update to the 6th European Anti-Money-Laundering Act (AMLD6) and the new eIDAS 2.0 framework.</p>



<p>“We welcome ETSI TS 119 461 as the new industry benchmark and especially the introduction of the new minimum Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP), something IDnow has been demanding for years. This will contribute to harmonizing minimum requirements in identity proofing and raises the level of security requirements and quality expectations across the industry,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology &amp; Co-Founder of IDnow.</p>



<p>The importance of collaboration between lawmakers and private industry experts</p>



<p>The creation of this new industry benchmark demonstrates the importance of involving the private sector in the development of industry-wide standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to have obtained the ETSI TS 119 461 certification because it clearly demonstrates that our IDnow platform fulfills the latest requirements in identity proofing for trust services. At the same time, we are quite pleased to have been selected as one of the private industry experts that contributed to the creation of this industry standard through the&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.etsi.org/stf/stfs/stf-homepages/stf588">ETSI Special Task Force 588</a>. As innovations in digital identity evolve both nationally and at the EU level, collaboration between technology leaders and policy makers is as relevant as ever,” says Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVzTRsqcyMU"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVzTRsqcyMU">Gordian Envelope videos</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>MVA Algorithm Suite. The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/master/static/images/spotbit-screen.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

  <p>As enterprises adopt new ways of collaboration and working, the area that has seen some of the biggest impact is the evolution of identity metadata to support improved and secure forms of access to IT infrastructure and services. Yet, this is still the most underrepresented aspect in target design conversations for most Identity Management programmes. As we move towards IAM 2.0 with the panes of evolution changing from what our approaches were in the pre-pandemic world, there is an opportunity for us to build our programmes based on sound Identity fabrics thereby leveraging the true power of cloud-based capabilities, drive agility in adopting and delivering new Identity services and reducing unmanaged technical debt significantly. The presenter will talk from his own viewpoint of having delivered IAM programmes and legacy transformation at scale using the sound principles of the Identity Fabrics.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-identity-fabrics-kumar-future-proof"></a>

<p>In what we see as a huge vote of confidence for the development of technologies and services that better protect data&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/">White House</a>&nbsp;has listed “privacy enhancing technologies” as one of the “industries of the future” in its April 2022 “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/04-2022-OSTP_IOTF_Report.pdf">OSTP Report on the Industries of the Future Act</a>”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/04-2022-OSTP_IOTF_Report.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;from the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and submitted to Congress defines IoTF as advanced industrial sectors that:&nbsp;</p>



  Support innovative, inclusive, equitable, and sustainable growth  Have profound connection with technology R&amp;D and STEM3 workforce  Require R&amp;D investments to support growth that will lead to transformative impact  Will significantly benefit future economic prosperity and national security.  



<p>According to the OSTP, the IoTF possess certain characteristics:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“… IoTF are not static. They change over time and reflect the potential of the future. They are topics that still have a firm footing in basic research and development (R&amp;D), yet show the potential to create economic value in the years ahead. They are often marked by a revolution in a technology as opposed to a natural evolution. This drastic change means they are accompanied by periods of uncertainty, with the most transformative applications still to be discovered. It is this hope for something new, something not yet realized, that drives excitement in the research, innovation, and policymaking communities. Sustained investments are required until economic drivers are established; this often necessitate public seeding of funds as risk may outweigh near-term gains as a specific industrial sector emerges.”</p>



<p>Privacy enhancing technologies sits on the list of IoTF in the White House report alongside:</p>



  Advanced computing&nbsp;  Advanced materials, manufacturing, and robotics&nbsp;  Advanced, next-generation communications technologies&nbsp;  Artificial intelligence&nbsp;  Battery technology&nbsp;  Biotechnology&nbsp;  Cybersecurity&nbsp;  Green products/clean technology  Plant genetics/agricultural technologies  Quantum information science/quantum computing&nbsp;  Nanotechnology&nbsp;  Semiconductors/microelectronics technologies.  



<p>The goal of the OSTP report is to identify “federal research and development investments, infrastructure, and workforce development investments that enable continued United States leadership in industries of the future (IoTF).”</p>



<p>In a further vote of confidence for privacy, the report notes the “Biden-Harris Administration has put forward proposals to dramatically increase Federal investments toward realizing Industries of the Future for the benefit of the American people, especially American workers.” Investments to support IoTF are currently at more than $10 billion annually.</p>



<p>We’ve always known privacy would be a defining feature of this decade and beyond. You might like:</p>

<p>Gambling with the future of our homes, streets and neighbourhoods.</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at Link Road: Photograph by Angela Grabowska<p>This piece was co-authored by members of the Dark Matter Labs and CIVIC SQUARE teams to build upon the ideas explored at <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">Retrofit Reimagined</a>, a four day neighbourhood festival that took place 13th — 16th July 2022 in Ladywood, an inner-city neighbourhood in Birmingham, UK. Retrofit Reimagined brought together neighbours, practitioners, and organisers from across the country who are focused on retrofit, its role in the future of decarbonising our built environment and a just transition. The festival was hosted in partnership between <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/">ACAN</a>, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a>, <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/">zero carbon&nbsp;house</a>.</p><p>This is the first of three blogs as part of the Retrofit Reimagined series. In this introductory blog we set out how the recent Energy Price Guarantee is a reflection of long-term systemic failures to invest, regulate and focus on our homes as essential infrastructure. Our second blog will unpack what we’ve learned together so far, amounting to a call for a Public-Civic Partnerships approach to the transition of our Homes, Streets and Neighbourhoods. Our final blog will outline our idea for a ‘Street Demonstrator’ that shows the possibilities of a Public-Civic Partnership and how it can respond to the age of poly-crisis.</p><p>Written in October 2022, this blog reflects our progress, learning and insights at that&nbsp;time.</p><p>If a long form read doesn’t suit how you would like to engage, here are a few shortcuts to different forms of media to explore the topics raised&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8VnIUrM2Q&amp;list=PLgIJxOKjWOpigXk97jKPuBLf5fsfGNWjb&amp;index=1&amp;t=25s">Retrofit Reimagined Festival: Video Playlist</a> — July 2022<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x3ThQZT9qbXo3L2eW0Bs_rxagFesL_E6">The Great Energy Gamble: Visual Slides</a> — October&nbsp;2022</p><p>Estimated Read Time: 14&nbsp;mins</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at Selwyn Playing Fields and Link Road: Photographs by Angela Grabowska<p>The cascading impacts of the energy crisis in the midst of climate breakdown are converging on our homes, streets and neighbourhoods, affecting every aspect of our lives — from food prices, material prices, logistics resilience, and our collective wellbeing. How we live, and how we live together, is changing and will change radically over the coming years. This cascading reality demands a deep transition in how we live — in combination of material, energy-conscious futures and a new landscape of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H_pIB8H0ps">healing homes</a>, streets and neighbourhood.</p><p>This is not a crisis that can be addressed individually, at the level of our homes alone. Nor can it be resolved through imposed and enforced top down solutions. It requires both civic organising and infrastructure, nested at the level of the street, neighbourhood and the city, alongside new state intervention at the scale of establishing the National Health Service or seeding the Social Housing Movement. This future requires a new Public-Civic Partnership.</p> Short Term Shocks &amp; Long Term&nbsp;Trends <p>The UK is undergoing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60846951">the biggest reduction in living standards</a> since the Second World War with high levels of inflation, underinvestment in public services and growing inequality. The <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2022/september/huw-pill-speech-at-the-institute-of-directors-dinner">recent turbulence in financial markets</a> is the latest in a series of long term trends: the ongoing downward valuation of the pound; increasing levels of government debt and rising costs of food and energy (even before the war in Ukraine); and extreme weather associated with climate change. We find ourselves in a <a href="https://cascadeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/What-is-a-global-polycrisis-v2.pdf">polycrisis </a>— where multiple globalised systems become entangled in ways that have cascading impacts on our lives and the natural world we rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>Amongst the economic, political and emotional tumult of the past few weeks, it is easy to lose track of the fact that a large part of the immediate cause of unrest in financial markets is the UK government’s decision to both cut taxes and commit an estimated <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/response-energy-price-guarantee">£100–150bn</a> of taxpayers’ money to fund an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-announces-energy-price-guarantee-for-families-and-businesses-while-urgently-taking-action-to-reform-broken-energy-market">Energy Price Guarantee</a> at the same time. The Guarantee will pay energy companies the difference between the wholesale energy market price and a maximum energy unit charge. This is perhaps the single <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCMoreOrLess/status/1570008762362073097?s=20&amp;t=dkS6ZYT3PITrgmRD82cmDw">biggest</a> government spending announcement of the past few&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Clearly an emergency response was needed due to previous lack of bold action. Domestic electricity costs are pegged to gas prices which have been rising for some time and have spiked during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the structure of the Energy Price Guarantee represents a huge transfer of wealth (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies">amongst other subsidies</a>) to the fossil fuel industry from the public purse — a sector that has historically been responsible for creating the climate emergency and one that has <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-fossil-fuelled-climate-denial-61273">funded </a>climate change denialism for decades. The approach is <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/a-chilling-crisis">regressive and poorly targeted</a> with those in the largest houses typically getting the most benefit and those already under-heating their homes standing to gain the least. The structure of the Guarantee also does little to incentivise energy saving and could make other approaches to funding energy efficiency harder to implement.</p> Because the Guarantee is funded by government borrowing against future tax income in a period of rising interest rates, it represents a massive financial cost on future generations already burdened by the climate crisis and decades of under-investment. <p>The cost of the Guarantee is in effect <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/a-blank-cheque/">uncapped</a>, but current estimates put it in the same ballpark as the Banking Bailout of 2008/09 but, unlike in the bailout, this time the UK state won’t get any of this back in the future. The costs to the taxpayer will only stop increasing if the wholesale price of energy reduces (a factor largely beyond the control of the UK), if the government withdraws the support, or if there is fundamental market reform. And it does nothing to encourage retrofitting of homes which is a requirement for any path <a href="https://www.edie.net/only-through-a-retrofitting-revolution-can-we-meet-our-2050-net-zero-carbon-target-in-the-uks-major-cities/">to net&nbsp;zero</a>.</p><p>This Energy Price Guarantee is therefore a guarantee for fossil fuel companies, but also a massive gamble for current and future taxpayers more broadly. By not investing strategically in effective deep retrofit and neighbourhood resilience, we are gambling with our own prospects for a brighter future and perhaps equally critical, our ability to address the cascading impact of the energy crisis that are part of a wider polycrisis in the midst of climate breakdown.</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at zero carbon house and Link Road: Photograph by Angela Grabowska How Did We Get&nbsp;Here? <p>We believe, this polycrisis is converging in our homes, streets, neighbourhoods and cities — and solutions needs to born there. It is a crisis not just of energy, but of materiality, of economic capacity, imagination and social resilience, affecting every part of our&nbsp;lives.</p><p>As a society we have failed to invest effectively in our homes and neighbourhoods. At the heart of this lies the challenge and opportunity of retrofit — improving the fabric of our homes to make them more comfortable, healthier and able to use less energy. <a href="http://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://thirtypercy.org/">Thirty Percy Foundation</a> and <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase</a>, have been working together around <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">retrofit</a> for the past two years, understanding the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">barriers</a> and exploring its <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">potential</a> at a neighbourhood and city scale. We have found that retrofit is linked to a wide range of positive <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/new-value-flows-impact-modelling-and-financing-neighbourhood-retrofit-v0-1-8674f795cef8">outcomes</a> that are not currently reflected in how it is being organised, <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprovocations.darkmatterlabs.org%2Ffinancing-sustainability-transitions-in-search-of-a-new-civic-led-orthodoxy-1e615288309f">financed</a> or governed.</p><p>In the UK, political decisions were taken to <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8964/CBP-8964.pdf">reduce</a> funding that led to a cut in rates of retrofit and insulation by around <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/home-insulation-and-the-net-zero-target/">95%</a> compared to 2012. Yet, the issue lies as much with a fundamentally flawed delivery model as with the low level of financial investment. Currently only households that meet very strict criteria may be eligible for measures to be installed at rock bottom rates, typically by centrally procured contractors. Outcomes are mixed. For example, despite costing over £1bn a year, only 57% of recipients for grant-based insulation measures under one programme <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003872/eco-wave-1-summary-report.pdf">reported</a> receiving some or significant benefits from the measures installed. In any case, most of the easiest measures have now been done, and a more <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fretrofitacademy.org%2Fwhat-does-whole-house-retrofit-mean-to-me%2F">holistic</a> approach to improving our homes is required.</p><blockquote>“Home is no place for&nbsp;profit.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Araceli Carmargo, <a href="https://www.thecentriclab.com/">Centric&nbsp;Lab</a></blockquote><p>And what about the four fifths of households who don’t qualify or don’t live in a socially rented home with a responsible landlord? Apart from some high level <a href="https://www.simpleenergyadvice.org.uk/">advice</a> and guidance, there is almost no support. A recent <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9235/">attempt</a> to build a debt-funded approach for homeowners to implementation didn’t deliver and was scrapped.</p> As a country, we have mistakenly assumed that the way to deliver on our retrofitting needs is to enable individual action through market-based solutions, supported by extractive labour practices through standardised measures dictated by Whitehall. It relies on low cost single-use materials mainly made with, or using, fossil fuels, and simply isn’t fit for&nbsp;purpose. Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at Selwyn Playing Fields and zero carbon house: Photographs by Angela Grabowska Retrofit Reimagined <p>With the above backdrop, and green shoots of hopeful, holistic and systemic practice emerging across the country. In July 2022 as a partnership <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matters Labs</a>, <a href="http://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a>, <a href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/">zero carbon house</a>, and <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/">ACAN</a> hosted a coalescence of people and organisations in Ladywood — the neighbourhood that CIVIC SQUARE is proud to call home in inner city Birmingham, UK. <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">Retrofit Reimagined</a> was designed to bring together people from across the neighbourhood and wider field who were interested in reimagining retrofit and convened around the core question:</p> What if the climate transition and retrofit of our homes, streets and neighbourhoods were designed, owned and governed by the people who live&nbsp;there? <blockquote>“With Retrofit Reimagined, architects were seen as valued members of communities first and that positioning amongst a plurality of voices and professions was a worthwhile reframing for everyone’s role in the climate emergency.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Sara Edmonds, <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/">ACAN</a><br><a href="https://www.architectscan.org/post/report-from-retrofit-reimagined-2022">https://www.architectscan.org/post/report-from-retrofit-reimagined-202</a>2</blockquote><p>Here we heard from a whole range of people both from the built environment, and beyond technical experts, community organisers, architects, financiers, policy makers, philanthropists, activists, citizens and many others. From ideas around the foundational healing justice role of the place we call home to how we redesign the finance to go beyond a top down house by house approach. The attendance and feedback from across many spaces, experiences, and vantage points reoriented our collective goals away from merely an individual technical challenge, and towards a important and unique moment to invest and organise in a way towards retrofit as a moment of deep societal renewal, the scale which could be likened to the founding of the NHS, or seeding of the social housing movement. This wide spectrum of voices and perspectives showed that there is deep and broad support for civic and community-led retrofit, but few clear pathways that overcome the major <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">barriers</a> we&nbsp;face.</p><p>What <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/post/report-from-retrofit-reimagined-2022">emerged</a> was a consensus that retrofit is not just a technical exercise in optimising energy use or carbon emissions for each individual household, but a process of establishing a <a href="https://www.thecentriclab.com/heating-and-a-healing-home">deeper relationship</a> between residents, the homes they live in, the co-benefits possible and the communities they are part of in a way that supports mutual aid and social justice. Where talk of low demand and interest from communities for retrofit is loud in the national rhetoric, our work in Ladywood, the mix of participants at Retrofit Reimagined, the pioneering work happening across the country shows this story to be far from true. Our neighbourhoods are brimming with energy, insight, will, openness, imagination and deep hope. Our current organising, governance, and finance frameworks, or vision for national retrofit, aren’t close to unlocking this deep dividend.</p> Retrofit Reimagined was a demonstration of how convening and organising as a collective can broaden our incentive structures towards common goods and public-civic value — from investment in houses, to investment in places and the systems they depend&nbsp;on. <p>Whilst our national approach may be moving at a glacial pace, there are green shoots already demonstrating more equitable ways forward, generating hope, moving loudly and at pace. Collective and area-based models are starting to replace the piecemeal approach of consumer-led retrofit. Approaches like these that retrofit the home as part of a larger urban system must take priority, from the scale of the street to the social housing block. Providers are starting to develop one stop shops and services, neighbourhood labs and campaigns are ramping up the pressure for new models, and there is lots to draw energy and inspiration from.</p><p>Explore the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8VnIUrM2Q&amp;list=PLgIJxOKjWOpigXk97jKPuBLf5fsfGNWjb">Retrofit Reimagined video playlist</a> to watch back the talks from the event, and find out more about how connect with those incredible practitioners we were honoured to have involved in this first festival.</p><blockquote>“By prioritising community and care with programming, participation and production the festival felt revolutionary in comparison to the staid circuit of architecture events we’ve gotten used to and exactly what we need more of in a climate emergency.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Bobby Jewell, Architecture Today<br><a href="https://architecturetoday.co.uk/retrofit-reimagined-festival/">https://architecturetoday.co.uk/retrofit-reimagined-festival/</a></blockquote>Explore these From → To primers for the broader scale of reimagination required in more detail&nbsp;<a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">here</a>. The Expanding Sense Of&nbsp;Crisis <p>Since July, the cost of living and specifically energy costs have dramatically taken centre stage in our national political debate and in households and streets up and down the country. Strategic underinvestment, a broken market and failing regulations have and are increasingly tipping millions of households into real hardship, and making otherwise viable businesses fail through no fault of their&nbsp;own.</p><p>Most other <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis">countries</a> and commentators have come up with <a href="https://neweconomics.org/2022/09/warm-homes-cool-planet">better </a>solutions that are implementable, for example, a universal basic energy allowance supplemented by changes to the benefits system, changes to the energy market structure and regulation. There are multiple variations where energy tariffs are stepped, with low energy users paying less per unit of gas or electricity than those who may use much more. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/labours-low-carbon-plans-look-like-sensible-economic-policy">Labour Party</a> has announced that, if elected, they would establish a publicly owned energy company alongside a major uplift in investment in insulation and a decarbonisation of the&nbsp;grid.</p><p>These policy responses are welcome, but the question of how best to deliver them over the coming years remains unanswered. Simply providing more resources in the form of short-term, nationally mandated, single-measure grant programmes using existing procurement approaches will not lead to the long term, increased local resilience that we need. We need to reimagine how to reconfigure the approach to unlock and augment the latent energy and capacity of the civic sector, and to realise the cascading benefits of doing&nbsp;so.</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 on Link Road: Photographs by Angela Grabowska A New Pathway For Safe, Just Neighbourhood Transitions <p>So, what did we learn through the Retrofit Reimagined enquiry so far that can be applied to the situation we now find ourselves in? What would a different path look like that would be regenerative, progressive and long-term? How would this support building long term resilience, a green economy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts">energy independence</a>?</p><p>Imagine if we allocated the £150bn set aside for the Energy Price Guarantee to support locally-led, place-based retrofit programmes. Imagine if they supported local training, low-cost or free home upgrades, and were designed to circulate money into the local economy, help build community pride and strength, while also generating massive positive impacts in health and wellbeing. There is strong evidence that a tailored approach would create major benefits and help to support the wider transition beyond retrofit by building distributed capacity and capability across our neighbourhoods, regions and nations. Another way to put it, is imagine spending tens of billions, for something that creates no improvements to energy security, housing quality or carbon pollution, whilst also barely lifting the most vulnerable out of deep&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>That is why we are calling for a new national energy and retrofit programme that draws upon the power of the state as well as the power of our streets and neighbourhoods. We need these Public-Civic Partnerships to not only deliver our collective retrofitting needs, but for citizens to become stewards of their local transitions towards fairer, greener&nbsp;futures.</p><p>The Retrofit Reimagined blog series will continue with part two: A Better Way To Spend £150bn, to follow shortly, describing a new approach to investment in our homes and neighbourhoods through a long term restructuring of how the state and civic society work together, through a new Public-Civic Partnership.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-british-energy-swindle-92a059a49248">The Great British Energy Swindle</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>This week, Indicio&nbsp;announced an important new product in the Proven product line: Holdr+. As Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, explains: Holdr+is “a mobile way to connect with and coordinate credentials from different systems that were otherwise unusable outside those systems. With Holdr+, they now have that flexibility. We’re focused on Aries-based credentials right now, given that they are the most widely used, but we aim to make Holdr+ a way to use all credentials-either directly or through development contributions from the open source community.”</p>

<p>As an information security standard, ISO 27001 can be beneficial to understand and comply with, but what exactly is ISO 27001?</p>
<p>What does ISO 27001 mean? ISO 27001 is a regulation for Information Security Management Systems, which explains physical and logical controls an organization should abide by to protect their information more methodically.</p>
 What Are ISO 27000 Standards? 
<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international organization dedicated to developing practical standards around technical and professional operations such that any organization can follow them.</p>
<p>The ISO 27000 series is one such group of standards published by the ISO to address cybersecurity concerns in private organizations. This series covers several approaches to cybersecurity, from IT and network security to auditor guidelines and industry-specific practices.</p>
<p>Some of the primary documents in this series, found in the earliest sequential publications, include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html">ISO/IEC 27001</a>, “Information technology – security techniques – information security management systems – requirements”: ISO 27001 covers the specifics of creating and implementing Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), which we will cover in more detail in this blog. 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75652.html">ISO/IEC 27002</a>, “Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – information security controls”: A list of specific security controls that may be used as part of an ISMS. 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63417.html">ISO/IEC 27003</a>, “information security management system implementation guidance”: As the title implies, this document guides on implementing ISMSs. More specifically, this will break down the requirements outlined in ISO 27001 to provide specifics on how to implement them in real-world enterprise situations. 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/64120.html">ISO/IEC 27004</a>, “Information technology – security techniques, information security management – monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation”: This publication provides specific requirements and practices that enterprises using an ISMS would use to evaluate effectiveness. This practice includes creating metrics, measuring data, monitoring system components, and more. 
 
<p>These are just the tip of this iceberg, as the ISO 27000 series has over 60 individual publications. For the most part, however, ISO 27001 is the most commonly adopted standard.</p>
 What Is ISO 27001? 
<p>ISO 27001 is a standard for developing an ISMS, a unique designation for an organization-wide network of people, processes, rules, and technologies that promote security. These can include documented processes or informal practices for specific problems, but both will fall under an overarching management plan tailored to specific security goals.</p>
 What Is an Information Security Management System? 
<p>In the broadest sense, an ISMS focuses on addressing the so-called CIA triad of security concerns:</p>
 
 Confidentiality: That data remains confidential and secured against unauthorized disclosure. 
 Integrity: That data remains whole and unaltered due to malicious tampering or corruption through improper processing or technology failures. 
 Availability: That data remains accessible to authorized persons for business use or customer/client/patient support. 
 
<p>Furthermore, an ISMS will allow an organization to accomplish a set of objectives, including:</p>
<p>Identifying stakeholders in an organization to determine IT security expectations.<br>
Identifying risks to technology and data security<br>
Defining security controls to address concerns and expectations and mitigate risks<br>
Setting security objectives organization-wide for IT systems<br>
Implementing controls and mitigation efforts in line with security objectives<br>
Measure and monitor controls for effectiveness<br>
Improve controls in cases of new threats, breaches, or ineffective operation</p>
<p>The ISMS isn’t a specific set of technology, but the governance policies around what needs to be secured, how, by whom, and how effectively. The ISMS, therefore, should be able to address compliance and legal requirements, organizational and enterprise goals, and operational necessities like data usability and budget.</p>
 What Are the ISO 27001 Requirements? 
<p>The ISO 27001 documentation defines several requirements for an ISMS. These requirements are defined in this document, and any future documents take these requirements as a reference in helping an organization implement the ISMS.</p>
<p>The requirements of an ISMS are:</p>
 
 Context and Organization: Your organization must understand its own business context, including security needs, internal and external stakeholders, industry and regulatory standards, and potential fallout from ineffective security or data breach. 
 Leadership: Your organization must have the leadership to create, implement, and maintain an ISMS. This can include specific executives (CIOs, CTOs, CISOs), compliance officers, IT management, and stakeholders or their representatives. 
 Planning: Your organization should plan the ISMS with clear information (usually from knowledge fulfilling the first requirement). This can also include vulnerability scans, risk assessments, and other diagnostics. 
 Support: Your organization must be able to allocate and distribute resources to teams managing the ISMS. This includes having the ability to communicate with team members, create organization-wide policies and education, and distribute guides, documentation, and best practices. 
 Operation: All processes for any aspect of the ISMS must be implemented and controlled. This includes implementing risk assessments for those processes. 
 Evaluation: Your organization must monitor, analyze, and assess the ISMS during its operation. This calls for internal audits and reviews. 
 Improvement: Based on the results of any internal tests, measurements, or audits, your organization should be able to implement changes and improvements, including system upgrades, retirement and replacement of equipment, changes to policies, or mitigation efforts following breaches. 
 
 The 14 Domains of ISO 27001 
<p>Finally, the requirements of ISO 27001 will cover 14 specific domains, including several control categories, of security and operations in your organization. These domains include:</p>
 
 Information Security Policies, or aligning security policies with company goals 
 Information Security Organization, or the establishment of management and personnel structures and maintaining the security of tools used by those teams. 
 Human Resource Security, or securing personnel and data involved in HR operations. 
 Asset Management, or the identification, classification, and protection of governed assets – including data and processing resources. 
 Access Control, or maintaining restricted access to processing and data resources for only authorized users related to their role in the organization.<br>
Cryptography, or the obfuscation of data at rest or in transit. 
 Physical and Environmental Security, or protecting physical processing facilities against damage, theft, or disaster. 
 Operations Security, or the safeguarding of processing facilities against unauthorized access or data loss. 
 Communications Security, or data protection as it moves through business networks. 
 System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance, or the securely strategizing and planning of acquiring, expanding, and retiring system equipment. 
 Supplier Relations, or analyzing third-party vendor relationships and agreements 
 Information Security Incident Management, or detecting and responding to security issues as they happen. 
 Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity, or ensuring that security measures will remain effective in cases of business disruptions. 
 Compliance, or integrating any regulations or frameworks specific to business or industry operations. 
 
 Stay On Top of ISO 27001 Certification with 1Kosmos 
<p>While ISO 27001 isn’t a mandatory regulation, it is a strong and productive framework around which organizations should build their cybersecurity and compliance efforts. It touches on several baseline security elements considered best practices across most industries.</p>
<p>One of these best practices is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a>, and like many frameworks, ISO 27001 calls for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/strong-authentication/">strong authentication</a> that includes multi-factor approaches or better.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides this level of security with the following features:</p>
 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

Then you can log&nbsp;in.</p><p>Do you know your social security number, home address, and mother’s maiden name? Then you can sign up for the&nbsp;service.</p><p>You can probably see why this is a problematic way to deal with something as important as your identity. If someone nefarious finds out what you know, not only could they access your existing accounts, they could open up new ones in your name. With data breaches on the rise at a mammoth scale, that proposition becomes likelier by the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Anyone who has had their identity stolen knows just how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/your-money/identity-theft-auto-insurance.html">painful the process of getting things back in order can be</a>. For some, it unfortunately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/retirementspecial/old-trusting-and-prime-prey-for-swindlers.html">becomes a lifelong&nbsp;pursuit</a>.</p><p>A much more secure way for managing our digital identities is to base it on what we&nbsp;have.</p><p>For instance, do you have access to your smartphone?</p><p>It’s immediately clear why such a framework is far more secure than the former. Wouldbe criminals would need to physically have your phone in their possession. They’d also need a way to get in — a tough ask if you have a PIN or fingerprint security set up. That’s something that might be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262347/attorney-general-barr-fbi-director-wray-apple-encryption-pensacola">possible for the FBI</a> but likely outside the wheelhouse of most fraudsters.</p><p>Traditional digital identities still based on what we know have gotten the memo. It’s why two-factor authentication is highly recommended if you want to keep your accounts secure. Now, it’s also about what you&nbsp;have.</p><p>But that transition is still only a half&nbsp;measure.</p><p>Eventually, it makes sense to shift toward a completely device-based identity. That way, your sensitive personal data is stored locally on your own device rather than hosted on some company’s server that becomes a target for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>With device-based identity, you’re in complete control of your data as well as your private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>This also opens the door for additional features that should become commonplace in the future such as identity portability and reusability.</p><p>We’ll be able to bring our identities with us from one service to the next. The reputation and social connections you create on one platform will be easily transferable if you ever decide to venture elsewhere.</p><p>We’ll also be able to verify our identities once and never again, re-using that verified identity for any additional services we sign up for. That minimizes the amount of data we share with other parties while still allowing businesses to trust who their customers are who they say they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Best of all, it reduces friction for everyone. No more selfies. No more taking photos of your passport.

<p>What makes Holochain special? Google searches, TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram dominate the internet as we know it. These “KillerApps” represent the core of the internet to us. So what is Holochain’s KillerApp? </p><p>First let’s reframe from KillerApp to <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2016/03/16/id-328">MotherApp</a>; starting from a place of cooperation rather than competition. Consider how we could offer a genesis experience — a new way of interacting online — which will spawn many new apps and experiences built on these same principles. &nbsp;</p><p>We believe that at the heart of such a genesis experience lies one key capacity: the ease of forking, or what we also like to call walkaway (inspired by Cory Doctorow’s <a href="https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/">book</a>). This capacity forms the heart of what makes open-source software so valuable, the fundamental capacity for anyone to take what’s there and improve, modify, and fork it into a better reality. To walk away from the enclosure of one space and into the creation of a new one. Currently this capacity lives only at the code level (e.g. GitHub). But the deepest value of the current Internet lies not in application code, but in the data the users of the platforms provide and the web of relationships this data creates. All of our major platforms capture the value of this data in exchange for the services they provide. Corporations do not charge for these services because they have found another way to monetize them. In the modern attention economy, data mining reveals what holds our attention and turns it into a commodity. Brokering our attention to advertisers funds the current internet; and keeping our data unforkable, as a company's private property, maintains a profitable monopoly.</p><p>Thus, we claim that the MotherApp of the next internet arrives with the ability to fork not only code, but also platform level data. It’s not good enough that a single user can download their own history from Facebook. We need an underlying infrastructure by which an entire group of people can walkaway together with all of their data as well as the application’s code into a new improved space as easily as they can click “fork” on GitHub today.</p><blockquote>Rather than holding data centrally, Holochain distributes all application data collectively between the users of the apps. Each user not only holds the application’s code, but a portion of the network’s data along with their own personal data, allowing for both uptime and data ownership on a p2p network. </blockquote><p>Holochain delivers exactly such underlying infrastructure, what we call an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blog-holochain-org-capture-resistance-from-the-ground-up/">uncapturable carrier</a>. More than just an open-source grammar with which anyone can build their own protocols and applications running those protocols, Holochain also provides a novel, distributed structure for data. Rather than holding data centrally, Holochain distributes all application data collectively between the users of the apps. Each user not only holds the application’s code, but a portion of the network’s data along with their own personal data, allowing for both uptime and data ownership on a p2p network. This collective data ownership means subsets of those users can always fork applications at will. If you don’t like how an app or community functions you can simply fork it and all of its relevant data, add your own adjustments, and invite others to join you. This deep level of interoperability helps to address network effects while allowing for evolutionary growth of the ecosystem. </p><p>A MotherApp for Holochain then must give users a visceral experience of this uncapturability. By giving users the ability to develop their own segmented spaces of coherence the MotherApp itself will help future projects grow from that initial experience. To fully embody this, communities need to undergo forking.</p><p>Next, this article will discuss a couple of recently developed Holochain apps (hApps) and how they might provide this experience of walkaway. The article will also consider some of the challenges and benefits of forking, finally looking to the future of the ecosystem and its growth.</p> Walkaway for Project Management <p><a href="https://acorn.software/">Acorn</a>, a project management hApp, provides a simple interface where users can arrange intended outcomes into a dependency tree structure that helps break-down and prioritize complex projects. Each tree represents a particular project space which can be shared with other collaborators. When a collaborator adds an item or extends a tree, this propagates out to other collaborators sharing the project space. </p><p>Now imagine if a sub-group of collaborators realizes that the project has gone off track, or they decide they want to go in a different direction with their work. They can simply copy the workspace and all the shared data, give it a new name so it has a unique identifier, and move on, potentially sharing this new space with an entirely new set of collaborators. Meanwhile, the old space continues to work just fine for those still using it.</p>Acorn's "Map Veiw"<p>This may seem almost identical to what happens when copying a google document and adding changes to a new private version of the doc, essentially forking the data. However, differences appear when we look more closely.</p><p>When working with a Google doc, Google holds all of that data in the cloud on their servers. Acorn users spread the data across their local devices, maintaining redundant copies but providing direct local access to each user. Even more importantly, Acorn provides open access to its locally held application code. Where Google could implement a new change that removes access to a particular tool, this cannot happen with Acorn. As long as a user holds this version of the code they can run the program and share it with others. And if they want to add a change, they can easily fork the software. </p> The Why of Walkaway <p>What makes walkaway important? The cloud storage of Google Drive and similar services already do exactly what many need. As Moxie Marlinspike has <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">already pointed out</a>, most people don’t want to run their own servers. Most people probably don’t want to run their own code either. </p>Walkaway is about the right to carve out a new road, avoiding monopolies and the tolls that come with them. Said another way, Walkaway is about biodiversity. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/0Ezh0PRhtPo">Source</a><p>Walkaway becomes important though as a way to break from and avoid monopolies by mega corporations and as a way to create diversity within our communities and tools. The example above looks at a small-scale, individualistic form of walkaway, but as we’ll go on to see, the larger more meaningful forms of walkaway require a collective. Thus communities, not individuals, will gain the most benefit from walkaway. Whether an offshoot of an open-source coding collective or a local youth group fracturing from a larger institution, the ability to fork code and data gives a community a sort of sovereignty that does not depend on either the individual nor the institution/state. </p><blockquote>...the ability to fork code and data gives a community a sort of sovereignty that does not depend on either the individual nor the institution/state. </blockquote><p>The design of Holochain as an uncapturable carrier means that hApps hold data publicly. Each individual has the right to their own data, but the data created in the public sphere at the same time remains public. As we’ll see, this gains importance when social groups split, helping to maintain the social histories and accounts across spaces. Thus, the group cannot hold an individual hostage, nor can any individual hold the group hostage by controlling the server.</p> Walkaway for Collaboration <p>We, a new hApp from <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/">Lightningrod Labs</a>, aims to provide users with a tool for <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390">generalized collaborative power</a>. Developed as a container for social interaction, We allows users to build highly customizable digital spaces for collaboration, without predetermining the nature of these spaces. Users will be able to load “applets” into We to give it different functionalities from threaded chat and calendar invites to video calls, whiteboards, voting, and currencies. Because applets are just repackaged Holochain apps, almost all hApps could potentially be implemented within We.</p><p>Designed to be, per Einstein's provocation, “as simple as possible, but not simpler,” We is an interface for managing the boundaries and connections between different spaces. One example of this is cross applet functionality. When running multiple instances of the same applet in different We spaces at once you can easily shift between group-centric and applet-centric views, for example allowing you to see just the calendar events of your current group or all of your events across different groups at the same time. We provides developers affordances to enhance and enable both of these perspectives.</p><blockquote>We is an interface for managing the boundaries and connections between different spaces.</blockquote><p>The real strength of We comes from taking the idea of groupware and generalizing it beyond any one functionality, while at the same time allowing communities to form membranes and self govern. As agent-centric software, each user decides what groups and applets they opt into. Similarly, community governance would happen from an agent-centric basis. Bad actors can potentially be removed via ban lists that each user opts into rather than being censored from the top down. The overlapping decisions and interactions of individual agents form together into communities, rather than communities existing as something predefined. These principles and associated tools like <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#membrane-proof">membrane proofs</a> and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#capability-grant">capability grants</a> are inherited from Holochain itself. We just provides the structure and user interface needed for these networked relationships to be integrated and more accessible. Because every Holochain app has the structural properties of a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Sovereign Accountable Commons</a> (SAC), these social spaces can quickly morph into DAOs. As digital communities that need to make decisions collectively, each space will need <a href="https://hackmd.io/Xf9LhBnyQ9Ga0RGLUrxsIQ">different levels of protocol</a> to help them embody their decisions and agreements. </p><blockquote>Sometimes communities diverge. But with entwined pasts, each should be able to set out with a copy of the data and the platform. Walkaway enables this type of continuity.</blockquote><p>This is where walkaway and the art of the fork come back. Sometimes communities diverge. This doesn’t mean that their pasts were not entwined however; one group starting over from scratch while the other maintains the old platform sets up very different power relations than when both move forward from the same place, each with a copy of the data and the platform. Walkaway enables this type of continuity. </p><p>Like with Acorn, and any hApp for that matter, a user will be able to fork We at will. This goes for the code as well as the data. If you want to start a new space because you disagree with a decision made by your community, do so. Want to change how We verifies data structures? Copy your current version of the software, make the edits you need, and launch. </p><p>But don’t forget to invite your friends. We isn't of much use to just one person.</p> Walkaway is non-trivial Walkaway is costly, and it takes a community. While an individual can fork code and data, people have to follow for that to be useful. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/6U5AEmQIajg">Source</a><p>Walking away from anything takes effort. Most software on the internet today gains its use value not just from the technical aspects of the tool in and of itself but because of the community of people it connects you to. This is certainly the case with social media and groupware like We, but it is also the case for, as an example, a map application like Google Maps. Users, from businesses to individuals, add rich context to the map through daily updates and through their activity on the app. To learn how busy a restaurant is or a business's operating hours you check Google Maps. Users either add or create this data and give the app its value.</p><blockquote>To fork a social space you need allies, people who will shift with you to the new environment and bring it value.</blockquote><p>To fork a social space you need allies, people who will shift with you to the new environment and bring it value. Network effects make walkaway more difficult. However, in building an environment that encourages forking, we expect a greater culture of walkaway and a diversity of versions of any program. Holochain also enables interoperable connections between forked spaces. This gives users autonomy while not giving up the benefits of connection to broader networks and also provides groups the ability to customize their software without locking out potential users. </p> What’s Next: Walkaway for Digital Ecologies <p>We acts as a MotherApp for Holochain because it gives users an easy and intuitive way to experience forking on both social and technical levels. Once users can walkaway in practice, both its ease and its social costs, become readily evident.</p><blockquote>Imagine forking as a form of birth through mitosis, the splitting of cells. As protocols and communities continue to diverge and coalesce they fill niches and expand the ecology, meeting the needs of users through an iterative, evolving process.</blockquote><p>You often hear about digital ecosystems. But this rarely refers to more than products that somehow connect to or benefit each other. We, and Holochain more broadly, attempts to actualize the vision of a digital ecology. Imagine forking as a form of birth through mitosis, the splitting of cells. As protocols and communities continue to diverge and coalesce they fill niches and expand the ecology, meeting the needs of users through an iterative, evolving process. No longer simply products, they become organisms. </p>Meta-gramatics form a game for writing new rules. Like biology, different organisms form together to symbolically form new structures. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1PpyUZceg_I">Source</a><p>Ecosystem-like structures use building blocks (DNA, code, grammar), which instruct the system on how the content (organisms, data, speech, energy), takes shape and gains meaning. Thus, We provides a meta-grammatics, a set of rules that facilitate the development of new rules. A meta-grammatics that makes it easy to iterate and create new spaces requires a rule that lets you walk away to new spaces and to choose which spaces to inhabit. Ecologies also need the ability to merge spaces and for organisms to interrelate. </p><p>A grammatics for powerful group evolution requires more than just forking. The 4 Fs (Forge, Fork, Federate, and Fuse) expand this grammatical capacity as described in the following:</p>  Forging creates original new spaces from scratch.  Forking simply creates a new space by modifying an old one.  Federating applies a protocol to interconnect two existing spaces while leaving them distinct.  Fusing merges two separate communities into one.   <p>Federation in We is just adding the same instance of an applet into two different We groups, each user independently opting in to the shared app. The fusion of two communities then is simply what happens when they fully federate all of their applets. Thus fusion can happen all at once or slowly over time on an as needed basis; the same goes for walkaway. What’s beautiful about the Holochain architecture is that it allows rule sets to be brought together as composable chunks, thus meta-grammatics. The examples here and throughout this article describe just a small portion of the problem spaces that the 4 Fs bring with them. They also only illuminate a glimpse of the benefits. </p><blockquote>What’s beautiful about the Holochain architecture is that it allows rule sets to be brought together as composable chunks, thus meta-grammatics.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, many in the Holochain community endeavor to provide not a platform but a new grammatic capacity with the goal of creating change and to allow others to build the platforms they need. With an explosion of social spaces, users have a diversity of options to choose from. These communities and the grammers that support them break the norm of monolithic institutions which provide a singular way to navigate society, rather they give many different avenues through which to access community and social services. As a diversity of platforms spawn from this root, it will provide ways to interact with others and build new ecosystems together. </p><p>You can now download an alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a> through the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>.</p>

 UAE’s fintech revolution has begun. But can its banks balance customer expectations for better, more digital services with strict, local regulations? 



 



<p>Fintech has played a huge part in the UAE’s digital evolution over the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Government initiatives to propel the country toward a forward-thinking, technology-focused future have been matched by the launch of a plethora of online services from the private sector. Hospitality, commerce, and, of course, banking are just some of the sectors that have responded to the demand for digital services from tech-savvy citizens and residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The COVID pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation efforts of many local organizations. In fact, according to a <a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/170321-MIT-Wamda-E-Commerce-COVID19-report-EN-01.pdf">report </a>compiled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and Wamda, a platform of programs for entrepreneurs in the Middle East, eCommerce grew by 52% in the first year of the pandemic alone. As a result, investment in fintech startups more than doubled (US$78 million) in 2020. The fintech revolution has affected everything from online transactions and payment gateways to KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With some of the world’s fastest internet speeds, and high smartphone adoption rates, fintech companies in Dubai and throughout UAE have been able to grow and diversify at a rapid rate, such as the Buy Now Pay Later local player Tabby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers now want more control over their finances – whether from a computer or through their smartphone. What they don’t want is to queue up at the bank only to be told they’ve forgotten a vital document to secure their loan.</p>



<p>Although regional challenger banks like <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk">Wio</a> have seized the opportunity to revolutionize banking, some incumbent banks have been slow to adapt. In fact, traditional banks across the world have been slow to kick-start their digitalization efforts. According to <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/07/covid-19-impact-on-banking-m-and-a-2020.html">KPMG’s Global Banking Outlook H2 2020 report</a>, this is because institutions lack foresight, and how to correctly implement their digitalization efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abu Dhabi-based Wio, for example, offers 24/7 digital banking that allows its customers to access and manage their finances around the clock. Fully digital platforms like <a href="https://xpence.com/#home">Xpence</a> and <a href="https://ogpay.com/">OG Pay</a> are also thriving in the UAE, and pulling customers away from archaic incumbent bank setups and processes that force customers to access services in-person, or via a phone call.</p>



<p>However, while traditional banks and fintechs seem to be on different service paths, there are similar challenges and opportunities that they share.&nbsp;</p>



 The challenges of fintech. 



<p>Governments and regulators tend to prescribe the rules and regulations of what traditional banks can and can’t do. As they cannot extend their offerings without a rigorous number of approvals and checks, this can severely hinder their expansion efforts. Specific laws, rules and requirements can also change from country to country. While similar regulations apply to fintechs, the problem is compounded by a clunky fit of laws and regulations that are still catching up with the technology they’re trying to regulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UAE, digitalization of services – especially when it comes to onboarding new customers – is a major challenge as central banks and regulators still undertake assessment on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; An additional complexity is that identities must be verified and approved by the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, which can currently only be done in person. This means the customer must either drive to the bank and provide ID, or the bank sends a member of staff to the customer’s home or office with a card reader to confirm the authenticity of their documentation. Fintechs, on the other hand, allow their customers to onboard digitally using digital identity solution providers like IDnow, which has gained the approval of local regulators, The Dubai Financial Services Authority and Abu Dhabi Global Market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using fintech to streamline an established banking institution’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20stands%20for%20%E2%80%9CKnow%20your,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">KYC process</a> and customer journey seems like a logical step to take. It can speed up the onboarding process, deliver 24/7 access to money management, and provide customers with complete control of their finances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital identity proofing and verification can help onboarding for a range of financial services, including&nbsp;banking, fintech, Buy Now Pay Later, digital assets and cryptocurrency platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of the financial landscape in the UAE. 



<p>Digital identity verification provides huge opportunities for fintechs and banks to shape the future of the UAE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to our recently conducted YouGov survey, UAE residents are keen to embrace the opportunities of digital services, with 8 out of 10 participants adamant they want their bank account opening process to be completely digital. And, despite 90% of participants saying they’re worried about the threat of fraud as banks become more digital, a massive 61% still use online banking in some form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The approach I take for several years now is to focus on what this means on the own device, in the personal life, and then to transfer to the business domain.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Everyone is receiving emails, from unknown people, from known people but with obscure email addresses, with strange topics, spelling errors, links or attachments. Demonstrating what to look at in this context, e.g., raises the interest of the audience and commonly triggers questions and discussions. Few samples from real life, both the personal life and the business life, help in increasing awareness and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of abstract rules, such concrete examples help, best by highlighting the fraudulent areas in such mails. From there to explaining “do a mouse-over across a link first, check the internet domain, and then – if all appears being safe, and only then – click the link (and only if there is a real value in doing so)” is a short step.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Another important element in my approach is to name the contacts to call when something looks strange, and to emphasize the importance of doing so instead of just acting by clicking links or opening attachments. Convince the team that no one ever has been blamed for asking. This is always better than making fundamental mistakes. Surely, the team has to react positively to the questions that will follow soon after the training (they are always raised, to my experience).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Last not least, you can add a little bit of tech content. My favorite subject here is explaining where in the Windows task bar to find the symbol with the current security status of the Windows system. This is a simple measure with very little effort that everyone can perform on a regular basis. If the symbol isn’t green, it then is about asking the experts.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>By the way: My trainings rarely take more than 15 minutes (unless a lot of questions occur, but that then is a good sign), and can be easily done in 5 minutes (without questions), as you can see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity_awareness_training">here</a> (at least if you understand German).</p>

<p>We have been talking with the EU about some research they are doing into the role of ‘smart contracts’ in data portability. We won’t go into the details of that particular discussion here, but it raised some bigger questions that we think are worth sharing. This is an edited version of a document we sent&nbsp;them.</p> Is the EU discussion about data portability missing a key&nbsp;point? <p>In its discussion of data portability the EU rightly recognises the economic importance of this issue, stressing that “market imbalances arising from the concentration of data restricts competition, increases market entry barriers and diminishes wider data access and&nbsp;use.”</p><p>However, the way it has framed the issue of ‘control’ of personal data renders the biggest breakthrough opportunities for economic transformation — in productivity, service quality and innovation — largely invisible.</p><p>Hidden in the details of data portability lies the potential for organisations to deposit ‘verified attributes’ or ‘verified credentials’ in individuals’ personal data stores (sometimes called ‘wallets). These verified attributes confirm data that has been carefully checked about individuals. Because they are cryptographically secure, they cannot be tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>When verified attributes are deposited in individuals’ personal data stores, it becomes possible for individuals to bring this pre-verified data with them to their dealings with other service providers. These other service providers can rely on this data without having to regenerate it or check&nbsp;it.</p><p>This process greatly speeds up completion of data-driven tasks and eliminates friction, effort, risk and cost from every step of personalised service provision across every service dealing with individuals, including public administration, financial services, health, education, retail, transport, media and&nbsp;leisure.</p><p>The closest economic parallel to this is the productivity revolution ushered in by Henry Ford’s moving assembly lines for the production of automobiles. Verified attributes are the standardised parts of service provision and personal data stores are the assembly lines. Ford reduced the costs of making a car by over 90%. Similar productivity breakthroughs in service provision are being made possible by the portability of verified attributes.</p><p>In addition, the ability to make individuals the point at which information about themselves is gathered is creating powerful new-to-the-world person-centric data assets. Currently, individuals’ data is dispersed across the hundreds of different organisations that collect data about them. Enabling this data to be unified in the individual’s personal data store, under the control of that individual, is creating a data source whose richness surpasses any data asset ever created — while fully protecting individuals’ privacy. The economic potential of these new person-centric data assets is&nbsp;immense.</p><p>As long as these two opportunities — of verified attributes and of individuals as the point of integration of their own data — remain overlooked, EU discussions about data portability and ‘control’ over data risk missing the economic opportunities that could be opened&nbsp;up.</p> Two meanings of ‘control’ <p>In this context, it is crucial that the EU recognises there are two distinct and different meanings to the word ‘control’ as it relates to individuals ‘controlling’ their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The first, very limited, meaning relates to individuals exercising more control over the data that organisations collect about them. The second, broader, more expansive meaning of control is individuals being able to collect, store, use and share their own data for their own purposes — to make better decisions and to manage their lives better — independently of any organisation that may be collecting data about them. This subsumes the first, limited meaning of ‘control’ as one small part of a much bigger&nbsp;process.</p><p>Only if the second, broader, more expansive meaning of the word ‘control’ is embraced will the full economic potential of data portability be unleashed.</p><p>In this context, focusing only on the first, narrow meaning of ‘control’ is very limiting. The real defining characteristic of PIMS (Personal Information Management Services) is not the issue of control (which is just a means to an end). It is individuals’ ability to use their own data for their own purposes, e.g. to manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>Two forms of portability</p><p>The two meanings of the word ‘control’ imply two different forms of data portability, requiring differing data sharing infrastructure.</p><p>A narrow, limited, interpretation of data portability assumes that data about an individual will be transferred from one data holding organisation to another. This is a strategic non-starter for two&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>First, it ignores the mathematics of networks which mean that, as such a system scales, it quickly generates a cost and complexity catastrophe. Figure 1 below illustrates this&nbsp;point.</p>Figure 1: A system of data sharing based on organisations passing data directly to each other quickly gets overcome by a cost and complexity catastrophe.<p>In a one-to-one data sharing network, as each new node joins the network the number of connections needed to connect them multiplies by the number of nodes in the network (whereas, it the sharing is done via a hub like a personal data store, adding a node adds just one new connection).</p><p>With a network of just three participants, direct sharing is fine. But with just eight participants, the number of connections that are needed has already jumped to 28. And by the time it gets to 50 participants, the number of connections needed has jumped to 1225 (whereas, with the individual’s personal data store at the centre, the number of connections that are needed has now risen to&nbsp;50).</p><p>This complexity catastrophe unfolds on multiple fronts, including:</p>  Security, as each organisation exposes its systems to other organisations  Interoperability, as each organisation has to learn how to deal with other organisations different software formats, standards, and so&nbsp;on.  Governance, as each organisation has to check whether another connecting organisation is bona fide, and really has permission to access the&nbsp;data  Data protection, as individuals lose sight of how holds their data for what&nbsp;purposes  <p>In short, a strategy for data sharing which simply extrapolates forward from today’s reliance on organisation-centric databases is a certain recipe for a catastrophically costly, toxic snarl-up.</p><p>At the same time, if this approach is adopted, individuals never have the opportunity to take control of their data as in the second, broader, more expansive meaning of the term. With organisation-centric data portability individuals are continually excluded from the workings of the data economy, which remain firmly in the hands of data holding organisations.</p><p>The second interpretation of data portability is where copies of the data held by organisations, (including verified attributes) are deposited in the individual’s personal data store, so that they can use their data independently of the organisation that originally generated this data. This requires new infrastructure — empowering individuals with their own personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>This second approach to data portability has been explicitly recognised by the EU — by the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on the right to data portability (5 April 2017) which stated&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“Data subjects should be enabled to make use of a personal data store, personal information management system31 or other kinds of trusted third-parties, to hold and store the personal data and grant permission to data controllers to access and process the personal data as required.”</blockquote><p>The take-out from this is simple. If the EU overlooks the pivotal importance of new enabling infrastructure for data sharing it risks a) sleepwalking into a data sharing complexity catastrophe and b) missing the true economic potential of data portability.</p> Distinctions between personal data stores and&nbsp;PIMS <p>The two interpretations of ‘control’ and the two forms of data portability as outlined above raise further questions about the EU’s understanding of the PIMS&nbsp;concept.</p><p>As stated above, in our view, the unique contribution of PIMS is to help individuals to use data to manage their lives better: the focus is on ‘use’. Examples of ‘using’ data may be making and implementing decisions about personal finances; managing a health condition better, or laying out a personal skills, training and career plan. All such services require data to be aggregated from many different service providers.</p><p>Personal data stores do not, per se, provide such services. They are personal data logistics enablers, providing the infrastructure that enables the necessary data collection, storage and data sharing for the provision of such services. A PDS enables data to be held by individuals independently of particular service providers and enables the maximum reuse of this data by many different services.</p><p>To that degree, we see personal data stores and PIMS as being part of the same movement towards citizen data empowerment but with different roles and functions — one enabling data access, the other helping better use of the data once it has been accessed. PIMS need personal data stores to function more efficiently (and if PDS infrastructure is not used, it will involve PIMS in huge amounts of extra, duplicated effort, the costs and complexity of which could stifle the growth of the&nbsp;sector).</p> Conclusion <p>The gist of our input was that the EU needs to build the full economic opportunity into its discussions about data portability. To do so, it needs to grasp the differences between two meanings of control and the two forms of data portability along with the need for new citizen empowering data infrastructure. Let’s see what they come up&nbsp;with.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-critical-fork-in-the-data-road-1eb29c5a42a8">A critical fork in the data road?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The world has been more digitized with the development of IT technology and the transition to a contactless society due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As many industries and environments become digitized, the digitization of money is also accelerating. From 1993 to 2022, over 100 CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency) projects were launched, and many countries are joining the race for CBDC development.</p><p>Here is an interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cizar-bachir-brahim-b8675817/">Cizar Bachir Brahim</a>, CSO of <a href="https://swnglobal.com/">Sovereign Wallet</a>, and one of the key players at <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/sovereign-wallet-expanding-cbdc-business-in-the-nordic-region-28cce9b5993f">Sovereign Wallet in expanding the CBDC business in the Nordic region</a>, about how CBDC development has been doing worldwide and the strengths of the Sovereign Wallet’s CBDC blockchain platform compared with other CBDC platforms.</p>Cizar Bachir Brahim, Chief Strategy Officer(CSO) of Sovereign Wallet<p>1. Please introduce yourself and the company Sovereign Wallet.</p><p>My Name is Cizar, and I’m the Chief Strategy Officer of Sovereign Wallet. I’m based in Stockholm-Sweden, overseeing the global market expansion to build a sustainable ecosystem for the company. Before introducing the company, let me give you a brief background of who I am and why I joined Sovereign Wallet two years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Before I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seokgu-phantom-yun/">Phantom</a> (the founder &amp; CEO of Sovereign Wallet), I was running several companies in investment mediation, innovation strategies, and business development for startups. I was also an academic researching innovation and entrepreneurship. I wrote the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Colony-Innovative-Startups-Practical-Policymakers/dp/9151958732">“Colony of Innovative Startups: A Practical Guide for Policymakers and Corporate Leaders”</a> published in early 2020. The book suggests an unorthodox way of building an ecosystem of innovative startups and proposes four main lessons to retain for the success&nbsp;formula:</p>  A company with a genius idea that can solve a real-world problem  A product with the ability to be sold to clients <br>(Customers-Based Business&nbsp;Model)  A vision to sustain through building its ecosystem.  Using futuristic technology (ex., Blockchain, DLT technology, etc.)  <p>For all four(04) criteria mentioned above, I could smell, touch, and identify during the 1st meeting with Phantom. Then, I started to be interested in Sovereign Wallet’s philosophy and technology, had more discussions with the company founders, and exchanged possible ways of collaboration; as time passed, I realized that I could add more value by being an insider and accepted the founder’s invitation to join the company, and here I have now joined the dream of Sovereign Wallet with a mission to build the internet of sovereign digital currencies and contribute to shaping the future of payment, a more transparent and inclusive financial system.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet has developed <a href="https://scan.metamui.id/dashboard">MetaMUI Blockchain</a>, the world’s first identity-based blockchain, the state-of-the-art fourth-generation blockchain with the main net launched on January 3rd, 2021. Sovereign Wallet’s headquarter (HQ) is located in Seoul, South Korea, and the company has four companies under the name “Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) Global,” present in Singapore, Sweden, India, and Uzbekistan.</p><p>The founder and CEO of Sovereign Wallet, Phantom Seokgu Yun, is one of the best security experts in the security expert. Before establishing Sovereign Wallet, he provided security software to the South Korean government and big corporations, including eBay Korea, Kakao, Samsung Electronics, Samsung Life Insurances, SK Telecom, LG Telecom, KOSCOM, Yahoo Japan, Rakuten, and many more. He also provided the security software during the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/seoul/">G20 Summit</a> in South Korea in&nbsp;2010.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet’s research partner is the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/rewriting-satoshi-company-and-uni-to-build-crypto-model-addressing-bitcoins-shortcomings">University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering</a>, led by <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Krishnamachari/Bhaskar">Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari</a> and <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Neuman/B">Prof. B. Clifford Neuman</a>. We’ve had a very successful collaboration over the past three years since 2019 and are continuing to achieve our strategic goals.</p><p>The company has six patents applied for and <a href="https://swnglobal.com/patent">18 patents acquired</a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seokgu-Yun">three academic papers</a> published at IEEE conferences.</p><p>2. Most companies in the blockchain industry mainly focus on developing NFT and Defi platforms, and many investors are interested in that too. What makes Sovereign Wallet focus on CBDC development?</p><p>Having CBDC development as the main focus of the Company’s strategy doesn’t mean we are not involved in developing futuristic solutions that will shape the financial and payment industry.</p><p>First, we are a fintech company with uniquely distinguished advanced technology. We believe we are already representing the 4th generation blockchain, and we are the world’s 1st identity-based blockchain.</p><p>To answer the question, we are not only focusing on CBDC, even though we are convinced that any future development in payments and banking should consider an operational digital currency system. That’s why CBDC deployment is fundamental, the reason why Sovereign Wallet is investing more resources to make our MetaMUI CBDC platform available by the end of this year. So any Central bank can explore and test its advanced features and run pilots on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another thing that I want to highlight is that the MetaMUI CBDC platform is not limited to digital currency issuance. It is considered an innovation platform enabling a sustainable digital ecosystem of innovations. Some DeFi features are already deployed on top of the MetaMUI platform, such as the National Identity System, e-Government services, and Digital Assets Tokenization which also covers green finance and carbon trading features.</p>“MetaMUI CBDC SSID”&nbsp;App<p>3. Many countries, including Sweden, Canada, France, Korea, etc., are developing their own CBDC platform. What is the reason they focus on the CBDC development so&nbsp;eagerly?</p><p>It is indeed an international movement, where <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cbdc/2022/cbdc-weekly-bis-says-90-central-banks-exploring-digital-currency-call-to-slow-down-digital-rupee-philippines-plans-q4-pilot-of-wholesale-cbdc/">almost 90% of Central banks have entered the CBDC race</a>, either in research, development, or potential pilot implementation.</p><p>To know the reasons behind this movement, we must dive deeper into understanding the current transformations in the global financial system. An aging system with over 100 years of existence is characterized by multiple hits, crises, and serious threats. It is now trying to adapt to unstable circumstances to remain operational. However, the past century witnessed similar attempts to reform/change every time a major crisis hits the financial system: from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">1929 great depression</a> to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">Breton Woods Agreement</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock">Nixon shock in 1971</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis">1997 Asian financial crisis</a>, which was followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2008 global financial crisis</a> until the 2020 covid pandemic… to name few — adding to that two particular threats triggered an alarming situation among central bankers, digitalization, and the increasing adaptation of cryptocurrencies globally.</p><p>All the circumstances mentioned above are the main drivers for a global reflection toward finding sustainable remedies to the aging global financial system.</p><p>That’s why we are seeing the central banking community worldwide joining the efforts to seriously consider Central Bank Digital Currencies(CBDCs), which might be one of the valuable solutions to build a better, resilient, sustainable, and futuristic financial system.</p><p>It might be relevant to mention that what we live today in the CBDC era is not completely new. A quick look in history shows that similar initiatives aimed to have a digital form of money that replaces cash: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor">BANCOR</a> of 1945, for example, was the 1st attempt to create a digital currency for international transactions. Thousands of cryptocurrencies are trying to replace the existing financial establishment outside the banking and financial system.</p><p>I cannot predict how the war between the two worlds (Cryptocurrencies vs. Sovereign Digital Currencies) will end. Still, I’m convinced that the international financial community is working hard to reform the current financial system and build a better, more inclusive, transparent, and resilient financial system.</p><p>Through the genius invention of its MetaMUI CBDC, Sovereign Wallet is joining the global effort and aiming to contribute to building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies.</p><p>4. Sovereign Wallet opened its subsidiary office in Stockholm, Sweden. Could you share with us the current CBDC market situation in the Nordic region and what is your plan and strategy to expand the CBDC business in the Nordic&nbsp;region?</p><p>First of all, I would instead ask the following question: why specifically Sweden and not other Nordic countries?</p><p>The answer is pretty simple: Sweden is the largest Nordic country and a well-connected economy, and when it comes to financing and banking, the Swedish Central Bank (Sveriges Riksbank, or simply the Riksbank) is the world’s oldest central bank, founded in 1668. When it comes to CBDCs, the Riksbank experience is the most outstanding example so far. <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona/">The research on CBDC started in 2017, and the e-Krona pilot launched in 2020</a>. However, no decision has been made yet on whether an e-Krona publication- is suitable for the nearest&nbsp;future.</p><p>For Sovereign Wallet, being present in Sweden allows us to interact with the Riksbank and explore possible ways of introducing the MetaMUI CBDC platform, testing its features, and ensuring a continuous enhancement of the platform services.</p><p>Another reason for choosing Sweden, particularly Stockholm, is the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub(BISIH) Nordics. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/16/bis-launches-innovation-hub-with-nordic-central-banks-focusing-on-cbdcs/">The BISIH Nordics was launched in June 2021</a> and gathered all four Nordics Central Banks in one place. This is the perfect opportunity for Sovereign Wallet to bring MetaMUI technology up front and introduce it to the representatives of four Central Banks (the Riksbank, the Norges Bank, the Icelandic Central Bank, and the Danish Nationalbanken).</p><p>Sovereign Wallet had a very fruitful discussion with the BISIH Nordics during the past months. We hope to resume these talks this month and pave the way for a fruitful collaboration between MetaMUI and the BISIH&nbsp;Nordics.</p>SWN Global Sweden, located at the ‘Epicenter Stockholm.’<p>5. China succeeded in commercializing its non-blockchain-based CBDC called “e-CNY.” What is the difference between blockchain-based CBDC and non-blockchain-based CBDC?</p><p>It is evident that the Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_renminbi">e-CNY</a>, also known as the “Digital Yuan,” is a non-blockchain-based form of digital currency issuance. Let’s look into its early development to understand its differentiation from the current CBDCs.- The e-CNY project’s official name is “Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP)” even the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) made it clear from the beginning that this is an electronic form of payment, somehow similar to digital banking. When exploring the operationality of the e-CNY, we must highlight an import feature as described by the PBOC: <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-launches-digital-yuan-app-what-you-need-to-know/">“The e-CNY is a digitized version of China’s legal currency, the renminbi (RMB). It is issued by China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). It is designed mainly for high-frequency, small-scale retail purchases and transactions.”</a></p><p>The statement above underlines that the entire project focuses on enhancing payments and improving digitalization, which in my opinion, is very close to an open banking / digital banking kind of&nbsp;system.</p><p>However, a CBDC description has a much broader explanation of the Central Bank’s role while issuing a digital currency, which closely imitates cash issuance and monetary policy elaborations.</p><p>In short, a CBDC would preferably maintain the classical role of a Central Bank as the country’s sovereign authority that oversees the national monetary policy and offers a digital form of money that covers most cash characteristics.</p><p>To compare with blockchain-based CBDC. MetaMUI technology is completely different! MetaMUI is the world’s first identity-based blockchain. It uses a hybrid system of high-performance digital cash and high-security digital checks. This hybrid architecture allows MetaMUI’s blockchain to be used in global-scale applications, including central banks, digital stock issuance, digital currency exchanges, non-fungible tokens, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>MetaMUI utilizes an indigenous multi-ledger architecture, meaning each digital currency generated on MetaMUI Blockchain will have its blockchain ledger. We also offer a pre-built identity blockchain and digital asset blockchain. Our node system consists of Bank nodes and Mobile&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>The MetaMUI CBDC platform offers the possibility of issuing Central Bank Digital Currencies in the most secure and technologically advanced&nbsp;way.</p><p>6. What are the differences between public blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos, Algorand, etc., and the MetaMUI Blockchain?</p><p>We’ve developed solutions significantly ahead of other enterprise blockchains in scalability and compliance, making us the ideal technology choice for a country-wide CBDC implementation.</p><p>MetaMUI is not the only platform offering blockchain-based digital currency issuance. However, our extensive research and advanced development have provided us many advantages over other enterprise blockchain platforms. The main competitors in this field would be R3 Corda, Enterprise Ethereum, Bitt, G+D, Ripple, and Hyperledger projects — including Hyperledger Fabric.</p><p>However, broad-usage enterprise blockchains still run into performance issues. They are not built specifically for financial applications and are neither made to accommodate wide-scale adoption. An Ethereum-based solution or other existing enterprise blockchains would not be sufficiently scalable for countrywide implementation.</p><p>Remember that the <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_transactions_per_day">public Ethereum blockchain only supports up to 1.1~1.2 million daily transactions</a>, and any major scaling increases are currently not foreseen.</p><p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/02/architecture-hyperledger-fabric/">Hyperledger Fabric is benchmarked at up to 3,500 transactions per second(TPS)</a>. However, it does not include any identity integrations, and the peak benchmark numbers are currently only possible in a fully controlled environment. The approach to scale by utilizing channels has some major concerns. We have identified that Hyperledger Fabric is unlikely to scale sufficiently for a real-world CBDC implementation due to the number of channels required to be established and other technical factors.</p><p>In short, no blockchain platform other than MetaMUI can offer identity-based transfers, which are the core of a legally valid CBDC issuance. We also provide far higher scalability thanks to our hybrid model, which sets us far ahead of any other blockchain solution provider for this use&nbsp;case.</p><p>As the other enterprise blockchains are built for broader use cases and are not financial-specific, we are uniquely positioned to be the primary choice for any country that wants to expedite its central bank digital currency issuance and not rely on time-consuming and expensive custom developments to build one from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>7. Lastly, please tell us how you view the future of CBDC and the mid-to-long-term roadmap and vision of Sovereign Wallet.</p><p>Let me start with the Sovereign Wallet roadmap, which covers the MetaMUI expansion strategy for the coming years. We plan to strengthen our presence in Europe and the Nordics region to get MetaMUI technology involved in many digital payments-related projects. We are reaching advanced stages in talks with the BISIH Nordics to take part in two important projects for the Nordic payment ecosystem (Project Aurora and Project Polaris). We multiply our efforts on the digital euro project through a strategic partnership with the Digital Euro Association and other regional stakeholders.</p><p>Another direction that MetaMUI is preparing to head for the end of this year is the GCC region(Gulf Cooperation Council); we have already appointed exclusive agents representing Sovereign Wallet in all GCC regions (KSA, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain). A subsidiary company is planned to be established in one of the GCC countries. Stay tuned for the good&nbsp;news.</p><p>In summary, we will see MetaMUI achieving interesting milestones during 2023 and contributing significantly to building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies (IoSDC).</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that yesterday KILT became the first parachain to relocate from Kusama to Polkadot. The stability and bank-level security of Polkadot allow KILT to provide practical, secure decentralized identity solutions for individuals, builders, and large-scale enterprise use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>At 20:15 CEST on Monday 3 October, KILT built its first block on Polkadot following the last block on Kusama and is now running as a Polkadot parachain. This milestone opens up a whole new phase for KILT. It is now production-ready for applications that need a more secure environment, and for large-scale enterprises that require the stability and scalability provided by Polkadot.</p><p>KILT Coin holders don’t need to do anything differently — all KILT transactions were stopped when the move started and all data, including KILT Coin balances on the KILT blockchain, remain safe and secure. All services built on KILT are unchanged and can be used as&nbsp;before.</p> One Chain, One&nbsp;Coin <p>Following the original plan of “one chain, one coin”, KILT became the first blockchain in the ecosystem to move in its entirety from Kusama to Polkadot. This means that all the KILT Coins and data on KILT/Kusama are now on KILT/Polkadot. There will only ever be one KILT Coin, and all credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and web3names previously issued on KILT are still valid. This was possible thanks to Polkadot’s groundbreaking technology.</p><p>To facilitate the move to Polkadot, the KILT community held a referendum to approve the required runtime changes. The referendum also granted the KILT Council additional rights to facilitate the relocation without restoring the Sudo (super user) key, keeping KILT decentralized throughout the process. This referendum passed with 100% agreement.</p><p>The KILT team did rigorous pre-testing, then the final phases of relocation started under the direction of the KILT Council. Transfers were disabled for the duration of the move. Finally the KILT/Kusama chain was stopped by swapping it with a new paraID on Kusama. This produced the finite, last Kusama&nbsp;block.</p><p>Using the “Solo-to-parachain” pallet developed by Parity Technologies, KILT was then relocated to Polkadot and started producing blocks on October 3. We’re very thankful to the Parity core developers for their support of the KILT team throughout the&nbsp;move.</p><p>A full report will follow soon with the technical details and phases of the relocation. The documentation and learnings will help other Kusama parachains that wish to relocate to Polkadot in the&nbsp;future.</p> Path to&nbsp;Polkadot <p>KILT launched as a Kusama parachain in September 2021 as a blockchain identity protocol for generating self-sovereign decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials. On November 10th of the same year, governance moved into the hands of the community of KILT Coin holders and KILT became a fully decentralized blockchain. Since then, KILT has gone from strength to strength. Thanks to the fast iterations possible on Kusama, significant new functionality was integrated into the KILT&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>You can now build your own decentralized digital identity, under your control, with these applications “Built on&nbsp;KILT”:</p>  <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> — a wallet for KILT Coins and credentials (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Create-KILT-Sporran-Identity.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://stakeboard.kilt.io/">Stakeboard</a> — a staking platform for backing KILT collators with KILT Coins (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_Stakeboard.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> — an identity verification service for social media credentials (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_SocialKYC_Credentials.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign</a> — a decentralized way to sign any digital file directly in your browser (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_DIDsign.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://w3n.id/">web3name</a> — a unique name for your digital identity that can be used across ecosystems and linked with addresses and credentials.

Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moofushi_Kandu_fish.jpg">Bruno de Giusti CC-BY-SA-2.5</a> 1. Introduction <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum and others have shown how you can reward those who add value to the ecosystem in a highly automated fashion [1]. The trick is to auto-dispense rewards to those who contribute to a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/can-blockchains-go-rogue-5134300ce790">precisely-defined objective function</a>. This is an efficient, scalable approach to allocate capital towards&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Good news! Data Farming turns this into reality for the Ocean ecosystem, with the “maximize data consume volume” objective function. veOCEAN’s ve-based locking mechanics and protocol revenue to ve holders round this out to make OceanDAO much more automated (beyond&nbsp;grants).</p><p>So, OceanDAO’s been evolving. Where might it further evolve? DAOs of other Web3 projects have chosen to have general governance over protocol parameters and treasury spending. We had been seriously considering growing OceanDAO’s scope similarly. However, something nagged at us. We felt uneasy since we knew heavier governance meant larger attack surface. But, was that all just worrywart theory, or could it actually&nbsp;happen?</p><p>Recent events point to the latter. First, a regulatory agency ruled that members were liable for their DAO’s actions. Second, small groups of 1–3 actors control many large DAOs, such as Coinbase in MakerDAO (capture).</p><p>Furthermore, any governance also keeps Ocean away from its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">network goals</a> to be censorship-resistant and trustless. Finally, the core team spends large time &amp; mental effort every month in making DAO grants happen; this has opportunity cost to other traction initiatives.</p><p>Given the risks and costs, does OceanDAO actually need governance? Let’s explore. First, as of V4, Ocean’s core smart contracts are highly flexible; they offer a vast space to explore business models. Ocean doesn’t need DAO governance for its core functionality. Second, as discussed, veOCEAN and Data Farming provide a means to reward those who add value to the ecosystem without governance or&nbsp;grants.</p><p>Overall, Ocean will be more resilient, more scalable and more capital efficient if it is fully decentralized and autonomous (D&amp;A).</p><p>Therefore in coming months, we will make this&nbsp;happen.</p><p>This means:</p>  We will wind down OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.  We will automate &amp; decentralize the rest of veOCEAN and Data Farming&nbsp;(DF).  OceanDAO grants’ budget will shift fully to Data Farming. There is now 503.4M $OCEAN allocated to DF&nbsp;rewards.  <p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 elaborates on OceanDAO grants wind-down. Section 3 describes how we will make veOCEAN and DF to be D&amp;A. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. OceanDAO Grants Wind-Down  2.1 Timeline <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-22-is-live-91e0187db298">OceanDAO Grants Round 22</a> will complete. This has $65K USD worth of OCEAN available, including $10K to Algovera grants program. Proposals are due in early October, with voting the week&nbsp;after.</p><p>OceanDAO Grants Round 23 will complete. This is $45K USD worth of OCEAN available, including $10K to Algovera grants program. Proposals are due in early November, with voting the week&nbsp;after.</p><p>Then, OceanDAO Grants will&nbsp;stop.</p> 2.2 Funding Redirection <p>We will shift the remaining 3% of the 51% from grants to DF. This increases the total $OCEAN available for DF rewards from 481.8M $OCEAN to 503.4M&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p> 2.3 Grants&nbsp;FAQs <p>Q: Will veOCEAN be used for voting in grants round 22 or&nbsp;23?</p><p>A: No. It’s not worth implementing, given that it would only be used for such a short&nbsp;period.</p><p>Q: Will OceanDAO Core Tech WG continue?</p><p>A: Yes. Its emphasis will be around technical collaboration within the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Q: Will the monthly 10K $USD to Algovera-curated grants continue?</p><p>A: Yes. It will come directly from OPF to Algovera.</p><p>Q: I really rely on grants! What should I&nbsp;do?</p><p>A: See the next section “Your sustainable Ocean&nbsp;project”</p> 2.4 Your Sustainable Ocean&nbsp;project <p>If you’ve been getting or considering grants via OceanDAO: consider this as us redirecting you to the other ways to earn in the Ocean ecosystem.</p>  Rewards via Ocean Data Farming and veOCEAN. Lock OCEAN into veOCEAN for passive rewards; for even higher rewards, actively allocate your veOCEAN to assets with high data consume volume. The more you lock, the more you earn. The longer you lock for, the more you earn. The higher the consume volume, the more you earn.<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">&nbsp;Details</a>.  Ocean Shipyard program, which gives grants for builders. Shipyard is curated and managed by the Ocean core team.<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">&nbsp;Details</a>.  Sell data or scripts/algorithms. Ocean’s designed to reduce friction on this, and we keep improving it! This could be raw data, scripts to clean data, cleaned data itself, scripts to compute feature vectors, feature vectors themselves, scripts to build AI models, AI models themselves, scripts to run predictions from AI models, or predictions themselves. Each of these can be an asset in&nbsp;Ocean.  Use Ocean data/algorithms to make predictions, to make money. For example, to help in DeFi&nbsp;trading.  Use Ocean in your startup’s stack. You may be a business selling data/algorithms; building a dapp or service; or building your own decentralized protocol. For all of these, Ocean tools can help you ship sooner with more functionality. Then, use the usual startup financing: investors, revenue,&nbsp;etc.   3. Making DF/VE Decentralized &amp; Autonomous  3.1 Review of&nbsp;DF/VE <p>We recently launched veOCEAN, where one locks OCEAN to get veOCEAN. Locking for longer means more veOCEAN, which in turn means more rewards. One can earn more rewards yet by curating data assets that have high data consume volume. veOCEAN holders also get a cut of protocol revenue, which increases with data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>These mechanics incentivize growing DCV, and form a strong backbone for Ocean’s sustainability loop.</p> 3.2 D&amp;A Status of&nbsp;DF/VE <p>Here are key components of DF/VE, and their D&amp;A&nbsp;status.</p>  veOCEAN core. The contracts to lock OCEAN into veOCEAN are deployed on Ethereum mainnet. They are already D &amp;&nbsp;A.  Passive rewards. The contracts to compute &amp; dispense passive rewards to veOCEAN holders are deployed on Ethereum mainnet. They are already D &amp;&nbsp;A.  Active rewards. Data Farming is currently run as a python script that reads on-chain data (veOCEAN balances, asset DCV) and computes rewards, off-chain.  Funding rewards. Every week, the Ocean core team manually triggers on-chain actions to fund both passive rewards and active&nbsp;rewards.  <p>The first two components are already&nbsp;D&amp;A.</p><p>Now, for the remaining two. The Ocean core team has made detailed plans to make these D&amp;A as well.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes Nation State Actors so special compared to other threat actors?</p>
<p>I think it's important to understand the differences between the different threat actor groups, I think is super important for a CISO. Those are usually seen as the following. We have the insiders, on the one hand, the attack comes from the inside. So it's an employee which intentionally, accidentally or abused from the outside helps on an attack. We've seen this in the Ukraine situation. So latest since then, this is a concern. The second group that CISOs are concerned about is the hacktivist, so usually following a special ideology or sympathizing with the specific side in a conflict. And again, this is what we've seen massively during the Ukraine war, for example. The classic group that CISOs are concerned about is the organized crime groups, the professionals. They are usually after the money. They have different maturities, so, for example, from ransomware to sophisticated payment fraud attacks and they're getting better over time and the last group actually is the one which is subject to this exercise. And this is the nation-state level attacks. The nation-state levels are characterized by vast resources they have to use for their attacks potentially. And in worst case, they have lots of patients. So we've seen in nation state-level attacks which are going over more than a year, for example. So they are able to launch very sophisticated attacks. They use their intelligence organizations and there are special cyber forces in the countries. And they have lots of tools and techniques and they have very, very special and sometimes even unique knowledge. So we know that the nation states usually collect the knowledge on zero-day exploits. So these are vulnerabilities which aren't yet publicly known, and they obviously can then be used in an attack once and once they've been published, then they get pitched sooner or later. And that's what we've seen in a couple of nation-state attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the main countries we are concerned about and what are their motives?</p>
<p>So the countries you will most likely hear about most often in the context of nation state cyber attacks are typically North Korea, you hear about China, you hear about Russia and you hear about Iran. And however, if you look at the threat landscape report of the different intelligence organizations globally, then you will find out there are far more names on their respective lists and some of the countries are actually very surprising to us. All well-known countries or even what we would call “on our side”, so to speak. We've seen that many nation states in the last few years were ramping up their cyber capabilities significantly. So I think this is seen as a basic capability of all modern countries to have cyber defense and in some cases even cyber offense operations capabilities. So in some countries, we see a relatively open discussion is being held on if and which offensive actions would be allowed. But I would say in most countries, actually, it's pretty non-transparent. Which cyber operations are being carried out by the nation-state where the citizen actually is living in. And when you look at the different cyber operations carried out, this very much depends on the motives and the priorities of the respective country. So we see in some cases it's just monetary income. Is the motive for North Korea, for example, they are very much interested in money.</p>
<p>In most cases, you see an interest in industry knowledge. So, espionage, for example, the classic country we think about here comes from Asia. It's for example, China. But here again, many, many countries are doing this actually, even ones we would attribute to the “western” side. Others again, have motives on destruction or to reduce the stability of the country. So, for example, attacking critical infrastructure, I think of, for example, about the Stuxnet attack a couple of years back against the nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the best way to defend against a nation-state-backed attack?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mentioned that the nation states actually are able to carry out very sophisticated attacks. However, we have seen, and this applies, for example, for the attacks we've analyzed during the Ukraine war, that many of the attacks comprise of standard techniques, like, for example, phishing or spear phishing emails, so targeted emails or the abuse of known and public available volatilities. Which just need to have patched on internet-facing applications. So, the basic thing which is always advisable is basic hygiene, like awareness, the understanding of phishing emails and not clicking a link, and especially not entering the credentials then on the fake website which opens up. We talk about multi-factor authentication, I think this is a baseline capability. Patching is super important, and we see increasing importance for structural capabilities such as network segmentation, which can help. But we know that the capable nation-state, if they really want to get into an organization, then it's super difficult to have an effective defense against this. I mean, CISOs know for a while already, there’s never 100% security. So regardless of how sophisticated you tailor your organization, your security organization, there may be a more sophisticated attack, which reaches your perimeter, your defense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Ukraine war cyber threats got increased public attention. What incidents have we seen?</p>
<p>So during the Ukraine war, real nation-state level attacks we've seen primarily among the directly involved countries. So we've seen such attacks in Russia and Ukraine and a little bit in Belarus as well. We have been super vigilant when the NATO application of Sweden and Finland came up, especially for the organizations in the Nordics. But, and this the good news, we've not seen related cyber activities directly attributable to NATO application. Jens Stoltenberg warned very publicly and I think he just repeated it as an earlier sentence, and Biden stressed this as well, he warned Russia indirectly with a sentence that is, A cyber attack against a NATO country may invoke Article 5, which actually says that this is an attack against a NATO ally, which leads to the consequence to the other countries and other NATO allies will help and defend that country accordingly. So on the nation-state side, I would say we've not seen that much. We've seen more, plenty of attacks actually, from hacktivists on both sides. These were primarily distributed denial of service attacks, for example, against organizations still doing business in Russia, was one example. But we've not seen very serious attacks on that side. And in many cases, the attacks cannot be clearly attributed back to a specific threat actor or to the nation-state or to hacktivists fighting with one side.</p>
<p>So I've had calls with a couple of CISOs who had a DDoS attack, and they of course, have a range of IP addresses from where the attacks predominately came, which is then obviously botnets or something like that. But it cannot be clearly attributed back to who is now the one who was paying for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has the Ukraine war the potential to change the cyber threat landscape in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mentioned that more countries are actually investing into their cyber capabilities. Now, especially in the Ukraine situation. Look at the Germans, for example, parts of their significant ramp-up of funding for the armed forces, which will go into cyber capabilities. And we made experiences in the past that it's just a matter of time until these capabilities, tools, techniques or even knowledge on zero days will leak down and may then be used and abused by organized crime groups afterwards. The most famous leak, most likely was the Shadow Brokers leak from I think it was 2016, and the Shadow Brokers is hacking group and they actually made a couple of tools and data about zero-day vulnerabilities publicly available. And it's obvious that this data and these threats came from a group which is called the Equation Group. And we believe that this can be, that they belong to the National Security Agency in the United States, so the NSA. And there's a link again, I mean the nation-state tools do know what they will leak. That means practically, the Ukraine war has the potential to accelerate the evolving landscape even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who should attend the round table discussion and what can attendees expect?</p>
<p>I think the nation-state topic is a super, super interesting topic for everybody who is concerned about security in an organization. Of course, cyber security, the most prominent one. But this goes even into the area of physical security and executive protection. I would say that especially CISOs, (Chief) Security Officers, security experts and other people besides us who are interested in the topic are well advised actually to attend this exercise. I think participants can expect a good discussion on this topic and that we all sharpen our understanding of what we can do and potentially when is good good enough or where even actions crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your expectations in terms of the round table discussions?</p>
<p>I think especially in the last few years, collaboration, intelligence, and experience sharing among the, I call them “the good guys”, became a capability of increasing importance. So I'm always delighted if I have experienced people in a room discussing options for a topic like this one which is not so easy and where a silver bullet is not so obvious or perhaps even not existing.</p>

				 <p>Check out the latest episode of <a href="https://northernblock.io/">Northern Block</a>‘s <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a>! In this episode, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieuglaude/">Mathieu Glaude</a> welcomes our own Darrell O’Donnell to discuss the importance of Trust Registries.</p>
<p>In SSI ecosystems, a Trust Registry is a valuable tool that tells you where to go to get answers to help you make trust-based decisions. They can help answer questions like: do I trust the things involved enough to achieve what I want in any interaction?&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>During the conversation, Darrell discusses the role of Trust Registries in decentralized identity (SSI) ecosystems, how they help establish the authenticity of data and who benefits the most within the Trust Triangle. He also shares his thoughts on adopting Trust Registries and how they will play a significant role within SSI ecosystems.</p>
<p>We want to extend a special thank you to Mathieu Glaude at Northern Block for asking Darrell to be on the show. We are thrilled to continue to promote Trust Registry technology and its incorporation into decentralized identity ecosystems.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — September 26th to October&nbsp;2nd <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We have brought some of the hottest news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from the Bank of England Governor’s statement on bringing digital assets under the existing financial regulatory framework to Paraguayan lawmakers rejecting the president’s veto of the crypto bill. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> BoE Deputy Governor Wants Existing Financial Regulations to Extend to&nbsp;Crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/AFME_EU/status/1575041150029012994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Image Source</a><p>Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said financial regulations should be extended to cryptocurrencies before the industry becomes large enough to potentially threaten broader financial stability during the Operations, Post Trade, Technology, and Innovation Conference in&nbsp;London.</p><blockquote>“Regulators need to begin extending existing standards and regulatory regimes to crypto before, not after it becomes systemically important,” Cunliffe said. “And done carefully, the development of regulatory regimes helps, not hinders, innovation by reducing the risks of confidence destroying crashes and by giving innovators a framework within which to innovate.”</blockquote><p>Despite flagging these risks, Cunliffe also praised the underlying technology, saying that even bigwigs like HSBC are investing and experimenting in it due to its potentially game-changing impact on banking operations.</p> Uzbekistan Green Lights New Legislation to Make VASPs Shell Out Fixed Monthly&nbsp;Fees <a href="https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220527000553">Image Source</a><p>As per the new legislation authored by the National Agency of Perspective Projects (NAPP) under the President of Uzbekistan, crypto firms in Uzbekistan will now have to pay monthly fees to the&nbsp;state.</p><p>For instance, crypto exchanges will be charged the highest tariff of 120 million Uzbekistani soum (worth almost $11,000), while custodial service providers will enjoy the lowest fee at just $135. On the other hand, Crypto stores will pay around $540 per month, individual miners will have to shell out $270 per month, and mining pools will have to pay $2700 per&nbsp;month.</p><p>And any VASPs that fail to comply with this legislation will be penalized, which may range from license suspension to cancelation.</p> US Senators Introduced a Bill to Bring Crypto Companies Under Cybersecurity Framework <p>U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) have introduced the Cryptocurrency Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act to help crypto companies report cybersecurity threats.</p><p>The bill will provide a voluntary mechanism for crypto companies to report bad actors. It seeks to mitigate losses from crypto-related incidents, including network damage, business interruption, data breaches, and ransomware attacks.</p><p>According to Sen. Blackburn, “some bad actors have used cryptocurrency as a way to hide their illegal practices and avoid accountability.”</p><p>But that is about to change once this bill comes into force, as it “will update existing regulations to address this misuse directly.”</p> Paraguay Lawmakers Reject President’s Veto <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/university-in-paraguay-will-take-tuition-payments-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum/">Image Source</a><p>A total of 33 Paraguayan lawmakers have rejected <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining?utm_campaign=Shyft%20%26%20Veriscope%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">President Mario Abdo Benitez’s veto </a>of a major Bitcoin mining regulation bill.</p><p>Paraguay’s legislature approved the bill in July to create a tax and regulatory framework regulating Bitcoin mining in the South American country. But the president vetoed it, claiming mining uses high amounts of energy but brings relatively small employment benefits.</p><p>According to a release from the country’s Congress, the bill would benefit the Latin American nation by bringing in income through mining taxes, creating “new forms of employment,” and tracking the energy consumption of crypto&nbsp;miners.</p><p>The bill will now be passed to the National Deputy chamber, which will decide to reject or approve the presidential veto. If rejected, the bill will finally be sanctioned.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1575878765363793922?s=20&amp;t=Uwv_evLzaHD-AEmNQ-7Srg">Image Source</a><p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope.

<p>Da oggi è disponibile il nuovo selfcare InfoCert ID, la pagina personale dedicata a tutti gli utenti SPID InfoCert ID tramite la quale è possibile visualizzare e modificare i dati relativi alla propria Identità Digitale.</p>



<p>Grazie alla nuova interfaccia, moderna, intuitiva e pensata per rendere più semplice anche l’accesso da mobile, gli utenti SPID InfoCert, potranno gestire in tutte le principali funzioni per configurare e modificare le informazioni attinenti la propria identità digitale.</p>



<p>Dal selfcare InfoCert ID è possibile:</p>



  Gestire e modificare i tuoi dati, i documenti di identità e le informazioni di contatto;  Gestire i codici OTP e le modalità di ricezione tramite APP, sms o dispositivo hardware  Consultare la cronologia degli accessi  Sospendere o revocare le proprie credenziali SPID  



<p>Il nuovo selfcare inoltre è già pronto per gestire lo <a href="https://futurodigitale.infocert.it/tecnologie-digitali/spid-identita-digitale/cose-e-come-fare-lo-spid-per-i-minorenni/">SPID minori</a> – disponibile prossimamente – per il quale sarà possibile anche monitorare e gestire all’interno dello stesso pannello di controllo, l’utenza del minorenne o dei minorenni associati alla propria identità digitale.</p>



 Il successo di SPID InfoCert ID 



<p>Nel corso degli ultimi anni sempre più persone hanno attivato la propria identità digitale, sia per usufruire dei servizi online offerti dalle amministrazioni italiane o dai paesi europei che hanno aderito al nodo eIDAS, ma anche per accedere ai servizi delle imprese private che hanno scelto lo SPID come strumento di autenticazione per l’accesso ai propri servizi.</p>



<p>Dalla sua introduzione nel 2015, sono ormai più di <a href="https://avanzamentodigitale.italia.it/it/progetto/spid">32 milioni</a> gli utenti che utilizzano le credenziali SPID, in questo scenario InfoCert si attesta fra i maggiori Service Provider italiani ed europei, vantando un numero elevato di utenti attivi sia che ne facciano un uso da privati cittadini che per le proprie esigenze professionali. Inoltre, a breve sarà anche fra i primi gestori di identità digitale ad erogare lo <a href="https://futurodigitale.infocert.it/tecnologie-digitali/spid-identita-digitale/cose-e-come-fare-lo-spid-per-i-minorenni/">SPID per minorenni</a>, una nuova applicazione del sistema pubblico di identità digitale, la quale dovrebbe essere lanciata entro la fine del 2022.</p>

<p>What are behavioral biometrics? Behavioral biometrics analyzes a user’s physical movements and patterns while partaking in certain activities like typing, walking or even how much pressure is used while interacting with technology.</p>
<p>Behavioral biometrics measures and analyzes unique human traits such as physical movements and patterns while also partaking in certain activities like typing, walking or even how much pressure is used while interacting with technology. Some have termed it a “sister science” to physical biometrics, which measures physical traits like fingerprints. I should know because I began my identity journey writing operating systems for Payflex smartcard readers and developing fingerprint hashing schemes for secure storage and fast recall.<br>
But two decades and some change later, the science of behavioral biometrics has garnered the full attention of the identity management industry. Security vulnerabilities, transaction fraud, forgery, identity theft have left all market sectors scrambling to find a “proper” threat detection solution.</p>
 Why Are Biometrics Important to Authentication? 
<p>Almost all modern cybersecurity frameworks and regulations include, in some form, a call to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen identity verification and system access. MFA, as part of a broader <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/identity-management/what-is-iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM) strategy</a>, heightens security around authentication because it requires more from users than just a fragile and stealable password.</p>
<p>MFA schemas will typically require users to provide at least two forms of identification from different categories of authentication:</p>
 
 Knowledge: Something that the user knows or has memorized, such as a password, PIN, or passphrase associated with a question. 
 Ownership: Something that the user owns and should hold possession of. This can include sending a One-Time Password (OTP) to the user’s phone or email address or asking for an OTP from the user’s linked password authentication app. 
 Inherence: Something the user is. This is the category of biometrics of all types. 
 
<p>With the increasing popularity of devices, including biometric scanners (cameras and fingerprint scanners being the most common), biometrics has become a default form of MFA and passwords.</p>
 What Are Behavioral Biometrics? 
<p>Biometrics can short-circuit attempted attacks, mainly phishing hacks, and provide a solid level of security for consumers and enterprises supporting apps and network access for their employees.</p>
<p>Biometrics, as a category, isn’t monolithic. Different types of biometrics refer to different parts of human physiology, addressing their inherent usefulness as an identity verification medium.</p>
<p>The primary categories of biometrics are:</p>
 
 Biological: Traits that are part of human physiology, intractable and usually require some sort of invasive collection method. This can include blood samples and DNA signatures. 
 Morphological: Visible traits that are unique and relatively easy to check for, even if they are somewhat vulnerable to damage. These include facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and iris scans. 
 Behavioral: Patterns of behavior we build over time, often unconsciously, as part of our daily lives. Can include voice patterns, handwriting styles, and gait patterns. 
 
<p>Each of these particular biometrics support authentication to some degree.</p>
<p>Biometrics like DNA signatures are perhaps the most unique and, thus, the most secure, even though they are an extreme way to guarantee security outside the most high-stakes environments.</p>
<p>Morphological traits are the most common forms of biometric authentication, often coupled with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">biometric passwords</a> for MFA or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> systems.</p>
<p>Behavioral is a rising conversation in the field. As advances in AI and machine learning fuel accurate interpretations of behaviors beyond what was thought possible, very common traits can be used to analyze a user’s activity and determine authentication and authorization.</p>
 What Are Different Forms of Behavioral Biometrics? 
<p>Throughout the 20th century, experts sought ways to nail down behavioral characteristics that could prove helpful in authentication or identity verification. However, most of these experts never really knew how deep such authentication efforts could go in using esoteric mannerisms as unique markers for individuals.</p>
<p>Some of the more exciting forms of behavioral biometrics used today include:</p>
 Body Movement 
<p>Modern machines have become adept at using physical movements to determine an individual’s identity. Many people aren’t aware that we all have fairly unique shapes and movement patterns across dozens of measurement points. Modern AI can use posture and weight distribution or gait and walking patterns to determine if someone is who they say they are.</p>
 Gesture Recognition 
<p>Researchers have discovered that people often do the smallest things with specific patterns and cadences. Typing on a keyboard, tapping on a screen, moving a mouse cursor, and more all fall under this category.</p>
 Handwriting Recognition 
<p>Unsurprisingly, however, is using handwriting to identify someone. Handwriting experts have been around forever, but handwriting forgers have been around for just as long. An authentication system powered by AI can identify genuine and fake handwriting far beyond the capacity of human investigators.</p>
 User Behavior 
<p>This category may not seem like a biometric. Still, anti-fraud experts have been using browsing and shopping patterns from online consumers to power machine learning algorithms that can pick up on suspicious behavior that could potentially flag theft. While these behaviors are all in the digital world, they are considered biometrics precisely because they are tied to patterns that most don’t even know we display.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Behavioral Biometrics? 
<p>Biometrics are the foundation of modern authentication because they are reliable, secure, and hard to fake. Of course, they aren’t the perfect technology, but they come with several crucial benefits that security experts don’t find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some benefits of behavioral biometrics include:</p>
 
 Passive Technology: Behavioral biometrics are inherently passive, requiring system observation rather than directed input from the user. Rather than speaking into a microphone or handing over their <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/fingerprint-verification/">fingerprint verification</a> data, users simply do what they do–the more relaxed and normal, the better. 
 Continuous Authentication: Continuous authentication is a relatively new and complex practice, but one with several critical benefits. Rather than rely on a single point of authentication (or several points of authorization), a device can monitor the user and continuously determine whether the same user is present. 
 
<p>This avoids complicated authentication systems while providing liveness testing that prevents, for example, someone else from using a workstation or device without authorization.</p>
 
 Fraud Detection: Behavioral biometrics are critical to massive anti-fraud efforts. Machine learning can help observe shoppers online to see how they engage with a digital storefront, what kind of information they provide, and how they interact with sensitive areas of their accounts. 
 
<p>Furthermore, these anti-fraud efforts are critical for modern chargeback fraud prevention, where people buy items, report stolen cards, and have their bank reverse charges.</p>
 
 Works With Other Biometrics: Because these biometrics are primarily passive, they work rather well with other forms of biometrics. For example, a user may provide <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-iris-biometrics/">iris biometrics</a> to access a sensitive workstation equipped with monitoring tools covering typing behaviors to ensure that no one else takes over if the original, authorized individual walks away. 
 
 Things to Watch out for with Behavioral Biometrics 
<p>First, it is important to note that not all types of behavioral biometrics would be applicable to all use cases. Measuring and iterating on cost of deployment, accuracy and performance, false acceptance and false rejection rates will remain key items to monitor.<br>
Second, not all forms of behavioral biometrics are created equal in their abilities to prevent fraud. Voice biometrics, for example, is relatively easier to spoof and is subject to replay risks. Voice is also subject to enrollment risks when there is background noise to deal with, for example.</p>
 Utilize Biometrics and Advanced Identity Assurance with 1Kosmos 
<p>By using different forms of biometrics, organizations can close security gaps leveraged by hackers, including those associated with passwords or other forms of authentication.</p>
<p>But biometrics isn’t necessarily enough, and many solutions rely too heavily on single biometrics within an MFA approach to protect their data. 1Kosmos relies on advanced biometrics coupled with powerful passwordless protection, a permissionless blockchain identity management system, and NIST-compliant identity proofing and liveness testing capabilities.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can rely on the following features:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/sim-binding-definition/">SIM Binding: </a>The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-proofing/">Identity Proofing: </a>BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 
<p>Integration: 1Kosmos can ingest behavioral and peripheral risk signals. For example, we have partnered with organizations like Behaviosec and RSA to track user behavior (desktop, mobile and environmental factors). This capability will detect attacks, including session hijacking or credential loss on an access attempt. This combination of technologies improves your overall security posture as you can detect potentially fraudulent activities in real-time and step-up authentication if something out of the band is noted with the most negligible impact on the user.</p>

Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

About Podcast Episode 
<p>A Trust Registry is a solution that lets you know where to reach out to get answers to make your trust decisions.</p>
<p>In any interaction, do I trust things sufficiently enough to accomplish what I want?</p>
<p>For example, how can I:</p>
 
 Trust this Issuer for that Credential? 
 Trust that Verifier? 
 Trust that Wallet App? 
 
 
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Darrell are:</p>
 
 What are the differences between Verifiable Data Registries and Trust Registries?

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p><a href="http://indicio.tech/indicio-proven">Proven</a> is Indicio’s flagship product—a complete and fully open source system for creating, holding, exchanging, and authenticating digital information using decentralized, interoperable verifiable credential technology.</p>
<p>Indicio designed Proven to make it easy for organizations to integrate, use, and scale verifiable credentials to authenticate information and share it in privacy-preserving, secure ways. It does this by removing the learning curve to implementing open source decentralized identity codebases and providing all the components needed to quickly deploy a complete verifiable credential solution—a Trusted Digital Ecosystem.</p>
<p>Proven isn’t a platform. It’s an open source way to build open source, interoperable ecosystems or platforms. Indicio provides all the support and training needed to do this, and it will continue to provide updates to the software. But customers are free to build on Proven to meet their needs. You own it; Indicio doesn’t own you.</p>
<p>This approach provides the flexibility needed to drive adoption, accelerate digital transformation, and unlock innovation.</p>
<p>How? And why do you need this technology? <br>Our <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-white-paper/">new</a><a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-white-paper/"> white paper</a> explains how Proven addresses the chronic problems of fraud, verification, privacy, and security through open source, interoperable, decentralized identity technology.</p>
<p>It does this by giving organizations the ability to build what we call “Trusted Digital Ecosystems.” Information in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem is verifiable without having to check in with the original source of that information, create complex integrations,&nbsp; or rely on a third party to store and validate the information.</p>
<p>The upshot is that digital information in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem becomes immediately actionable by being immediately verifiable. This has many implications from KYC to providing identities for verifying machines and device data, and to implementing Zero-Trust security, and the white paper looks at how Indicio’s customers are using the technology behind Proven to solve a wide range of problems and build new products and services.</p>
<p>This is just the first wave of innovation. By “proving anything,” Proven is a way to free information and identity through making it verifiable and actionable. What does that world look like? Read on—and then go build it with Proven!</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Two signs point to the fact the United States is gearing up to finally take a tougher regulatory stance on data privacy.</p>



 Sign 1: Steady progress on a comprehensive privacy bill 



<p>A new bipartisan bill to rein in Big Tech and give consumers more control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;is making steady forward progress—certainly, the most progress we’ve seen of any similar bill to date.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/new-bipartisan-federal-data-privacy-bill-in-the-us-but-will-it-pass/">bill</a>,&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-heads-for-us-house-floor/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>,&nbsp;has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass. As the Institute of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-heads-for-us-house-floor/">reports</a>, “Despite facing a time crunch, a flood of stakeholder feedback and unforeseen Congressional opposition, the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act keeps on chugging.”</p>



<p>The bill has now advanced to consideration by the full House. The IAPP says the vote to advance the bill marks the first time a comprehensive privacy bill will go to a full chamber vote in either the House or the Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill represents a compromise on both sides, with Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., Chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, which proposed the bill, saying, “I know almost everyone can probably find something that they wished were different in the bill. On the other hand, I do think we have a band-aid for the American people who are just fed up with the lack of privacy online.”&nbsp;</p>



 Sign 2: The FTC is gearing up for a major ruling on data privacy 



<p>While many agree a federal data privacy law is the end goal and the best outcome, the FTC is meanwhile flagging its serious commitment to “commercial surveillance and data security rulemaking” by releasing a list of questions for lawmakers, privacy advocates, and ordinary citizens. Read the list of questions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/commercial-surveillance-data-security-rulemaking">here</a>.</p>



<p>Until now the FTC has ruled on data privacy case by case but, as the release of the questions shows, it’s preparing to address the issue more comprehensively in future and is seeking public input.</p>



<p>In releasing the rulemaking questions to tighten the US regulatory environment, FTC Chair Lina Khan&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/ftc-sets-the-wheels-in-motion-for-a-major-data-privacy-ruling/">explained</a>&nbsp;the threat of a lack of data privacy:&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“The data practices of today’s surveillance economy can create and exacerbate deep asymmetries of information — exacerbating, in turn, imbalances of power. And the expanding contexts in which users’ personal data is used — from health care and housing to employment and education — mean that what’s at stake with unlawful collection, use, retention, or disclosure is not just one’s subjective preference for privacy, but one’s access to opportunities in our economy and society, as well as core civil liberties and civil rights.”</p>



<p>FTC Commissioner Slaughter&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/ftc-sets-the-wheels-in-motion-for-a-major-data-privacy-ruling/">adds to the reasoning</a>&nbsp;for the rules: “The best time to initiate this lengthy process was years ago, but the second-best time is now. Effective nationwide rules governing the collection and use of data are long overdue. As the nation’s principal consumer-protection agency, we have a responsibility to act.”</p>



<p>We like how&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/ftc-sets-the-wheels-in-motion-for-a-major-data-privacy-ruling/">Tech Crunch</a>&nbsp;sums up the situation we’re now in: “The rules being mulled by the FTC may well end up being complementary or even superfluous to federal law, but that is only if by some miracle Congress can pass another major piece of legislation. But if this ends up being the case, consumers will simply be twice as safe.”</p>



<p>“What happens next is a lot of waiting and submitting of documents; the FTC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rulemaking/public-participation-rulemaking-process">put together a FAQ on the rulemaking process here</a>, and on September 8 the agency will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2022/09/commercial-surveillance-data-security-anpr-public-forum">host a virtual public forum</a>&nbsp;to discuss the proposal.”</p>



<p>We’ll keep following this story.</p>

<p>Looking to implement zero trust in your organization but don’t know where to start? Keep reading to find the best way to get a zero-trust model up and running.</p>
<p>What is zero trust? Zero trust is a security strategy that requires continual authentication through every step of access in that no user is given implicit trust.</p>
 What Is Zero-Trust Architecture? 
<p>Zero-trust architecture is an approach to security that presupposes that no user, resource, or application is considered inherently trusted by the system. In an age of seamless app integration and simplified user experiences through shared resources, zero trust attempts to close the security gaps introduced by such approaches.</p>
 Why Zero Trust is Important 
<p>This approach is critical when we consider that modern computing is essentially cloud computing–that is, most agencies, enterprises, and end users are engaging in some way with shared cloud-hosted computing resources. This has led to several notorious security issues over the past 5-10 years, and in industries where security is paramount (industrial industries, government services, etc.), those issues must be avoided.<br>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">Special Publication 800-207</a>, “Zero Trust Architecture,” to address this specific issue. This special publication lists seven core tenets of an accurate zero-trust system:</p>
 
 All data and services are resources. Any component of a digital system, from apps to data and network connections, is considered a resource that can be exploited, corrupted, or stolen. As such, they must all fall under the designation of a resource for security purposes. 
 All communication is secured. All network communications must be secured through perimeter security and encryption, whether external or internal to the organization. 
 Access is on a per-session basis. Access is only granted per resource, with the least privileges needed to complete a given task. 
 Access policies should be dynamic. Policies around user or app access should be determined by the evolving contexts of the system, including time and date, location, versions of applications, client or user identity, behavioral biometrics, and more. 
 Ongoing monitoring should measure the integrity of security. An organization must continually monitor resources to ensure they have not been compromised. No resource is inherently considered trustworthy to avoid threats from APTs and advanced attacks. 
 Authentication and authorization are strictly enforced. An enterprise must use ongoing <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> and authorization, Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to determine<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/zero-trust-identity/"> identity</a> and re-authenticate and reauthorize users based on ZTA policy. 
 Data gathering and improvements are ongoing projects. The organization must maintain continuous monitoring and data gathering to fuel ongoing improvements to security measures implemented. 
 
<p>With these core principles in mind, several models of zero trust are in use:</p>
 
 Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): The most common form of zero trust, ZTNA includes perimeter-based security, perimeter authentication and authorization, segmentation of network resources, and secure access from external networks. This does not, however, impact application use or other select areas of security. 
 Zero Trust Application Access (ZTAA): Using zero trust principles, ZTAA assumes that all apps and resources are inherently untrusted and blocks access to and from these resources until proper authentication is provided. 
 Zero Trust Access (ZTA): ZTA combines ZTNA and ZTAA to protect networks and application access points. This is generally considered “end-to-end” zero trust and is the most comprehensive, but can require a fundamental adjustment in how your organization thinks about its IT infrastructure. 
 
 How to Implement Zero-Trust Principles 
<p>One of the most challenging components of a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-security-framework/">zero-trust security framework</a> is its implementation. Such implementation requires that all appropriate systems and networks fall under such principles, a deep, complicated, and thorough standard to meet.</p>
<p>However, there are specific things that your team can do to start implementing such an architecture:</p>
 
 Understand All Attack Surfaces: While this might seem common sense in the world of compliance, it states that pursuing zero-trust architecture means understanding all the potential attack surfaces you maintain. Namely, all resources, network connections, APIs, applications, etc. 
 Implement Ongoing Logging and Monitoring: Ongoing monitoring and audit logging is necessary, not an option. Not only is this practice critical for ensuring that resources are trustworthy (a key and continuous process in zero-trust systems), but it also informs the equally necessary practice of maintaining secure, upgraded, and optimized infrastructure. 
 Implement Strong Encryption for Internal Communications: All communications, from apps to internal and external network communications, must be protected. This means shrinking perimeter guards closer to the resources they protect and encrypt any and all data that moves through protected networks. 
 Use Strict Multi-Factor Authentication and Access Management Controls: Authentication must be strong enough to ensure a user is who they are, which by default means MFA is equipped with something like advanced biometrics or secure delivery of OTPs. 
 
<p>This also means implementing strict least-privilege access controls based on a dynamic set of features, namely role, system and hardware state, software state, and user behavior.</p>
 
 Update All Devices and Applications: All devices must be safely and regularly updated to meet minimum security requirements. More specifically, this means ensuring that security patches are deployed and implemented as soon as possible. 
 Have Strict Governance Policies in Place: Zero trust is not an ad hoc process. Your organization must have clear, documented, and distributed data and IT governance policies that align with zero trust issues. This includes defining a hierarchy of roles, accountability, and responsibilities for all affected positions. 
 
 What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Zero Trust? 
<p>Like any other technology or security approach, zero trust comes with several challenges and benefits that impact how it is used. Each organization may run into unique challenges and benefits, but there are some broad considerations to consider.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of zero trust include:</p>
 
 Security: Approaching IT with zero trust principles is remarkably secure. They do not allow trusted access to resources and require incessant authorization before such access is granted. Likewise, it’s an approach to trust for internal resources that drives users always to ensure that their IT infrastructure isn’t compromised. 
 Compliance: With the release of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order on Cybersecurity</a>, government and infrastructural cybersecurity are quickly undergoing an overhaul of security guidelines–namely, that they all meet zero trust principles. If you’re working with these industries or adjacent industries, zero trust is a genuine concern that you’ll want to meet. 
 Trust: Approaching security via zero trust means that anyone accessing resources is who they say they are once you’ve laid out the proper security and monitoring procedures. 
 
<p>Likewise, there are several challenges to implementing zero-trust architectures:</p>
 
 Complexity: Zero trust is complicated and can touch on every interlocked system in your IT infrastructure. If you’re looking at full ZTA implementation, it could require a complete revision of how you approach IT adoption, organization, and security. 
 Cost: As you approach such a massive overhaul, costs in time and money grow. Once some of the components are in place, there is a leveling off, but the onboarding and maintenance cost is still significant. 
 Flexibility: Zero trust is strict and doesn’t broach any breaks in the trust cycle for scalability or usability. If you want a more streamlined app that doesn’t fit into ZTA, then you simply aren’t using that app and staying in line with its principles.

<p>What is fingerprint verification? Fingerprint verification uses a fingerprint scan to identify and verify that a user is who they say they are. Fingerprint authentication is the most popular way to use biometrics.</p>
 How Does Fingerprint Verification Work? 
<p>User authentication is a complex process, and similar terms are often used to refer to slightly different processes. Such is the case with finger scan identification.<br>
To start, fingerprints are considered a form of biometric ID. These are biometric authentication methods that use the physical traits of the user to authenticate them against user records in a given system, including traits like the following:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 Iris traits 
 Facial characteristics 
 Voice characteristics 
 
<p>In this case, using fingerprints provides a high level of security. While it is <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/myth-fingerprints-180971640/">technically possible for a pair of identical fingerprints to exist, it is highly, highly unlikely</a>, and less likely to appear in any configuration that would threaten security significantly.</p>
<p>In its most basic form, fingerprint verification involves a user providing two pieces of information: an ID and a fingerprint scan. The ID can be something like a username or PIN to notify the system that a specific user is attempting to access the system.</p>
<p>The data comes from a scanner that can read and map the unique aspects of a fingerprint, including the ridges, valleys, whorls, patterns, and other unique characteristics, and translate that into digital data. Then that information is used as a way to verify users.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that verification is different from fingerprint identification:</p>
 
 Fingerprint Identification is the process of taking a user’s fingerprint and comparing it against a database to determine its link with a user. For example, we’ve all seen police procedurals that include software that scans fingerprints to find a match in a police database. That’s identification. 
 Fingerprint Verification is the use of data along with a form of identification to determine that the user is who they claim to be. 
 
<p>The difference seems slight, but they change the application of the technology immensely. In the latter (verification), the user is actively attempting to access a system and, accordingly, provides some sort of credential to do so. The biometric scan is checked against a specific fingerprint associated with that identity, and if they don’t match, then access is denied. The fingerprint may exist in the system, but if the specific combination of ID and fingerprint are not provided, then there is no match.</p>
 Why Is Fingerprint Verification Important for Businesses? 
<p>Verification is an incredibly useful piece of technology for several reasons, all of which can streamline and simplify how you authenticate users inside your organization and outside of it (like clients or customers).</p>
<p>Verification is important because it provides the following benefits:</p>
 
 Strengthened Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): With a combination of passwords or PINs and scans, you can bolster your authentication security simply by way of introducing biometric MFA. Biometrics are notoriously hard to fake or steal, and even if they are, the hacker must still provide some sort of physical artifact to pass a scan. That’s on top of the fact that a hacker or algorithm isn’t going to guess biometric data through brute-force attacks. 
 Reduced IT Costs: While verification can cost money to implement in terms of software and hardware, it can, in the long run, help eliminate common IT problems like lost passwords. Using biometric authentication, you can automate password recovery or even implement passwordless authentication systems. 
 Mobile Employees, Customers, and Clients: Most modern mobile devices, including many laptops, smartphones, and tablets include some sort of biometric scanner, sometimes multiple scanners. MacBook Pros and the 2021 versions of iMac Pros include some form of facial or fingerprint scanning. Modern Windows computers often have both. Smartphones and tablets will almost always include a fingerprint or face scanner as well.With that in mind, having scanning as part of your authentication and verification system can open up secure ways for your team to work remotely. Likewise, it can provide the security you need to interact with customers on their mobile devices for things like accepting payments (PCI compliance) or supporting advanced security technologies. 
 
<p>There are some limitations to biometric verification:</p>
 
 Non-Transferability: A fingerprint is immutable. If your account is compromised or something needs changing, then it is a much larger task that could require new fingerprints from other fingers or some other physical verification method. 
 Expense: While verification is probably one of the more cost-effective biometric tools to include as part of your authentication system, it still costs more than your typical password system. This might be a major turn-off for smaller organizations looking to maintain lower costs (although this is less of a concern as technology becomes cheaper). 
 Not Touch-Free: As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, there is a great value in having touchless systems that don’t involve public exposure. While this is less a problem on personal phones, it becomes much more of a problem for public computers or laptops. 
 
<p>While there are some drawbacks to verification, more often than not, they are useful, cost-effective, and secure forms of MFA that can support your IT and compliance strategies.</p>

<p>How digital identity can improve the passenger journey.</p>



 The potential of digital identity wallets in the air travel industry. 



<p>Summer is over and so is the annual travel rush. Every summer, millions of people worldwide hit the airport in searching for sunny beaches and vacation fun. However, travelling during peak season can often be frustrating for passengers. The aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic is still present and impacts the passenger experience from curb to gate, as long lines, missed flights, and lost luggage remain too common. This brings the question; how can we make the travel experience a little less painful?</p>



 The potential of digital identity wallets in the air travel industry. 



<p>Now imagine a world where you can simply breeze through security checkpoints and skip the long and tiresome lines at the airport. Through digital identity wallets, this future is about to become a reality. Whether you are a frequent passenger travelling for business, or a tourist seeking leisure holiday, this revolutionizing technology can smoothen your travel journey and your passenger experience.</p>



 What is the concept of digital identity, and why is it important? 



<p>Until now, we relied on physical id document such as ID cards <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driving licenses to identify</a> ourselves in the real world as well as online. Digital attributes and credentials were solely used online. Digital identity wallets, like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, are about to change that, as they are simultaneously addressing our digital and real-world requirements by bringing physical and digital credentials together.</p>



<p>Digital identity wallets enable you to verify, store, and most importantly reuse verified identity information from your smartphone, in a convenient, secure and legally recognized way. Your sensitive personal information is securely stored and encrypted on your phone and can only be accessed by yourself. Keep control of your data by choosing which information you want to share, with whom and when.</p>



 eiDAS 2.0. and the European digital identity framework. 



<p>With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS 2.0</a>, the second version of the central European regulation for electronic Identification, authentication and trust Services, the European Commission has introduced a new European digital identity framework. The objective is to create an interoperable ecosystem of digital identity wallets and enable EU citizens to use their digital identity to access public and private services across the EU. eIDAS 2.0 and the underlying trust framework is the foundation for the legal recognition of digital identity wallets, such as the IDnow Wallet, in the EU and beyond.</p>



 What information can you store in your digital identity wallet? 



<p>Digital identity wallets allow you to store anything from your government issued ID card and driver’s license, over biometric information as well as additional attributes, such as a frequent flyer membership card.</p>



<p>After a document or other credential has been verified and stored, the wallet empowers you to reuse the verified identity and share only the necessary information with the relying parties. The IDnow Wallet allows you to reuse the personal data of your identity in multiple scenarios. Use your verified identity to rent a car today or for your hotel check-in tomorrow.</p>



 The potential of digital identity wallets in the air travel industry. 



<p>Think about your own travel journey and the number of times you have to identify yourself: from booking flights, dropping off luggage at the airport, passing security, a small stop at the duty-free store, boarding the plane, to finally sitting at your seat and enjoying some in-flight services, and the list goes on when you land at your destination. Therefore, the air travel industry in particular offers a great potential for leveraging digital identity wallets.</p>



<p>Air travel use cases for digital identity to improve the passenger experience.</p>



<p>As digital identity wallets become more prevalent, the air travel industry has the opportunity to leverage this technology to improve the passenger journey. Below, we outline use cases for digital ID within the travel experience.</p>







  Online Flight Booking<br>When booking a flight online, identify yourself in one click using your identity wallet to automatically fill out required forms and anticipate the joy of a laid-back holiday.<br>  Airport Check-In<br>Using your digital identity wallet will keep your check-in process short and sweet. Save yourself some time by avoiding coming hours prior to departure, or equally enjoy that time at your favorite airport lounge.<br>  Baggage Drop-Off<br>Experience a fast and contactless luggage drop off, as a simple biometric facial recognition can link your baggage receipt to the personal data on your ID and your boarding pass, all of which will be safely stored in your digital identity wallet.<br>  Security Checkpoints &amp; Border Gates<br>Skip the queue and avoid clogged border gates, as the digital identity wallets allows you to breeze through security checkpoints. No more rummaging through your luggage for your passport, just look into the camera to verify your identity and smile as you pass through.<br>  Boarding<br>Once checked in, your digital identity wallet stores your boarding pass as well as your ID credentials. After a simple biometric check, you can cross the gate and reach your seat in all serenity.<br>  In-Flight Services<br>Customize your in-cabin experience during long-haul flights, by indicating your entertainment and dietary preferences to start your holiday relaxation a little earlier than expected.  



 How digital ID can benefit businesses in the travel industry. 



<p>Consequently, there is no doubt that digital ID enhances the passenger’s journey by making it faster and more convenient. Furthermore, digital identity wallets represent a win-win situation for both passengers and carriers. In fact, they enable a higher efficiency though their seamless touchpoints, which not only increases customer satisfaction but also benefiting airlines and airports as less ground personnel are required to process travelers.</p>

<p>Munich, September 29, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>,&nbsp;a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces a global collaboration with Adobe Document Cloud, the world’s leading PDF and e-signature tools solution, to make identify verification for validated signatures simpler and more secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legally compliant signing with a qualified electronic signature (QES) requires users to identify themselves before signing a document. But even for an advanced electronic signature (AES), it can be beneficial to have upstream identification and authentication of the signing party. <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/09/28/adobe-acrobat-sign-raises-bar-trusted-digital-agreements-digital-identity-gateway">Adobe Acrobat Sign Digital Identity Gateway</a>&nbsp;allows organizations to select from a wide variety of&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/document-cloud/digital-identity/dig-csc-idps.html">pre-configured third-party digital identity providers (IDP)</a>&nbsp;and leverage the type of identity verification that best suits their functional, security, or compliance needs. IDP services for user authentication, signer identity verification, and identity federation solutions utilize the standard&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>&nbsp;authentication protocol to integrate with Acrobat Sign.&nbsp;IDnow is now an Adobe Acrobat Sign Digital Identity Gateway provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity&nbsp;verification&nbsp;via IDnow AutoIdent or VideoIdent for electronic signatures&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Digital Identity gateway, Acrobat Sign users automatically receive notification when a particular type of identity verification is required to access and sign the document. After the user consents, the identification process is passed on to the IdP service. Once the identity check has been successfully completed, the user can access the document and then sign it electronically with their verified identity in a secure and legally compliant manner.</p>



<p>The IDnow integration will enable Adobe Acrobat Sign users to verify their identity using either IDnow AutoIdent or VideoIdent to create legally binding e-signatures as soon as the solution launches. The new authentication capabilities will also be available to customers using Acrobat Sign through native integrations on platforms such as Workday, Salesforce, Microsoft, or Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to IDnow VideoIdent and AutoIdent, Adobe Acrobat Sign users can authenticate via the IDnow Wallet in the future. Users who already have a verified identity stored in their IDnow Wallet will thus be able to skip the identity verification process.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to support Adobe with their new Digital Identity Gateway and to be part of a solution that provides users with a secure and straightforward signature process. In the future, not only Adobe customers will benefit from the cooperation between the two companies&nbsp;–&nbsp;our customers will also be able to use their familiar IDnow solutions via the Acrobat Sign platform. In the future, we plan to intensify the cooperation and expand it in further use cases,” says Johannes Leser, Vice President Trust Services at IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Secure and user-friendly electronic signatures, and thus secure authentication and identity verification of the signing party, are becoming increasingly important in the digital world. This is true worldwide and for all industries. We are therefore pleased to have IDnow as a reliable partner for identity verification through our Digital Identity Gateway,” adds Andrea Valle, Product Management Lead Adobe Acrobat Sign.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">NB Orbit Enterprise Platform</a> contains a collection of technologies and concepts in identity management, distributed and edge computing, distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. These have all been put together following the principles of Privacy, Security and Interoperability.</p>
<p>One of the things that organizations can do through NB Orbit Enterprise Platform is to create schema definitions with attributes. These attributes can be restricted by the data formats they must comply with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until now, we were supporting multiple formats such as Text, Number and Date, as shown below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recently, we’ve added the support for Images as Attributes.</p>
 
 We will demonstrate how the platform allows an image as an attribute in the schema definition process.&nbsp; 
 We will demonstrate the issuance of a verifiable credential that includes an image as an attribute. 
 We will demonstrate how image attributes can be provided as proofs.&nbsp; 
 
 
  
 
<p><br>
How is this done through Aries? To pass images as attributes, we specify the MIME TYPE as JPEG and the value contains a base64url-encoded string that represents a binary BLOB of the image. <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md">RFC 0453</a> (Issue Credential v2), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">RFC&nbsp; 0037</a> (Present Proof) and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md">RFC 0454</a> (Present Proof v2) all support the mime-type and value as a base64url-encoded string.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 28 September, 2022 –&nbsp;Leading digital identity proofing platform provider, IDnow, has announced a UAE collaboration with UBIRCH,&nbsp;a leading German trust platform provider&nbsp;with regional headquarters in Dubai. For the launch of one of the world’s first KYCT (know-your-customer token) solutions, UBIRCH partners with IDnow. The solution proves the identity and ownership of crypto wallet holders and origin of minted assets, such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UAE has one of the highest rates of NFT ownership in the world, with 23 percent of the population owning at least one, which is around double the global average*. Many of the early crypto exchanges did not require a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check,</a>&nbsp;which has led to a lack of trust in NFTs and a gap between the creator (maker) of an NFT and the buyer. Combined with identity theft, challenges with proving ownership and origins of an asset in a legally binding contract and ensuring digital art can be protected are current market barriers that must be overcome. At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry is rapidly changing and so are the regulation requirements. Therefore, the leading companies in crypto trading worldwide now enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with AML and KYC regulations.</p>



<p>Karim Attia, CEO of UBIRCH said,&nbsp;“The UAE is one of the leading countries for adoption of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. To support the popularity and growth of digital assets, our partnership with IDnow will enable us to create the most secure and trusted process for verifying identity and proof of origin, yet. Ultimately, this technology is essential to protect individuals, businesses, brands, creators and the entire financial ecosystem in a decentralized environment.”</p>



<p>Benjamin Haas, Senior Director EMEA of IDnow group said, “Bringing an additional identity layer to digital assets adds trust and credibility to the entire Web3 including crypto exchanges, NFTs and other financial offerings. Secure verification proves the identity of the creator and provides authenticity to the ownership of NFTs. It helps to close the gap between the NFT creator and the buyer, while reassuring the buyer that what they are purchasing is genuine.”</p>



<p>The KYCT technology (<a href="https://www.kyct.xyz/">kyct.xyz</a>) addresses some of the challenges of the crypto and NFT community in ensuring that identity – both digital and legal – and proof of origin are accurate. The two companies join forces through UBIRCH’s trusted backend for proving that an asset belongs to a creator and was anchored at a specific time, and IDnow’s leading identity proofing platform that confirms the customer’s legal identity with the help of an official identification document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While NFTs have been popularized through digital art, the technology can also be applied across a range of sectors, such as the tokenization of digital health records, as digital access-passes and tickets for events, or any occurrence where a tokenized model can be applied to acting parties and digital assets.</p>



<p>UBIRCH was founded in Germany in 2014 and has since expanded its global presence to the UAE, with offices in Dubai and Tel Aviv, Israel. As cybersecurity expert, UBIRCH brings advanced technology that propels digital transformation. UBIRCH is driven by a team of professionals who believe data-driven processes will provide many cross-industry exciting businesses, such as in the manufacturing industry, smart cities, insurance, healthcare, energy supply or logistics segments. UBIRCH is renowned through the contract awarded by the German Ministry of Health to develop, together with a consortium, the digital COVID certificate for the EU for Germany, based on UBIRCH technology.</p>

 IDnow sits down with Brandi Reynolds, CAMS-Audit, CCI, CCCE at Bates Group to discuss what traditional banks can learn from crypto asset providers, and the unlikely role of blockchain technology. 



 What are some of the unique challenges that financial institutions must face in developing an effective compliance program for cryptocurrency?&nbsp; 



<p>Financial institutions must take steps to understand the unique AML and compliance risks associated with cryptocurrency, especially around transaction monitoring rulesets and the fragmented regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>



 Would you advise financial institutions tackle cryptocurrency separately, or attempt to bring crypto into the fold of an existing compliance program?&nbsp; 



<p>Crypto will require unique policies and procedures, especially around transaction monitoring, but it can be incorporated into an existing compliance program. However, this is contingent on the types of products and services being offered – for instance, a crypto product which includes both traditional (fiat) as well as digital assets may be able to draw on elements of an existing compliance program, but a product that is purely digital will likely require, at minimum, an expansion of policies and procedures to address its specific risks.&nbsp;</p>



 What is your opinion on the pace of the global development of regulations and compliance best practices, as they relate to cryptocurrency?&nbsp; 



<p>The pace of regulations and best practices is irregular and fragmented, since the development of regulations is proceeding at radically different pace across the globe, and even within individual countries (such as the varying levels of state-specific regulations in the US)&nbsp;</p>



 Is there a particular region, or country that you would consider further along in its journey toward offering a safe and compliant regulatory framework for cryptocurrency?&nbsp; 



<p>Singapore and Estonia represent the most developed and stable regulatory frameworks globally. Within the US, while the regime is strict, the New York BitLicense represents the most well-developed regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, to the point where other states such as California are using it as the basis for their own comprehensive regulations.&nbsp;</p>



 If a financial institution was deliberating as to whether to either accept, or launch a crypto trading platform, what would you say are three major advantages (rewards) and three challenges (risks) of doing so?&nbsp; 



<p>The three main advantages would be: large amount of available potential investor capital, expanding use cases and user base for crypto products and services, and the diversification of investments and revenue streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For disadvantages, I would say: increased regulatory scrutiny, highly volatile markets with a high risk of business failure, and increased exposure to AML and fraud risks.&nbsp;</p>



 How important is the role of technology, and in particular KYC onboarding platforms, in enabling crypto firms to offer a safe and secure crypto customer experience?&nbsp; 



<p>Technology is critical for operating a risk-based crypto compliance program. In particular, blockchain monitoring software, which allows firms to risk rank wallet addresses and analyze their transaction activity, is becoming de facto required by regulators. </p>



<blockquote><p>Blockchain monitoring should be incorporated into the KYC process and should be seen as essential as practices such as collecting and verifying a photo ID.&nbsp;</p>Brandi Reynolds, CAMS-Audit, CCI, CCCE at Bates Group</blockquote>



 Are there any things you think the traditional banking sector could learn from the crypto space regarding best compliance and anti-money laundering practices?&nbsp; 



<p>The use of the blockchain as a recordkeeping system is revolutionary from a compliance standpoint, in that it allows a firm to instantly trace the movement of cryptocurrency through every wallet address it has ever interacted with. This makes identifying exposure to sanctioned, criminal, or high-risk entities much easier than in the traditional financial system, where a similar investigation could take months if not years. Thus, while crypto may have a higher inherent risk of being exploited by bad actors, this is offset by the ability to more easily identify suspicious activity on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



 With so many different rules and regulations pertaining to cryptocurrency across the world, how can financial institutions ensure they continue to operate compliantly and adhere to KYC best practices?&nbsp; 



<p>Financial institutions should carefully consider the types of crypto products they would like to offer and assess their inherent risk, including their customer bases’. This should include an assessment of the jurisdictions where the products would be offered and associated regulatory risks and requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 How would you assess the MiCA regulatory framework? Does it go far enough? Are there any glaring loopholes, or omissions?&nbsp; 



<p>It’s still too early in the development process to assess its impact. </p>



<blockquote><p>While MiCA will apply to all member states of the EU, there is no requirement that it be implemented at the level of national law, which presents potential restrictions on the passporting of licensing through the EU.</p>Brandi Reynolds, CAMS-Audit, CCI, CCCE at Bates Group</blockquote>



<p>It may also present additional regulatory burdens on firms due to its emphasis on consumer protection. However, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a> will present a unified framework which will greatly simplify other aspects of regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 As the UK is no longer part of the EU, and therefore subject to its AML and crypto regulatory requirements [especially MiCA], would you say this puts UK crypto shops, and UK crypto consumers at an advantage or disadvantage? &nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>There is a disadvantage in that UK crypto firms must pursue two tracks of regulatory registration and approval, one in the UK and one in an EU country. This increases the regulatory burdens on firms as they must comply with two distinct sets of regulations and increases the possibility of conflict between regulations, especially given that the UK is currently considering regulatory changes.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>California’s crypto bill, officially known as Assembly Bill 2269, aimed at enforcing crypto licensing and regulatory framework in the state, was vetoed by Gov.&nbsp;Newsom.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposed bill faced no objection from the opposition in the assembly.</blockquote><blockquote>Gov. Newsom believes that the bill is too rigid and is unlikely to safeguard consumers due to the fast-moving nature of the crypto industry.</blockquote><p>In a major setback to the crypto industry, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AB-2269-VETO.pdf?emrc=bb881d">California Governor vetoed</a> Assembly Bill 2269, popularly referred to as the crypto bill in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>The bill’s intended purpose was to grant operational licenses to crypto firms currently operating in California and make it mandatory for any company planning to offer crypto products &amp; services in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>Surprisingly, the bill moved to the Governor for approval after facing no opposition in the assembly. That said, Gov. Newsom does have his reasons behind his decision to veto the&nbsp;bill.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/sec-head-honcho-gary-gensler-double-downs-on-demand-for-strong-crypto-regulations-and-investor-6f8d538e2986">SEC Head Honcho Gary Gensler Double Downs on Demand for Strong Crypto Regulations and Investor Protection</a></p> The Reason Behind the&nbsp;Veto <p>Governor Newsom believes that the proposed bill fails to incorporate the fast-moving nature of the crypto ecosystem and its underlying technology. Instead, the bill adopts a rigid licensing and regulatory framework, which fails to take consumer safety into&nbsp;account.</p><blockquote>He notes, “It is premature to lock a licensing structure in statute without considering both this work (in-house efforts to create a transparent regulatory environment) and forthcoming federal actions.”</blockquote><p>Another reason Gov. Newsom gives is the costly nature of greenlighting such a bill, highlighting that this may cost a whopping “Tens of Millions of Dollars” in the first few years. As such, the expense must be accounted for in the annual&nbsp;budget.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-white-house-launches-a-comprehensive-framework-for-crypto-assets-2e451c57af5b">The White House Launches a Comprehensive Framework for Crypto&nbsp;Assets</a></p> Is Governor Newsom Anti-crypto? <p>Despite vetoing the bill, Gov. Newsom is not against the crypto industry. In fact, he <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AB-2269-VETO.pdf?emrc=bb881d">concluded his statement</a>, noting, “I am committed to working collaboratively with the Legislature to achieve the appropriate regulatory clarity once federal regulations come into sharper focus for digital financial assets while ensuring California remains a competitive place for companies to invest and innovate.”</p><p>If we turn the clock backward, we will see many positive comments from Gov. Newsom on cryptocurrencies. For instance, he <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/468870493211492352">had tweeted</a> in favor of making Bitcoin a regular thing in political donations.</p><blockquote>California, under Gov. Newsom, also became the <a href="https://twitter.com/govpressoffice/status/1521914722244648960">first state in the US</a> to work on a comprehensive framework to stay at the forefront of Web3 tech &amp; innovation. Such instances show that Gov. Newsom believes in the potential of digital assets and wants California to be a leader in virtual asset technology and innovation.</blockquote><p>Hence, once the federal government comes out with concrete plans on crypto regulations with a clearer stance on the legality of digital assets, Gov. Newsom will take a decisive step on the state’s crypto bill. At the same time, the bill will have to meet Gov. Newsom’s expectations by incorporating the changes &amp; sync with the fast-moving nature of the crypto assets and their underlying technology. So, all eyes will be on the federal government’s next move when it comes to crypto regulations, as it will influence Gov. Newsom’s decision to give the go-ahead to the state’s crypto&nbsp;bill.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

Come and meet us to find out how Ubisecure can help with your business challenges in cyber security and CIAM. To find out more, take a look at the Ubisecure events page, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/events/" title="<em>www.ubisecure.com/events</em>">www.ubisecure.com/events</a>. See you in Brussels.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. I was thinking, personally, I have been using for accessing many online services, I use many authentication methods, identification services that we have been discussing in this podcast, three years. But one that I have not used is a smart cards. For instance, even though hereby being a citizen of Finland, I have one, but I have not used it before. So that’s one of the things we’re going to discuss today, how to use a smart card for identification. And also, what are the other identification services in Europe and especially from Sweden that is from where our guest today is coming.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Roberth Lundin. He is a Senior Security Consultant at Knowit. For the last years, he has been working with Bankgirot as an IT Security Specialist in which one of his most important duties is to coordinate all security audits using risk-based approach. He also works with SOC SCM systems, Identity Governance and Administration, IGA among all the roles in his vast experience he has seen and contributed to the evolution of eIDs in Sweden, including smart cards.</p>
<p>Hello, Roberth.</p>
<p>Roberth Lundin: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, Roberth. So, let’s talk about data identity. But first of course, we want to hear a bit more about yourself. So please, you can tell us, yeah, your journey to this world of the that identity.</p>
<p>Roberth: I started in 1989 at a company named Bull. The first project I got was to finish a secure login and file transfer tool for UNIX, which use smart cards, high security smart cards, actually. Then I have been working for the next 20 years at Bull, Integris, Steria with personalisation systems for smart cards, issue system for electronic IDs and so on.</p>
<p>2009, I started work at Cybercom, which is now named Knowit. 2014, I started the first signing service using DIGGs framework, which I still work with part-time and been working for since 2015 to 2018 with electronic medical certificate and signing of them as a security specialist. And then for 2019, I worked at Bankgirot to secure their operations. That’s my background basically, very shortly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. We’re going to talk about smart cards and also the eIDs in Sweden and Europe. But first, I know something interesting is to think of in a broader aspect all the authentication methods and ways of verifying identities. So how can we trust one digital identity among all of the available ones?</p>
<p>Roberth: That’s a very good question. The Europe, basically, the authorities in Europe and everybody else is divided it into four levels. First level, it’s basically Facebook or something like, it’s an ID and password, and you have no control of your background, you basically check your email. Level two, you need to supply some kind of official registry, for example, in Sweden is the Tax Department’s register for example.</p>
<p>Level three is the level which the authority use in Sweden. And here you have one – added one feature. That’s when you get them digitally, you need to have a check with a physical ID card that you are the correct person in some way. And level four, which is basically only smart cards. This is the high security. And there you have also you need both at applying and picking up your electronic identity, you need to do physical ID check. For example, in Sweden, the Tax Department’s smart card you can buy. It’s both an ID card and an electronic ID card.</p>
<p>So basically, you need to put your digital identities in these four categories and base your trust on that. So, if you want to really secure, you will take level three and level four. So, Facebook, can you trust it? No, mm-mm. No. You have to be very careful because somebody can spoof the system very easily.</p>
<p>Oscar: Interesting to see that smart cards is at the top. Of course, you said at the top, the level three and four are the ones that are mostly recommended to be used. And I was thinking why smart card sit at the very top. It might be because of how the identity is stored. What can you say about that, so when trusting a digital identity secure in that storage?</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, that’s the difficult part because I have been working with, I mean, for 33 years now, basically how to store your keys, which you use for your electronic identity. Because machines, for example, where do we store the key which use the certificate, for example, is a web service certificate, it’s usually in the file system. It’s not very safely stored. And then you need to protect the whole system very, very hard. And that can be very tricky if you’re not very good at it.</p>
<p>But if you take a smart card, for example, well, you can’t copy a smart card. That’s very important. A phone, for example, you can make a copy of it, of a mobile phone. Most of them you can actually also break into if you’re very, very skilled, and have a lot of resources. And to smart card, you can’t, because its costs are enormous. It’s theoretically possible. Nobody has done it but if you have a very, very, very specialised equipment, which costs a lot of money, and there is not that many of them in the world, it’s theoretically, you can break one smart card. Is it cost effective? No, it’s not.</p>
<p>Basically, smartcards is the safest way can do it. Phones, it’s ­– as long as you have control over your phone, or don’t install a lot of apps on it, it should be OK. But same for a computer. And that means you need to don’t click on links, and so on. Make sure you have your antivirus and so on. You have a reasonably safe, so you can protect your keys, which is important for your electronic identities.</p>
<p>Take for example, I have the bank ID both mobile and card for Handelsbanken, which one is most safe of these two? Of course, the card. And certain operations in Handelsbanken, you can only do it by card and not by mobile phone. Interesting fact.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I was not aware of that, actually. Yeah. Somehow it surprises me because smart cards are not on our – many people’s minds. So yeah, as you said, it’s the most secure of all of them. So, what makes it more secure than a mobile phone or any other device?</p>
<p>Roberth: It’s because it’s one chip. What they have done is from the beginning, they put everything on one chip. So, in the chip, you have CPU, ROM, RAM, you have a communication channel, and you have security systems on it. That means if you want to break into it, you need basically, you need to go inside the chip. And that’s very difficult. Your smart card you have in your pocket, in your wallet, normally. These two facts is why it’s safe.</p>
<p>If you take your mobile phone, it’s stored in a special area in operating system on the phone. That’s not as safe because it’s possible break into these areas in the phone, by having the right privileges in the system. And another fact is that take for example, a smart card. The smart card takes – I talked with a guy who did the software for the electronic identity application on the smart card, and they spent 18 man-years just in validating it’s safe, 18 man-years, certify that this software is safe. You don’t do that with a phone software, because the same software is used for national identity cards. And they must be safe because the state is issuing them, they want them to be safe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, quite impressing indeed. Yeah, focusing first of all in Sweden, what are the other identification services available in Sweden right now?</p>
<p>Roberth: It’s a difficult question to answer because every authority needs to procure an identification services from suppliers like Knowit, CGI and so on, which they use as – to help them to log on to their web pages. So, all authorities, all the local municipalities, for examples have these a log on services. So, for example, I used Ellevio, EON and Fastum for examples to pay my bills and was using the same identification services together with mobile bank ID.</p>
<p>So, you don’t you don’t see these services because you go to the web page and say, “I want to use my mobile bank ID,” for example. And here, you have to have a services which is invisible, basically, which helps you log on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. But if we will narrow down to the methods, these are like bank ID, smart cards, so what on others are available in Sweden?</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah. I mean, if you think for as a private persons, you have the biggest is mobile bank ID, Freja eID Plus is contender, you had the Telia for a number of years, which is not very large. If you look at the health care for example, you have the SITHS&nbsp;card, which has 700,000 or 800,000 users, the same the authorities has their own card which you can use to log on to the PC, for example. So, there are a lot of this going on.</p>
<p>Oscar: What most of the users, I mean for the majority of people, what are the main eID for the people should be using?</p>
<p>Roberth: If you’re looking at look at it from my perspective, mobile bank ID has – its dominating, totally. I mean, it has 90 something basically, that everybody else is so small in comparison, I hope the Freja can be a contender. But they need to step up basically. In Sweden, everybody’s using mobile bank ID. And if they don’t using it, well, they will not get as good services from authorities or private companies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so its methods are requirements for many services, right, to government, and also from some private services.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us now more about smart cards. So how it started and why they are smart cards? I mean they are not only for identity, correct?</p>
<p>Roberth: I started to work with smart cards in 1989. And the first smart cards which were made was made in 1982. And they basically function the same way. Yes, it have upgraded the storage on it, instead of EEPROM, which you can only write once. You have EEROM, you can rewrite at certain memory cells. And you have standardised the cards very, very hard.</p>
<p>So, the standard ISO, standard 7816, 7816, it’s very, very good standard. I mean, it’s a very old standard, basically. And every national ID card you see is using it for example, SITHS&nbsp;card for the health care is using it and the bank ID on card is using it. It’s the same specification in the chip and how it’s handled. So, I have been using for 33 years already.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, quite long. And yeah, you said that the first of these smart cards started in 1982. Yeah, it’s like 40 years already. Yeah.&nbsp; It doesn’t feel, I don’t know, in Finland it’s not very popular. I don’t know if it’s more successful in other countries.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, that has been a problem, because that’s why everybody’s still mobile bank ID type of applications because everybody has a phone. But smart cards you need a card reader. And a couple of years ago, a lot of the PCs had card readers implemented, but nowadays, started removing them, which I think is bad. Because smartcards is a European thing. And the manufacturers is not European basically.</p>
<p>But in Europe, definitely, smart card is here now, it’s going to be something for the future. Because if you look at it, if you want the highest security, you’re going to use a smart card. So certain EU services, you need to have a smart card already today. Or else you can’t use the services.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So, you said that the laptops most recent they are stopping shipping laptops with a with a reader, integrated reader.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, because it has been a trend to remove all the ports on these – in mobile PC.</p>
<p>Oscar: Not only the smart card, yes.</p>
<p>Roberth: No, it’s everything, basically. So, you can be lucky if you have one or two USB ports.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. It’s very rare. Now it’s typically it’s one I think in many laptops today.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, and that’s a problem because then you need an accessory instead. I think is very bad idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but they’re still I mean, if you – you can still today find a laptop that comes with a smart card reader.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, you can do that. Because in Sweden and the rest of Europe, a lot of authorities require it. They don’t buy them else. So, they need some models will have them.</p>
<p>Oscar: I think it’s super clear now that you mentioned the security aspect is what makes a smart card good reason to stay and to take it seriously. Anything else related to smart cards that you can tell us?</p>
<p>Roberth: As I say, in Europe, because you want to have a safe identification methods. I know the Germans for example, say liked the idea of using a smart card to sign the documents you are sending to the authorities, because a smart card with level four trust level, it’s very, very, very hard to fake it. And you have documents – you can see who signed it, you can’t deny it that you signed it, because you’ll have – at the same time where you get to smart card, you have the duty to report it if you lose it. If you have not lose it, you haven’t, then you can’t deny it, it was you who did it.</p>
<p>Then it’s going – I mean you still have a person which stands there – I don’t know the English word for it Målvakt&nbsp;(Goalkeeper) in Swedish. It’s basically, nobody, which takes all the blame. You need to show that you own the company. And then you can’t put somebody dummy in between yourself. It’s very difficult when you have – must personally sign the documents, or else you get the traceability which is very, very difficult to break.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. In that perspective actually, if you just think of your own ID even if it’s not a smart card, so an ID is something that you would not leave it behind, right? You know where it is. And as you said, if you lose that one, you would report it, get a new one. So, with a bigger reason smart card.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, I mean, take for example, if you lose your electronic identities, you’re really, really handicapped in today’s society. So, it’s very important that you protect your electronic identities. Because if you lose them, you’re in a mess.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you get – what kind of called excluded or disconnected or, yeah, from many services. That’s correct. Tell us what is now the scenario, the landscape of the digital identities in Europe being broadly, so what’s going on today in Europe regarding this?</p>
<p>Roberth: It’s a very mixed bag to start with. But you can say one thing, every country in Europe has some kind of national identities in some way, everyone, because you can’t live without them, you need to have them. The development pace of different countries is very different. Some is very advanced, some are not.</p>
<p>The difficult part here is not actually digital identity. I started – I worked for the Belgium authorities with the BelPIC, which is the Belgium national ID card. This was in – around 20 years ago. It was not the problem to issue the cards because at that time, they had issued 5 or 6 million cards. It’s to have services that used them. And most countries in Europe has problem.</p>
<p>Sweden is a country which has a very, very good number of applications use national ID or similar schemes. Take for example, I spent 10 years to standardise a citizen card in Europe, at the European National Institute for Standards, CEN. It’s actually the standard we use for national ID cards today, the technical standard, because we failed in one aspect, and that was get one card for all countries in Europe because every state wants to control their own identities. We’ve never managed to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>The technical standard is pretty decent, I think, because every national ID, if you take the Swedish national ID Card from the police, it looks the same as other countries in Europe. But one card for every country in Europe? No, is not going to happen. If not EU managed to get major – a decision on all countries to follow the same card which is not going to happen. Too many countries, too many wills. Take for example the Polish, they absolutely refuse to leave control over their own identities from Poland to somebody else in Europe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds difficult as you said, 20 something countries here, it’s difficult to get that consensus.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, it’s not there. It’s the pain of not having – I mean, today, we’re talking about being able to use it. And pain for having different systems is not big enough, basically. There must be a problem first.</p>
<p>Oscar: And which other – besides the smart cards, what do you think would be a good solution for Europe?</p>
<p>Roberth: Basically, what the eIDAS regulation from EU actually requires Swedish authorities, for example, to have a page where you have a foreign card, I mean a card from Belgium or Estonia or other countries, which can log on to the Swedish page. So the Swedish authorities are required to have this page, which you can log on with the other country’s identities, but they’re not required to have any services behind at the moment, probably come in the next level of eIDAS regulation.</p>
<p>So, EU is starting to move in the direction of safe electronic identities for all countries. Take, for example, Sweden has been, well, sitting here and doing integration with all authorities and so on – getting service, but we have not looked what the rest of Europe is doing. So, Belgium and Estonia, especially has, well, has services which don’t have in Sweden. And we have a giant problem in Sweden, because in rest of Europe, they talk about qualified certificates. That means the issuer has a legal right if you have malfunction electronic ID or something like the issuing party doesn’t fulfil their expectations, there is a legal requirement for them to pay the third party.</p>
<p>For example, you and I make a transaction, and a third party, for example, my mother and because this transaction was faulty, because of the electronic identities used, and my mother is suffering from it, she has the legal rights to have compensation. This is the basic of qualified certificates. Plus, you have qualified – the standards for it is higher than the current in Sweden. And Sweden has not taken on the qualifying certificates, which the rest of Europe is a basic level, basically. So, we have in Sweden a challenge, we could say.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, in terms of signatures. And which countries you feel that are leading the development of these eIDs in Europe?</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, I mean, both Belgium and Estonia has, for example, electronic identities on smart cards for population. And Sweden, well, we have a mobile bank ID but it’s banks. The national ID card we have, yeah, it’s an ID card, but you don’t have any certificates on it. So, you can’t use it on an electronic ID. I don’t know what police is doing, but – or the government.</p>
<p>But then you have to use this Tax Department’s card, which is approximately the same as a national ID except you don’t get the guarantee that which country you come from which you get from the national ID card. Basically, or else they are the same card, basically, because early versions of the national ID card have the chip. So, it’s very easy to put the chip on it. But for some reason police doesn’t want to do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, interesting to know those details. Of course, as you said, every country is making progress by different speeds, different – yeah, making different decisions, of course. Yeah, thank you for shedding light on the eIDs across Europe. So, I would like to ask you one final question, Roberth. For all business leaders, listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Roberth: They need a strategy for electronic ID. And they need to stop using ID and passwords. You need to have some kind of handling on how you will use your electronic: that means how you identify the users, how you provision the electronic IDs, and what trust level you need to have on your electronic IDs.</p>
<p>Take for example very, very many companies in Sweden use AD from Microsoft, Active Directory from Microsoft. What they require is MFA or two-factors application basically, they need some kind of extra, you can get that for example as well. So, they’re moving in the right direction, but they haven’t really started to ask themselves basic handling of the electronic ID. And they definitely need this strategy because all these internet activities, cyber warfare and all these internet trolls, but especially the state-sponsored hacking groups, it’s not going to get better, it’s going to get worse. So, the ones who don’t have a strategy and know what they’re doing is going to be harshly punished. That’s my message, basically.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, again, Roberth. Super interesting conversation and giving a lot of details on the smart cards that we haven’t discussed before in this podcast, super secure, super interesting and sounds that it’s going to be with us for a long time still securing our identifications.</p>
<p>Roberth, please, if some people would like to follow you or get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Roberth: You can use my email address for now it’s Roberth.Lundin@Knowit.se. It’s probably the best way of getting in touch with me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot again, Roberth, and all the best.</p>

<p>Digital transformation in all aspects of life and work means that more resources are becoming accessible online. The online availability of public and enterprise services provides numerous benefits to organizations and consumers. However, it also means these resources are subject to innumerable <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/cybersecurity-fundamentals/threats.html">cybersecurity threats</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Password authentication systems have been the most prevalent means of protecting private information online, having been used for years to secure online digital assets. However, it’s become quite clear that passwords are insecure, and this method is no longer effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Verizon 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report, 80% of breaches involve <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/what-is-brute-force-attack.html">brute force attacks</a> or the use of lost or stolen credentials. Passwords—especially those used to secure access to privileged work accounts and network resources—are threat actors’ most sought-after target.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in data breaches and problems with password-only authentication systems have encouraged the IT industry to think about strengthening this authentication method or removing it entirely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article will discuss the disadvantages of password-only authentication systems, common attack techniques used to compromise passwords, and the most secure alternative solutions to replace password systems.</p>

<p>Here at Ping Identity, we recently polled fraud professionals across ecommerce and financial services businesses and discovered that the majority of the polled organizations are using between 4-8 fraud detection solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, while they were a minority in the poll, some even mentioned using ten or more sources of fraud and risk signals in their drive to improve fraud prevention. It is likely that due to the additive nature of fraud prevention, these numbers will continue to go up.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p>Legacy IAM systems can no longer meet the requirements of Digital Transformation. They often have a negative impact on business efficiency and customer experience. Such systems are too costly to maintain and are getting closer to reaching end-of-life. Today, organizations can be expected to manage billions of digital identities with their IAM systems. Organizations possessing legacy IAM systems must modernize their IAM systems and upgrade their capabilities. It is a transition that requires a comprehensive approach. Organizations must not only adapt to today's standards, but also become future-proof while complying with regulations. In this paper, we will consider what are the necessities for modernizing legacy IAM systems and how Curity aligns with them.

  Our anonymous credentials protocol update integrates Circom to enable developers to specify zero-knowledge "predicates" on credential attributes.

<p>TL;DR</p>  Use <a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom</a> to specify zero-knowledge "predicates" on credential attributes.  Circom is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) used to express computations for which zk-SNARKs need to be created.  Predicates are written as programs in the Circom language.  The programs are compiled with the Circom compiler and the artifacts are used to create zk-SNARKs.  The proof protocol is <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16</a>, an adaptation of Groth16 (used by ZCash).  <p>We have updated our anonymous credentials protocol that enables developers to express "predicates" (checks that return true or false) on credential attributes using the <a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom</a> language and then prove that these predicates are satisfied in zero-knowledge. This means that credential verifiers can check that certain credential attributes satisfy the required conditions without learning those attributes such as convincing a credential verifier that the holder is (or is not) a resident of certain cities without revealing the city or that the blood group is not AB- without revealing the blood group. In both these examples, the city and blood group were attributes of a credential and the holder convinced some facts about those without revealing them. More examples would be a holder proving that his yearly income is less than $25,000 for availing of social care where their yearly income is calculated from the pay slip of each month (adding each month's income and checking that the sum is less than desired). Similarly, the holder could prove that his yearly income is more than a certain amount to get access to a high-risk, high-reward investment fund.</p> Code and Examples <p>For folks wishing to jump right into the code, the support for Circom in LegoGroth16 is <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16/tree/comm-wit/src/circom">here</a>. It has been integrated into the composite proof system <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">here</a>. The Typescript support is added <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/">here</a>. The Circom circuits (.circom) and artifacts (.r1cs, .wasm) are <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16/tree/comm-wit/test-vectors">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/tree/master/tests/circom">here</a>. The .r1cs and .wasm files are generated for BLS12-381 curve and wasm optimizer (wasm-opt -O3) has been run over the .wasm files. Also, we only support Circom 2.</p><p>Here are some examples that demonstrate the use of Circom along with credentials:</p><p>1. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/yearly-income.spec.ts">The yearly income calculated from monthly payslips is less/greater than a certain amount</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/assets-liabilities.spec.ts">2. The sum of assets is greater than the sum of liabilities where assets and liabilities are calculated from several credentials</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/blood-group.spec.ts">The blood group is not AB-</a></p><p>4. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/grade.ts">The grade is either A+, A, B+, B, or C but nothing else</a></p><p>5. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/vaccination.spec.ts">Either vaccinated less than 30 days ago OR last checked negative less than 2 days ago</a></p><p>6. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/mimc-hash.spec.ts">Certain attribute is the preimage of an MiMC hash</a></p> Motivation <p>Previously, the expressivity of our anonymous credential proving system was limited. The holder could prove things like I have a credential(s), or certain attribute(s) across my credentials are the same or I can verifiably encrypt attribute(s) for traceability. But verifiers could not request proofs for more complicated conditions like the sum of certain attributes should be less/more than a certain value or an average of certain values is less/more than a certain value. These simple arithmetic operations might not always be sufficient and the holder might want to prove the preimage of a hash is the credential attribute, say to be used in the Merkle tree. Moreover, as library developers, we cannot imagine all the possible logic an application can require. One solution to this problem is to use a more powerful tool to express such conditions and that tool is a programming language. We wanted a developer-friendly programming language that could also be used with our proving system. We found Circom, developed by the folks at <a href="https://github.com/iden3">iden3</a>, to be the most popular such language with sufficient documentation and community around it.</p> Developer Workflow <p>1. Express the predicates/arbitrary computation as a Circom program.</p><p>2. Compile the above program to get the constraints (R1CS file) and witness generator (WASM file, takes input wires and calculates all the intermediate wires).</p><p>3. Use the constraints from step 2 to generate a zk-SNARK proving and verification key of LegoGroth16.</p><p>4. Use the R1CS and WASM files from step 2 and the proving key from step 3 to create a LegoGroth16 proof.</p><p>5. Use the verification key from step 3 to verify the LegoGroth16 proof.</p><p>Steps 1-3 are done by the verifier and the result of these steps, i.e. R1CS file, WASM file, proving, and verification key are shared with any potential prover (published or shared P2P). Step 4 is done by the prover and step 5 again by the verifier.</p> Cryptographic Details <p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">previous post</a>, we use <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16 protocol</a> for creating ZK-SNARKs. LegoGroth16 is similar to Groth16 (used by ZCash), but in addition to the zero-knowledge proof, it provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">cryptographic commitment</a> (Pedersen) to the private data (credential attributes in our case). This commitment allows us to prove that the private inputs to the proof protocol are the same as the credentials attributes using the Schnorr proof of knowledge protocol. </p><p>At a high level, the approach is to use BBS+ signatures to prove possession of a credential (knowledge of signature) and Circom to express arbitrary logic and use LegoGroth16 to get the proof of the correctness of the Circom program and use the Pedersen commitment to the witnesses in another zk-proof where I prove that the specific attributes signed under BBS+ are equal to the witnesses in the LegoGroth16 proof.</p><p>The Circom tooling however generates a Groth16 proof whereas we needed a LegoGroth16 proof. Fortunately, the Circom compiler outputs the R1CS (description of the computation) file containing the constraints and the WASM file to generate all the values in the circuit given the inputs. We use the R1CS file to do the SNARK setup, i.e. proving and verification key. This is a trusted setup and is done by the verifier. The prover uses the R1CS and WASM files and the proving key to then generate the zk-SNARK proof using our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">composite proof system</a>. Here, the prover can specify which of the Circom program inputs correspond to which of his credential attributes.</p><p>We acknowledge that the verifier can create fake proofs (proof of untrue statements) as he does the trusted setup but in most cases, the verifier has no incentive to cheat itself. When this is a possibility, like in a large public system deployed by a government, care must be taken to destroy the toxic waste (trapdoor) from the trusted setup. Also, because the proofs for the Circom program are created using the trusted setup done by the verifier, these proofs are designated verifier proofs unlike the proofs with BBS+ which are publicly verifiable.</p><p>Finally, we would like developers to try this new feature to build more expressive applications which are private as well. We would love to hear what all use-cases does this tool enable for you. If you need any support writing a Circom program for your use case, please reach out to us through Github.<br></p><p><br></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Just over a month ago, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/multi-cloud-weve-been-waiting-for">partnership between Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure</a> that has finally enabled their customers to create “properly multi-cloud” applications without any hidden costs or limitations of earlier architectures. Well, unfortunately, announcements like that aren’t heard often, simply because the very idea of such partnerships goes against cloud service providers’ traditional business interests. This obviously has worked remarkably well for Oracle and Microsoft, but at least to a certain extent because there is no rivalry between them in these areas, where they are traditionally strong. Connecting a business application running on Azure to a database backend on OCI is a win-win situation for both companies, and their customers can reap the benefits of that, too.</p>
 What if multi-cloud is not an option? 
<p>Unfortunately, this approach won’t necessarily be as successful with other potential partners. Take AWS, for example. The company offers a massive range of database services: over 15 purpose-built database engines for different data models and business use cases. Some of them compete directly with Oracle’s core products like the Oracle Database and MySQL. The rivalry between the companies has a long and quite bitter history. I can only imagine that establishing a mutually beneficial partnership here might take a few more years…</p>
<p>However, what are the ordinary customers supposed to do? In my last blog post I casually mentioned that “you can run SAP on AWS or Oracle on Azure,” as if it was somehow an inferior alternative to the real multi-cloud. Yes, it is usually not a fully managed service and is more difficult to set up, maintain, and operate than a native cloud service from the appropriate vendor. However, when no other options are available, this still can be a very sensible solution for many potential use cases. Provided, of course, that the vendor hasn’t cut any corners when migrating their service to the competitor’s cloud and there is some kind of feature parity guarantee between different deployment options.</p>
<p>Some vendors might go even further and design their products in an entirely cloud-agnostic way – those can be deployed to any cloud, and their customers can just choose where their tenant will be spun up. This approach has obvious advantages, but also one big downside: by design, it is created for the lowest common denominator across all supported clouds, not optimized for any particular cloud, and with no support for native services each CSP offers – such as identity, observability, or security, for example. This might work for some scenarios (Kubernetes is an example of a great success) but will fall short in others. I firmly believe that databases belong to the latter – ensuring the highest degree of performance, data protection, and regulatory compliance is not possible without strong optimization and native service integrations for a specific cloud provider.</p>
 What is MySQL HeatWave? 
<p>MySQL HeatWave is a managed database service created by Oracle that extends the standard MySQL engine with support for in-database high-performance transactional workloads, analytics, machine learning, and automation. Simply put, it can transparently <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/new-heatwave-is-coming">make an existing MySQL database 1000x faster</a> without any effort from the customer and avoid ETLs across databases. We’ve already reviewed the service about a year ago, when it was announced publicly, but the company continued to add new features to provide customers with a scalable, robust offering and make optimizations for enhanced performance ever since.</p>
<p>For example, with support for real-time elasticity and compression, MySQL HeatWave is now suitable for even larger (or smaller) data volumes. And auto-reload and auto-recovery capabilities ensure consistent availability even after upgrades or failures. But most importantly, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/mysql-heatwave-on-aws-2022-09-12/">MySQL HeatWave is now also available on AWS</a> in addition to OCI.</p>
 If the mountain will not come to Muhammad… 
<p>How exactly does it work? Well, as an old proverb goes, “If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain”. While many customers of AWS do migrate to OCI to run MySQL HeatWave, for many customers this can be expensive due to high AWS egress fees. To accommodate such customers, the MySQL HeatWave service is offered as a native AWS service. The data plane, control plane, and interactive console are optimized and deployed on AWS infrastructure as a fully managed service supported by the MySQL engineering team. Through the new interactive console, users can issue queries, monitor performance and resource utilization, manage Autopilot, and access their AWS account.</p>
<p>Customers can provision a new MySQL HeatWave instance on AWS with a few clicks with a similar user experience as on OCI before, but at all times, their data and network traffic will be confined to the AWS cloud, with the expected low latency for any application running there as well. Oracle refers to this as a “native experience.” I’m not sure if I can agree with this statement, since HeatWave isn’t (yet?) integrated into the AWS console, and there is no consolidated support and billing like Oracle offers with Azure. However, it works with AWS CloudWatch, S3, PrivateLink and we can expect it to be integrated with a growing number of other native AWS services in the future.</p>
<p>Oracle claims that MySQL HeatWave runs 20x faster than Amazon Redshift (which is AWS’s own managed PostgreSQL service and running on AWS’ own infrastructure). However, as an analyst focused on cybersecurity and data protection, I’m more interested in the fact that HeatWave is a fully self-contained database service – there is no need to move data between different database engines to support analytics or machine-learning workloads. This feature alone has massive <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc71275/database-and-big-data-security">security and compliance benefits</a>. In addition, Oracle has brought advanced security features to MySQL HeatWave on AWS such as data masking, de-identification, asymmetric encryption support, and MySQL firewall, making sensitive data even more secure—all within the database.</p>
<p>The availability of MySQL HeatWave on AWS is great news for everyone dreaming of the future where cloud providers eliminate walls between each other and make their services available wherever customers want them. HeatWave offers users a unique combination of the familiar MySQL experience with Oracle’s latest developments in machine learning, automation, and security. Now all this is available for AWS customers not only without the latency and data egress overhead and fees of a multi-cloud architecture, but also with the ability for customers to tightly integrate with existing AWS services. The HeatWave is spreading; it’s available on OCI, AWS, and will next be available on Azure. With so many cloud choices—as well as an on-premises cloud deployment option with Dedicated Region – what’s not to like?</p>

<p>Anticapture? Capture-Resistance? Uncapturable? </p><p>We’ll get to these in a moment, but first: What is Capture?</p><p>“In politics, regulatory capture … is a form of corruption of authority that occurs when a political entity, policymaker, or regulator is co-opted to serve the commercial, ideological, or political interests of a minor constituency, such as a particular geographic area, industry, profession, or ideological group.” <br>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">Wikipedia, Regulatory capture</a></p><p>More broadly we can think of capture as a type of control or corruption where a small group gains inordinate power over others and their interests. Whether that is capture of a resource, a process, or the flow of communication, a powerful minority takes control of the benefits of something that should be held in common.</p><p>Following we are going to look at a few different forms of capture and methods for avoiding it.</p> Anticapture “The four phases of action in the Anticapture framework. Note how each phase is itself composed of smaller instances of all the phases.” — Spencer Graham, Anticapture<p>The <a href="https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ">Anticapture</a> framework proposed by Spencer Graham outlines governance practices for managing shared resources collectively without a fraction of that collective capturing control of the resources. For this he proposes DAOs as an ideally capture-resistant structure, but in doing so he redefines a DAO as: “a network of agents who share common purpose, and are the only ones who hold the power to execute actions that manage a set of shared resources. The core of Graham’s work is focused on the key stages of governance which he outlines as follows. </p><blockquote>Graham outlines governance practices for managing shared resources collectively without a fraction of that collective capturing control of the resources.</blockquote><p>Anticapture describes four stages of decision making:</p>  Propose: delineate the options on the table  Decide: select the preferred option  Execute: put the selected option into action  Evaluate: analyze the impact of the executed action  <p>Of these, Graham sees the greatest security risk in the Execute stage. If the ability to execute action is captured then the resource is also captured. While he is not completely clear about the mechanics, he presents DAOs as addressing this by decentralizing action and giving the community the ability to act autonomously without outside influence (thus avoiding capture from regulators, for instance). </p><p>Assuming that the final execution of any action in a DAO is carried out by smart contracts, then the design of these contracts themselves and the infrastructures that they are built on are risk vectors for capture.</p> Capture Resistance Across the Web <p>Anticapture speaks to the level of the organization, but what of the infrastructures the organization is built on? </p><p>“For the longest time, word was that the Web would free the world; now, it seems as if most of the world wants to liberate the Web.” - Robin Berjon, <a href="https://berjon.com/capture-resistance/">Capture Resistance</a></p><p>The internet itself is a commons, a shared resource and infrastructure we all rely on, but due to its design we have seen many forms of capture overtake the internet, from data mining to market manipulation. Robin Berjon’s article <a href="https://berjon.com/capture-resistance/">Capture Resistance</a> calls for new design standards to ensure that softwares and the underlying infrastructure of our web protocols do not allow for capture. <br><br>Berjon outlines four main attack vectors:</p>  Capability to observe the behavior of users on another business’s products: <br>Data mining, trackers, etc.  Defaults that project power laterally between markets: <br>Default search engines, browsers, and similar.  Intermediation which happens when an entity has power over relations between other entities: <br>Platforms that act as gatekeepers and extract rent from peer transactions.  Opaque mechanisms used in place of open markets: <br>Lack of clear rulesets that are mutually consented to.  <p>Berjon calls into question the institutions and infrastructures of the web, suggesting the need for explicitly capture-resistant designs. These can be brought about through technical shifts like new security standards as well as through regulatory practices like antitrust laws. Above all he suggests that these infrastructures must be “subject to either exit or voice (or both).” That is to say that users need to be co-governors in the systems they interact with and need to be able to leave those systems for better alternatives when they no longer serve them. </p>The internet is not only digital but also infrastructural and institutional and we need to think about capture across every aspect of the system. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/IlxX7xnbRF8">Source</a><p>We can see from this how even anti-institutional projects, like many within the blockchain movement, are subject to capture. For instance, PoW and PoS systems open up opportunities for capture by a minority of miners or stakers. Because a large amount of capital is needed to have real influence and make participation profitable, the governance of these systems can quickly become exclusionary. Here what is captured might not be what gets written to the ledger, but the ledger itself, and thus all the associated rents such as gas fees which are set by these parties and which control who has access to the infrastructure are also captured.</p><blockquote>...users need to be co-governors in the systems they interact with and need to be able to leave those systems for better alternatives when they no longer serve them.</blockquote> Uncapturable (or Unenclosable) <p>Anticapture is an organizational response to capture, and Capture Resistance aims to open conversation between regulators and software architects, adding to this we now introduce an architectural response to capture at a foundational layer of communication.</p><p>After all, capture can also happen through the manipulation of the medium of communication itself. This overlaps heavily with Berjon’s concerns as we’ll see, but is also a vulnerability for the Anticapture framework. If you can’t trust the system you are communicating over, then you can’t trust the decisions you make as an organization. </p><blockquote>In order to make an uncapturable form of writing, we developed Holochain as an open source, data integrity engine for building peer-to-peer apps.</blockquote><p>We term any communications medium that avoids capture by its very nature an uncapturable carrier. For instance, the air through which sound travels is uncapturable (so long as no one invents a cone of silence). Conversely, messages sent by intermediary or through writing can be contorted, lost, or otherwise captured in transit, opening up vulnerabilities in the system. Scaling communication through the air is vastly limited; you can only speak so loudly. So creating a form of scalable communication that is uncapturable is key to addressing the forms of capture introduced by large scale systems and societies. In order to make an uncapturable form of writing, we developed Holochain as an open source, data integrity engine for building peer-to-peer apps. The technical details for how Holochain secures the communication architecture will be described for a general audience in forthcoming materials, but in the meantime we refer you to an alpha draft of our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/blob/whitepaper/holochain.pdf">whitepaper</a>. It is also worth noting that our implementation doesn’t require any centralized servers or a shared global ledger and thus avoids the forms of capture that those systems open up, either in governance and security or in regulation. </p><p>Capture here is about more than just the security of communications. Holochain also ensures that users always possess their own data and can take it into new spaces they create or join. This combats the capture of privatization. </p>The anti-enclosure movement has a lot to teach modern activists fighting against the privatization of public goods like the internet. The image is a depiction of commoners storming London’s Richmond Park.<p>We previously termed this architectural intervention an “<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">unenclosable carrier</a>” in reference to the enclosure of the commons, a term originally referring to the privatization of public land which the commoners of England relied on. However, it can also be used to refer to any privatization of public resources, from literal enclosure with fences to the paywalling of publicly funded research or the patenting of plant genomes. More generally enclosure is a form of capture and so we have shifted our terminology to speak about Holochain as an uncapturable carrier in order to recognize how it serves as a base layer architecture that can support a broader capture-resistant framework.</p> Holochain and Capture Resistance <p>The introduction of an uncapturable carrier provides several tools that can help address the four security threats that Berjon describes. Along with several other <a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=8036267">intrinsic privacy benefits</a>, Holochain’s peer-to-peer data structures break cloud services’ monopoly on data and privacy. This brings its own set of challenges, for instance Holochain’s accountability mechanisms force certain data into the public sphere; but unlike blockchains with their global visibility, the required data transparency only extends to the group level. Similarly, defaults and intermediation are at least in part solved by easy forking of both platform and data in what we call walkaway (a new article on this coming soon). And opaque mechanism design is limited by shared, openly accessible, consented-to rulesets that can be audited by anyone who can read source code. Without offering one totalizing solution, these tools work together to create capture resistant ecosystems from the ground up. No organization building on Holochain can capture the market or underlying infrastructure because we make exit easy and thus provide users the opportunity to build-in voice.</p><blockquote>No organization building on Holochain can capture the market or underlying infrastructure because we make exit easy and thus provide users the opportunity to build-in voice.</blockquote> Holochain and Anticapture <p>This brings us back to governance as users need to be able to govern their shared platforms, communities, and resources. Holochain and uncapturable carriers can help support the Anticapture framework in a number of ways. For one, because anyone can host the software and act directly peer-to-peer without a central server or ledger, the community gains a high level of autonomy. Beyond that, having clear, mutually shared rulesets helps to maintain security and ensure clarity through the varied governance stages. Holochain also follows almost the same process as laid out by Anticapture for changing the internal ruleset of a community, with the execute stage being managed by each agent for themselves autonomously from the rest. Finally, because every action within a Holochain app is signed, it is easy to trace any form of capture that does happen, no matter the stage of governance. This means communities can address any exploits that arise and continually become more capture-resistant. We explored several of these concepts further in a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">recent article</a> if you are interested in learning more.</p> Conclusion <p>While there are several definitions and arenas of capture presented above, they all share a concern for the ways small, powerful groups can take control of a resource that should be held in common by the larger group, community, or society. </p><p>There is a tendency to avoid capture in one area by shifting power to someone or something that is tasked with protecting against that capture. However, that opens up a new opportunity for capture by centralizing power in a new place. Thus we need capture-resistant design across all layers, starting with a strong foundation in the medium of communication.</p><p>There is a lot of work still to be done in capture-resistance. We hope this broad overview of capture and capture-resistance frameworks helps you to think through these issues from multiple angles, holding them all in mind to see where they differ, conflict, and benefit each other.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/#subscribe">Subscribe</a> to be the first to read our upcoming blog on the power of Walkaway.</p>

				  Decentralized identity will improve the passenger experience at every step of the travel ribbon, creating new opportunities for airlines, airports, and the hospitality and tourism sectors  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>For those of us who remember the pre-smartphone era of travel, with long lines and paper tickets, being able to get tickets and boarding passes and negotiate check in from a smartphone has been a transformational way to save time and alleviate stress.</p>
<p>But that was only a first step toward a seamless, digitized travel experience. A second, much bigger leap is now possible, thanks to a new method of using Digital Travel Credentials that was successfully showcased at the 2022 ICAO Trip Symposium in September.</p>
<p>Using technology developed with Indicio, SITA, the world’s leading IT provider for the air transport industry, demonstrated how passenger identity information can be ingested into privacy-preserving, tamper proof verifiable credentials based on the Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) standards set out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for creating a full digital equivalent to a paper passport.</p>
<p>A DTC verifiable credential means that passenger data can be verified as authentic instantly and repeatedly without complex integrations into databases, using third parties to manage verification, or relying on manual checking. With SITA and Indicio’s technology, any government entity can have the power to verify DTC verifiable credentials in a way that enables passenger data to become immediately actionable while preserving passenger privacy.</p>
<p>The verifiable credential solution created by SITA and Indicio will transform check in, boarding, border control—and all aspects of travel that require assured identity verification.</p>
<p>DTCs move digital identity beyond government use</p>
<p>The DTC verifiable credential from SITA and Indicio advances the adoption of automated, biometric, and self-service solutions. DTC verifiable credentials allow travelers to control their personal information in a way that can be digitally verified by both commercial and government entities.</p>
<p>Intended to be as widely accepted as existing passports and usable for purposes beyond the ticket counter, the DTC VC reduces friction at lines for the gate, border crossings, public transportation facilities like airports and cruise terminals, and hospitality sites such as amusement parks and hotels.</p>
<p>The ICAO standard for the DTC is structured as a phased approach, with three types of DTC. These types include the simplest and quickest way to create a digital version of an existing document (Type 1, holder derived via smartphone), a more enhanced and verified digital equivalent of the physical passport (Type 2, state derived via appointment), and a full virtual replacement for the passport (Type 3, state issued).</p>
<p>SITA demonstrated the first use of a Type 1 DTC in a verifiable credential.</p>
<p>DTCs lay a path to business growth</p>
<p>For those already established in the aviation and travel industry, the DTC provides a way to transform passenger experience by making travel seamless. This simplifies travel infrastructure while providing a next generation capacity to combat fraud and enhance data privacy and security.</p>
<p>The interoperable nature of verifiable credentials based on DTCs opens up new opportunities to develop experiences for “trusted” travelers, and to integrate with governments and other industries across different dimensions of travel, tourism, and transport without having to create complex direct integrations.</p>
<p>With immediately actionable data, companies, governments, and organizations of all kinds can reduce friction associated with manual verification of paper documents, improve customer experiences, and offer new services.</p>
<p>DTC verifiable credentials are a simple way to mitigate fraud, comply with data privacy regulations, and integrate with government, airline, and partner travel applications without direct database integrations.</p>
<p>The Digital Travel Credential’s time is now</p>
<p>Digital Travel Credential verifiable credentials can be integrated into existing systems in weeks rather than months. They provide a simplicity of mechanism that existing and alternative solutions lack. Built using open source and on open standards, and supported on both iOS and Android, the DTC verifiable credentials are a sustainable technology supported by a diverse and experienced developer community and a growing list of adoptions and implementations across multiple sectors.</p>
<p>Together with SITA, we see DTC verifiable credentials as providing the simplest, most effective, and robust way to advance the digital transformation of travel and significantly enhance the passenger experience. Our goal with SITA is to make it as easy as possible to enact DTC standards through a full, open source technical solution.</p>

<p>As the teenager taking credit for last week’s Uber hack so ably demonstrated, threat actors have found an unlikely accomplice in multifactor authentication. But how did cyberattackers manipulate MFA instead of getting thwarted by it? And what can be done to stop this from happening again?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the problem isn’t that the ridesharing giant didn’t have MFA in place. The larger problem is that it wasn’t the right type. To understand what I mean, let’s start with the attack itself.</p>
 ‘Push’ Panic: Ambushed by MFA Requests 
<p>Call it MFA Fatigue, MFA Push Attack, Notification Numbness, or Authentication Exhaustion. By whatever name, the Uber hack followed what has become a well-worn tactic in countless corporate breaches. Based on the <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/09/3-tips-for-mitigating-the-uber-hack/">reporting so far</a> at least, the hacker claims to have stolen an employee’s password and then bypassed the system’s MFA challenge by repeatedly sending push requests to the employee, who seems to have eventually accepted.</p>
<p>The attacker reportedly used this access to infiltrate Uber’s VPN, where they then sent push notifications as if they were the employee, granting themselves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/19/how-to-fix-another-uber-breach/">persistent access</a> to Uber’s systems. Eventually, they gained entry to a share drive that contained PowerShell scripts, from which they pilfered admin credentials to Uber’s privileged access management (PAM) service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re talking serious Kid-in-a-Candy-Store territory here—where the treats (i.e., corporate secrets) come in packages marked G-Suite, VMware, Duo, AWS, and Slack. According to SecurityBoulevard.com, it even included IdP, the company’s OneLogin Identity Provider.</p>
<p>In this instance, defeating MFA doesn’t appear to have required malware, man-in-the-middle attacks, or other technical measures. Instead, the attacker, who’s said to lead the Lapses$ cybercrime group, leveraged sly social engineering tactics. But to be clear, Uber is hardly alone. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uber-links-breach-to-lapsus-group-blames-contractor-for-hack/">Recent attacks</a> targeting Okta, Twitter, Rockstar Games, Mailchimp, Robinhood and others employed similar techniques.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
 Fixing MFA: From Here to Identity 
<p>The problem is with MFA itself—at least the kind used by most organizations.</p>
<p>While once upon a time usernames and passwords kept corporate secrets secure, they long ago became easy pickings through phishing attacks, spyware, and breach-fueled dark web marketplaces. MFA was meant to solve that by adding at least one other factor to authentication. For a time, that involved a one-time passcode (OTP) sent to the authorized user’s mobile device to confirm they were attempting to access corporate systems.</p>
<p>But cybercriminals learned how to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/how-1-time-passcodes-became-a-corporate-liability/">combine tactics</a> that capture not just usernames and passwords into phishing sites but also any OTPs sent as part of the authentication process. The next best step was to send the user a notification about an attempted login, allowing the legitimate user to acknowledge it was, in fact, them logging in. For far too many organizations, that hasn’t ended well.</p>
<p>The problem: Most forms of MFA have been built around a device, instead of the identity of the person using the device. By contrast, next-gen MFA solutions that leverage <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards use biometric markers tied to a registered smartphone to provide reliable, identity-based authentication that’s impervious to impersonation and account takeover.</p>
 Proof of Liveness—Moving Beyond Device-Level Access 
<p>With our own <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-mfa/">next-gen MFA solution</a>, for instance, the device becomes the possession element (what you have), while a live facial scan becomes the inherence element (what you are). To access a network, a system, or an account, a live facial scan is performed to confirm the person attempting to login is in fact the authorized user. No OTPs or push notifications required. In fact, no usernames or passwords required, either.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not only does 1Kosmos prevent account takeover, it can also be strengthened by learning the user behind the device by scanning a driver’s license, passport, or another form of government-issued identification to verify the identity at every access attempt—preventing unauthorized account access and fraudulent enrollment. An attack like the one that compromised Uber’s systems and those of so many other companies becomes impossible if the authentication request is initiated by the user and verified by their live biometrics.</p>
<p>To prevent the next Uber hack, all entry points within an environment must be managed by a system where user access is tied to the user, rather than to a device. 1Kosmos solutions deliver this. In fact, it’s the first and only NIST-, FIDO2-, and<a href="https://www.ibeta.com/"> iBeta biometrics</a>-certified platform on the market. And it’s used to perform millions of authentications daily for some of the world’s largest banks, telecommunications, and healthcare organizations.</p>

<p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! A lot to cover this week, from Indonesia’s plan to turn on the heat against crypto exchanges to the US Treasury’s open call for public comments on crypto regulations. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Indonesia Introduces New Stricter Rules for Crypto Exchanges <p>Indonesia is preparing to tighten the regulation of digital asset exchanges, officials from the country’s Minister of Trade and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) said at a parliamentary hearing in&nbsp;Jakarta.</p><blockquote>Under the revised regulatory framework, two-thirds of directors on digital trading platforms must be Indonesian citizens residing in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><p>“That way, at least we can prevent the top management from fleeing the country if any problem arises,” Didid Noordiatmoko, acting head of Bappebti, told parliament.</p><p>Crypto exchanges will also be required to use a third party to store client funds and prohibited from re-investing stored crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Deputy Minister of Trade Jerry Sambuaga said Bappebti would be issuing new rules soon but didn’t give a specific timeframe.</p><p>He also confirmed that the government is still planning to launch a crypto bourse, which has been delayed several times this&nbsp;year.</p> EU Finalizes Legal text for Crypto Regulations, Covering Stablecoins &amp;&nbsp;NFT <p>The European Union has reportedly finalized the full text of its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, although it is still open to comments.</p><blockquote>Once passed into law, MiCA will require crypto issuers to publish white papers, including technical roadmaps, stablecoin issuers to hold capital and be prudently managed, and platforms to register with the authorities.</blockquote><p>The latest draft of the bill also covers algorithmic stablecoins, which were previously excluded from MiCA’s scope when it was first introduced in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The reason behind it is pretty apparent. Algorithmic stablecoins have gained notoriety since TerraUSD (UST) lost its peg to the US dollar, bringing Terra’s entire ecosystem to its knees, with Luna’s value dropping by almost&nbsp;90%.</p><blockquote>This is why the draft highlights that algorithmic stablecoins should fall within the scope of regulation “irrespective of how the issuer intends to design the crypto asset, including the mechanism to maintain a stable&nbsp;value.”</blockquote><p>When it comes to NFTs, the draft says, the issuance of “non-fungible tokens in a large series or collection should be considered as an indicator of their fungibility.”</p> The UK Introduces New Law to Seize, Freeze, and Recover Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK has introduced the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill to make it easier and quicker for law enforcement agencies to seize, freeze, and recover crypto assets when used for criminal activities.</p><p>The 250-page bill, first promised in May, builds on an earlier Economic Crime Act that helped regulators place sanctions on Russia and covers more than just&nbsp;crypto.</p><blockquote>“Domestic and international criminals have for years laundered the proceeds of their crime and corruption by abusing U.K. company structures and are increasingly using cryptocurrencies,” said director general of the National Crime Agency, Graeme Biggar, in a statement.</blockquote><p>“These reforms — long-awaited and much welcomed — will help us crack down on&nbsp;both.”</p> US Treasury Seeks Public Comment on Crypto Regulation <p>The US Treasury Department has invited the public to comment on how digital assets are used in illegal activities and how the government should respond to&nbsp;them.</p><p>It listed over 20 questions covering CBDC, the risks posed by NFTs, and what the government can do to prevent crimes related to&nbsp;DeFi.</p><blockquote>“The growing use of digital assets in financial activity heightens risks of crimes such as money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption,” states the document.</blockquote><p>“These illicit activities highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny of the use of digital assets, the extent to which technological innovation may impact such activities, and exploration of opportunities to mitigate these risks through regulation, supervision, public-private engagement, oversight, and law enforcement.”</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! <p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate into the Veriscope mainnet by September 30,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope. This offer will remain valid until December 31, 2022, or till the VASP exhausts its SHFT&nbsp;grant.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/shyft-dao-approves-veriscope-vasp-grant-proposal-to-enable-free-fatf-travel-rule-transactions-77e51d735cd6">https://medium.com/shyft-network/shyft-dao-approves-veriscope-vasp-grant-proposal-to-enable-free-fatf-travel-rule-transactions-77e51d735cd6</a></p> Meet us at Token2049! <p>Shyft Network’s Head of Strategy, Malcolm Wright, will be attending Token2049 on September 29 at 9:15 AM.

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity development experts <a href="https://tanglelabs.io" title="Blog">Tangle Labs</a> have just released the latest version of their open-source <a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager" title="Identity Manager libraries">Identity Manager libraries</a> that provide accessible development tools for businesses and organisations to create anything with Identity. </p>



<p>Making use of the <a href="https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/decentralized_identity" title="IOTA Identity protocols">IOTA Identity protocols</a> that are live on the main network of the <a href="https://iota.org" title="IOTA DLT">IOTA DLT</a>, Identity Manager provides a developer friendly environment with additional features that can get enterprise developers exploring Identity in minutes. Abstracting away from the intricate functionality of identity, the tooling provides full exposure of the features in a simplified manner.</p>



 Get Up &amp; Running With SSI in 15mins! 



 



<p> </p>



 Why Do We Need Identity Manager? 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity is becoming a clear topic of discussion at the highest levels of international governments and organisations, yet the current technological barriers to entry provide numerous challenges for SMEs, Institutions, and Enterprises, when entering into the space. As an open-source library, Identity Manager provides developers and teams with and accessible developer tool kit with countless additional features that can support enterprise use-cases and real world deployment of Self-Sovereign Identity solutions.</p>



<p>A fundamental part of all Tangle Labs products the Identity Manager was developed to make identity more comprehensive and approachable for more casual developers and teams working with SSI, without the need to dive in too deep. Making use of sane defaults and helper functions to support quick and versatile deployments and application development. The initial development was specifically to help support the work on the SSI powered <a href="https://tixit.live" title="Tixit">Tixit</a> applications, after realising that Identity protocols can be overwhelming for the majority of developers who are not too familiar with its concepts. </p>



<p>By producing an accessible, open-source wrapper library, Tangle Labs provides any business or development team the opportunity to easily explore SSI and to test and prototype solutions that can bring added value to your business. With an increasing interest in the future of identity online, and with SSI being at the forefront of research for major institutions and organisations, Identity Manager provides the opportunity for any business to get ahead of the game in developing novel identity solutions specific to your use-case.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 What is Self-Sovereign Identity? 



<p>In the sharing of digital data, SSI fosters trust. The user has discretion over what information, including personal information, is shared and with whom. For instance, the recipient can rapidly check the legality and authenticity of shared information electronically. For this, cryptographic tools like public-key cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and distributed ledger technologies are used. This makes it possible for parties who do not naturally trust each other to share verified digital information quickly and with a high level of trust.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 Governments &amp; Businesses Save Money &amp; Time 



<p>Data sharing is now safer, simpler, and more dependable thanks to SSI. This benefits not only consumers but also businesses and government agencies. Companies can more easily abide by the eIDAS2 rule and the European Union’s GDPR thanks to SSI. Additionally, they spend less time and money. The requirement to review documents on paper is no longer necessary, saving billions of euros in administrative expenses, in addition, quicker and better decision-making results in higher customer satisfaction.</p>



<p> </p>



 



The Self-Sovereign Identity Ecosystem using Identity Manager



<p> </p>



 



 How Does Identity Manager Improve Developer Experiences? 



<p>With numerous levels of complexity within the IOTA Identity libraries, getting started can be a daunting task. Where Identity Manager helps is in its abstracting away the complexity of certain features through standard, customisable, defaults, to present developers with a more manageable Typescript environment to promote faster and easier development processes.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 What Value Does Identity Manager Bring to Business? 



<p>With such bodies as the European Commission, British Government, US Government, and other institutions and organisations actively researching and developing SSI based solutions, it is only a matter of time before the use of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) become common practise. In a world where development is fast paced and in many cases expensive, the Identity Manager provides a serious entry point into the technology without the complexities of extensive development processes and specialist developer requirements. Helping businesses explore the boundaries of the tech with ease and short timeframes.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 How Does Identity Manager Expand Upon the IOTA Identity Protocol? 



<p>Having one of the most complex decentralised identity libraries around, the IOTA Identity protocol can be a challenge to navigate, and whilst it focuses on a number of core principals and feature sets to support extensive versatility in the use and deployment of SSI solutions, there are a few areas out of scope, that have been integrated into the Identity Manager to support real world use cases. </p>



<p> </p>



 



 Additional features include: 



<p>DVID – Domain Verifiable Identity, making use of DNS and inspired by DKIM, DVID allows a verifiable credential to be signed and verified not only through its issuers DID, but also through its issuer’s domain through the use of DNS connected DID. Providing a built in human identifiable verification process.</p>



<p>Storage Interface – Through the addition of a storage interface, Identity Manager can easily allow developers to quickly adapt the technology to any data storage paradigm, allowing for ease of management of your identity and credentials through the built in MongoDB or File System solutions, or through any number of additional data storage options such as Postgress, SQL, Cassandra, etc.</p>



<p>Credential Encryption – There are currently no suggested guidelines for the encryption of data in the IOTA Identity protocols, which has been included in the Identity Manager toolkit. Ensuring an identity is fully supported with encrypted credential storage accessible through ownership DID key access. Supporting users with safe storage of their PII only accessible through your private key.</p>



<p>Backup &amp; Restore – A big concern when it comes to identity is backing up and restoration of data when something goes wrong. You break a phone, your laptop burns out, any number of things can add to the loss of data. Identity Manager supports easy user backup and restoration for peace of mind, allowing identity holders to safely be able to restore identity configurations, credentials, keys, and more.</p>



<p>Typescript Library – Without the need to delve into low level Rust code, the Identity Manager libraries have been developed in Typescript to provide an accessible developer entry point to SSI through fully documented code that offers an easy access point to the technology for any development team.</p>

 How to Get Started.  



<p>You can find the full repo live on <a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager" title="Github">Github</a></p>



<p>Identity Manager is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanglelabs/identity-manager" title="">published on NPM</a>&nbsp;and can be easily installed using</p>



 <code>$ yarn add @tanglelabs/identity-manager</code> 



<p>or</p>



 <code>npm install @tanglelabs/identity-manager</code> 



<p>a few examples can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager/tree/dev/docs/examples">examples folder</a>&nbsp;along with the fully detailed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager/tree/dev/docs/api-ref.md">API Reference</a></p>



<p>Identity Manager uses IOTA Identity’s Stronghold bindings to securely store your keypair. The manager instance handles everything related to Stronghold and secrets while the <code>IdentityAccount</code> which is returned with loading or creating a DID handles everything related to a DID and credentials.</p>



<p>Here is an example for how to create an identity using IdentityManager.</p>



 <code>import { IdentityManager } from "@tanglelabs/identity-manager";async function run() {&nbsp; // Instantiate a new instance of Identity Manager&nbsp; const manager = IdentityManager.newInstance({&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filepath: process.env.FILEPATH,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password: process.env.PASSWORD,&nbsp; });&nbsp; // Create a did with the alias of `identity-alias`&nbsp; const did = await manager.createDid("identity-alias");}run();
</code> 



 



<blockquote><p>Please note: </p>Identity Manager v0.2.0 is an alpha release and has not undergone any professional audit or security evaluation. It is meant to be used as an entry point into the technology and is released as is. Please use at your own discretion and not in a real world scenario.</blockquote><p>The post <a href="https://tanglelabs.io/identity-manager-self-sovereign-identity-made-simple/">Identity Manager – Self Sovereign Identity made Simple</a> first appeared on <a href="https://tanglelabs.io">TangleLabs</a>.</p>

			<p>26th September 2022, Luxembourg – <a href="http://www.tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, the Luxembourg-based tokenization platform, today announced a partnership with <a href="https://ownera.io/">Ownera</a>, provider of a global inter-trading network based on the open-source FinP2P protocol, to distribute tokenized assets over the Ownera FinP2P network.</p>
<p>The digital securities industry is growing fast but has lacked a common global distribution network for connecting issuers, investors, exchanges, and other market participants. As a result, the rate of institutional adoption and investor access to high-quality digital assets has been limited up until now.</p>
<p>Ownera brought the industry together to develop the FinP2P open-source routing protocol to solve this problem by orchestrating the instant exchange of digital assets held on any blockchain platform, for digital cash held on any ledger. It supports primary issuance, secondary trading and DeFi-style instant borrowing against assets pledged as collateral.&nbsp; This routing network has the power to open up digital distribution for the private markets and unlock global liquidity in a way that no single institution or exchange can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>As the market leader in tokenization solutions, Tokeny’s technology has enabled direct transfers and settlements of tokenized assets in a compliant manner, by default. Its infrastructure uses the market standard ERC-3643 to ensure each transfer can only be triggered between eligible investors through ONCHAINID, a digital identity system, enabling the transferability of tokenized assets. The integration of Ownera FinP2P distribution network enables its clients to further improve the liquidity of their tokenized assets by reaching a broader investor base across the globe.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenization is the first step to unlock the full potential of assets using blockchain technology. When assets are brought onchain, they can be transferred and managed by their owners, at a lower cost, and in real-time. As the compliance is built in at the token level, visibility and interoperability is the key to maximize asset liquidity. By integrating Ownera’s FinP2P, we allow our clients and their investors to connect to additional distribution networks, and use tokenized assets for collateralization.  Daniel CoheurChief Strategy Officer of Tokeny       Institutions have been faced with the challenge of deploying multiple blockchain technologies if they want to access different isolated pools of assets and investors. The adoption of FinP2P will result in higher liquidity and better access to capital and assets by providing regulated firms with one secure point of connection to multiple digital asset networks across the globe. Any institution deploying a Tokeny solution now has the potential to access the added distribution capabilities of the Ownera FinP2P network.  Anthony WoolleyHead of Business Development and Marketing at Ownera

Cyber hygiene is a set of regular practices that intend to keep systems, networks, sensitive data, and users secure against cyberattacks, data breaches, and data loss.</p>
<p>Good cyber hygiene practices help organizations locate unmanaged assets, gain visibility into the software installed, safeguard against ransomware and malware, avoid phishing attempts, audit administrative privileges, protect customer data, and achieve regulatory compliance. As a concept, cyber hygiene has increased in significance since the mass adoption of remote and home office practices or “WfA (Work from Anywhere”) after Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Embracing a cyber hygiene strategy resembles a person building new habits to work safer. Much like personal habits, organizations have cultures. Cyber hygiene routines must be a shared responsibility that all departments and users take part in. Thus, good cyber hygiene practice requires every stakeholder’s participation. This can be done by incorporating cyber hygiene strategies into organizations’ cybersecurity culture. Such strategies can include practices like using the right cybersecurity tools, keeping applications and software up to date, using MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), implementing <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">ZTNA</a> (Zero-Trust Network Access), creating organization-wide password policies, and developing a backup strategy.</p>
<p>Common Problems</p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/2022-cybersecurity-forecasts-predict-growth-emphasizing-resilience/">Despite the increase in cybersecurity spendings</a>, organizations continue suffering from cyberattacks. With varying attack vectors targeting different components of organizations’ IT (Information Technology) environment, such as hardware, software, and applications, lack of cyber hygiene can result in various problems. Some of the common cyber hygiene problems include:</p>
<p>Security Breaches: Data is one of the most valuable assets of modern organizations. Failing to protect sensitive data, organizations often end up with data theft and expensive ransomware payouts. Poor vulnerability management and weak security policies can expose organizations to security threats like phishing, malware, and viruses.</p>
<p>Data Loss: When local and online storage are not regularly backed up and maintained, important data can be lost through hardware failure, data corruption, improper configuration, and theft.</p>
<p>Software Vulnerabilities: Software and applications should be updated regularly, ensuring that the latest security patches and the latest versions are in use across the organization for all kinds of applications and software. Otherwise, out-of-date programs may have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Poor patch management and old or out-of-date software are a common cause of data breaches at organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Following cyber hygiene best practices, organizations can leverage their cybersecurity culture. Providing guidelines to security teams, these practices must be implemented across all the users. After identifying the cybersecurity gaps in an organization, a security awareness program can be implemented to support all stakeholders with their security skills.</p>
<p>Utilizing the right Cybersecurity Tools: </p>
<p>Finding the right tool is an essential part of cyber hygiene to ensure network and data security. Some of the cybersecurity tools include:</p>
 
 Endpoint Detection, Protection, and Response (EPDR): Organizations must protect not only their internal networks, but also all users at all connected endpoints. Endpoint security has evolved from traditional antivirus solutions to delivering comprehensive detection and prevention of different forms of malware and zero-day threats. Apart from malware detection and protection, EPDR solutions often ship with capabilities, such as endpoint firewall, URL filtering, allowlisting/blocklisting as well as alerting and reporting mechanisms. 
 Secure Remote Access: Secure Remote Access solutions are designed to prevent unauthorized access to resources and data loss. A variety of solutions like VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), CASBs (Cloud Access Security Brokers), and ZTNA can help organizations facilitate secure network connection for users regardless of their physical location. 
 Encryption: Using cryptographic methods can provide sensitive data protection while data is in transit and at rest. 
 
<p>Stepping up to Secure Authentication: </p>
<p>Requiring MFA for all logins can reduce the risks arising from compromised credentials. MFA offers an extra protection layer to organizations’ cybersecurity. Biometric authentication methods like facial recognition and fingerprint scanners can also provide secure and robust authentication. As password-based threats continue to rise, organizations should go beyond username/password and consider strong passwordless multi-factor authentication solutions.</p>
<p>Performing Regular Backups: </p>
<p>Backing up the data to a secondary location regularly can protect organizations against accidental mistakes, natural disasters, and cyber incidents, such as malware as well as physical and logical damage to the storage devices. To avoid such events, organizations must develop a data backup strategy and ensure that the data backups are protected against unauthorized access through air gaps, immutable storage, and encryption.

<p>In the wake of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">DWeb Camp</a>, some internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a> and <a href="https://press.holo.host/217917-holochain-apps-published-on-holo-network">Holo testing</a>, and other chances to test Holochain in the real world, the Holochain core dev team has been troubleshooting and fixing performance issues in Holochain’s network protocol.</p> Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.0.159: Gossip rate limiting bump <p>Release date: 6 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20, 0.0.21<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148, 0.0.149</p><p>This release optimises a hard-coded rate limit on gossip, bringing it from 0.5mbps for recent data and 0.1mbps for historic data, up to 10mbps for all data, with a burst limit of 1gb in a 10-second window. The burst limit is also now tunable from the conductor config. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1543">#1543</a>)</p><p>You may ask, why was the limit so tiny? Gossip mainly supports the resilience of data, a sort of price you pay for the privilege of participating in a network. We didn’t want it to be too painful, especially for people on slow connections. However, 0.1mbps was a bit too gentle and was preventing large entries from ever being gossiped. We recognise that most people have more spare bandwidth than that, and can even accept occasional spikes in traffic. This change has already improved performance of data-heavy hApps like DevHub.</p><p>There are some other small changes:</p>  Bugfix: Too-large gossip payloads could put the rate limiter into an infinite loop, preventing historical data from being gossiped even with higher bandwidth limits.  The conductor now tries to reconnect to the Lair keystore process, with backoff. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1529">#1529</a>)  The Lair keystore gives out separate TLS certificates to different conductors running on the same machine. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1519">#1519</a>)  All of the HDI and HDK types related to validation have had their members made public. This doesn’t break compatibility with previous HDIs and HDKs; it simply improves autogenerated documentation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1450">#1450</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1452">#1452</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1457">#1457</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1458">#1458</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220907014838">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.160: HDI 0.1.0 <p>Release date: 7 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20 to 0.1.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148 to 0.0.150</p><p>Nothing has changed in this release except a version bump: the <code>hdi</code>, or ‘Holochain Deterministic Integrity’ crate, has gone from version 0.0.x to 0.1.0. This signals that we think it’s made “significant progress towards stabilizing the deterministic integrity layer’s API”, in the words of Stefan, Holochain’s release manager. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1550">#1550</a>)</p><p>This brings us one step closer to putting the 0.1 stamp on the HDK itself (which includes but is broader than the HDI) and calling it stable for coding and validation. Expect a little bit of API churn yet before we hit that <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/">milestone</a> :)</p> Holochain 0.0.161: Gossip bug fix <p>Release date: 8 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20 to 0.1.1<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148 to 0.0.151</p><p>Bugfix: This release continues gossip reliability, fixing a bug in which a node can prematurely end a gossip round even if there’s more to be gossiped. This bug led to persistent timeouts between nodes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1553">#1553</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.162: Cell cloning part 1 <p>Release date: 13 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152</p><p>This release brings a long-awaited feature: the ability to ‘clone’ a cell. In Holochain, a DNA can be cloned, which results in an agent running multiple cells within the same hApp, each spawned from the DNA. Each of these cells has its own DHT, thanks to a different network seed which changes the DNA hash. This lets you create many separate public or private spaces that share the same functionality. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1547">#1547</a>)</p><p>The new conductor API call that supports this is called <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.CreateCloneCell"><code>create_clone_cell</code></a>, found in the app API, and it <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.56/holochain_types/app/struct.CreateCloneCellPayload.html">takes</a> the installed app ID, the role of the cell to be cloned, a new network seed, properties, and origin time, and optionally a membrane proof and cell name. (Note: the network seed, properties, and origin time are all optional and are contained in a struct called <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.56/holochain_types/prelude/struct.DnaPhenotypeOpt.html"><code>DnaPhenotypeOpt</code></a>. However, these properties become part of the parent object in their serialised form, making <code>DnaPhenotypeOpt</code> disappear. We realise this is surprising and undocumented, and we’re working on a clearer approach. So be aware that there will probably be breaking changes soon.)</p><p>Here are the rest of the changes:</p>  Breaking (host API): You can now order results in a chain query descending (newest to oldest); the default is still ascending (oldest to newest). <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.152/hdk/prelude/struct.ChainQueryFilter.html">ChainQueryFilter</a></code> has <code>.ascending()</code> and <code>.descending()</code> convenience functions in its builder API. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1539">#1539</a>)  Breaking (conductor admin API): The <code>add_records</code> API endpoint has been changed to <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.0.59/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.GraftRecords"><code>graft_records</code></a>, with modified functionality. You probably won’t have used this endpoint unless you’re working on a source chain backup or replication service, but just in case! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1538">#1538</a>)  New (app API): The <code>app_info</code> endpoint now includes cloned cells. This is a non-breaking change; they just show up in the existing <code>cell_data</code> field of the response. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1547">#1547</a>)  Removed (conductor config): Legacy Lair keystore config options have been removed. These options have been non-functional for a while. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1571">#1571</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220914013149">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.163: Maintenance <p>Release date: 21 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152, 0.0.153</p><p>This is a small release:</p>  Bugfix: A rare ‘Arc is not quantizable’ panic is now a warning. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1577">#1577</a>)  Breaking (Sweettest): If you use Sweettest, the Rust-based testing framework, some of the functionality that deals with inline zome has been changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1575">#1575</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220921145054">changelog</a>.</p> Known issues   There are still some reliability and performance issues with gossiping, especially for large entries.   Very rarely, the WebSocket for the conductor admin API will close.  The JavaScript and Rust clients haven’t been updated for the changes in the conductor APIs.   Future breaking change warning <p>Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#how-to-secure-functions-against-unauthorized-use">capability-based security model</a> means that all zome calls need to be authenticated by a valid capability. So far, the conductor has been giving a free pass to zome calls made by clients via the WebSocket app API, treating them as equivalent to the ‘author’ capability. But in the future, these zome calls will all need to supply their own capability.</p><p>For the most part, this won’t be a hassle. If you mean for your hApp to be hosted in the Launcher or the Holo hosting network, it’ll all be taken care of behind the scenes. The only remaining scenario is UIs that access Holochain over WebSocket ports, which will probably use some sort of UI password to authenticate. We’ll give details about refactoring your hApp when the time comes.</p> Holochain Launcher release notes  Launcher 0.6.0: Large hApps in DevHub <p>Release date: 14 September 2022</p><p>This release adds support for Holochain 0.0.162, which includes the cumulative bugfixes for gossip of large entries. This means that hApps in the DevHub are more likely to be accessible when you try to download and install them.</p><p>Here are the rest of the changes:</p>  Support for everything before Holochain 0.0.162 / HDI 0.1.1 / HDK 0.0.152 has been dropped.  The database is now encrypted at rest. This means that databases created with older versions of the Launcher are incompatible with the new one; you’ll need to create a new key and reinstall all your hApps.  Compatibility with Ubuntu Linux 22.04 has been improved.  There have been various bugfixes and UX improvements.  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.6.0">changelog</a>.</p> Launcher 0.6.1: Debugging improvements <p>Release date: 21 September 2022</p><p>This release adds niceties for people who are debugging Holochain or hApps; custom conductors are now distinguished from built-in ones in the log, and other error messages and pieces of info are clearer.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.6.1">Read the full changelog and download the latest installer</a>!</p> hREA hits major milestone release <p><a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a>, the project that implements the <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a> economic vocabulary as a set of Holochain libraries, has hit its Sapling release, version <a href="https://github.com/h-REA/hREA/releases/tag/happ-0.1.0-beta">0.1.0-beta</a>. Connor, Pegah, and Wes at <a href="https://sprillow.com">Sprillow</a>, along with longtime lead developer Pospi, have completed the work that they believe was necessary to help hREA get to a state that developers can start hacking hApps with, submitting feedback on, and building a community around.

<blockquote>With its comprehensive framework for crypto assets, the White House called for a “more aggressive push by regulators to take on fraud in the&nbsp;sector.”</blockquote><blockquote>The White House also urged authorities to double down on their efforts to develop the “Digital Dollar,” as it will significantly benefit the country’s financial sector.</blockquote><blockquote>The Secretary of the US Treasury, Janet Yellen, that if all the risks that digital assets pose are dealt with, the industry will offer significant opportunities.</blockquote><p>The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/">released</a> a first-of-its-kind framework in the US for the “responsible development” of digital assets as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/11/16-of-americans-say-they-have-ever-invested-in-traded-or-used-cryptocurrency/">16%</a> of adult Americans own crypto, and its global market capitalization reached <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/crypto-world-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-as-ether-bitcoin-gain">$3 trillion</a> at its&nbsp;peak.</p><p>Although the user numbers may have come down from the peak, it still holds strong despite the crypto winter, ready to surge again with growing adoption of Web3, DeFi, and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><blockquote>The framework calls for a “more aggressive push by regulators to take on fraud in the sector,” based on its nine reports that make recommendations on protecting consumers, investors, financial stability of businesses, the environment, and national security.</blockquote> The White House’s&nbsp;Concerns <p>Amid Russia Ukraine war, the White House was particularly concerned about sanctioned individuals and entities turning to digital assets to circumvent the sanctions. On top of that, an increasing number of crypto hacks and rug pulls and a considerable drop in the global digital market cap added fire to the&nbsp;fury.</p><p>Speaking of hacks, the most notable one that irked the US regulators was a $625 million Ronin Bridge attack, reportedly carried out by a North Korean group known as&nbsp;Lazarus.</p> A Series of&nbsp;Actions <p>What followed next were a series of strict measures by the US government and authorities, the most notable one being the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)’s sanctions against Tornado Cash, popular crypto mixing service. Recently, the OFAC also <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1570442274039042055?t=9j5gCmxuk8AXLPsyrrj7Sg&amp;s=19">released FAQs</a> in relation to its sanctions against Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><blockquote>Despite these tough measures, the White House has indicated that although they are concerned about the misuse of cryptocurrencies by malicious elements, they want to “foster responsible digital asset innovation” with the first-of-its-kind digital assets framework. This is also significant as it comes after President Biden issued an executive order in March this year on the oversight of crypto&nbsp;assets.</blockquote> Covering NFTs&nbsp;Too <p>The report urges the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to “aggressively pursue” investigations as well as enforcement actions against unlawful practices in the crypto space. In addition, it has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to double their efforts to monitor consumer complaints and enforce against unfair practices.</p><p>Moreover, there are plans to call upon Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act to explicitly apply to digital asset service providers, including exchanges and NFT platforms.</p><p>The US Treasury is also set to complete an illicit finance risk assessment on DeFi by February 2023 and an evaluation on NFTs by July&nbsp;2023.</p> Providing Guidance <p>The Office of Science and Technology Policy and NSF will be tasked with developing a Digital Assets Research and Development Agenda.</p><p>The framework meanwhile encourages the Department of Treasury (DOT) and regulators to provide entities in the crypto space with guidance, best-practice information, and technical assistance.</p><p>Janet Yellen, the US Secretary of the Treasury, said that the reports clearly identify the risks and challenges associated with the usage of digital assets for financial services.</p><blockquote>So, “if these risks are mitigated, digital assets and other emerging technologies could offer significant opportunities,” she&nbsp;added.</blockquote><p>According to her, all the reports on digital assets and their recommendations provide a “strong foundation for policymakers” to realize their potential benefits while minimizing the&nbsp;risks.</p> Advocating for a Digital&nbsp;Dollar <p>As for a digital dollar, the Biden administration said a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could “offer significant benefits” to the US financial system. Besides being environmentally sustainable, facilitating faster cross-border transactions, promoting financial inclusion, and fostering economic growth, the White House said, a US CBDC could also help bolster its status as a global leader and support the effectiveness of sanctions.</p><p>The assessment was part of a wide-ranging report on digital assets following the executive order issued earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote>A Treasury Department report published last week on the future of money and payments also advocated for a CBDC, noting a “natural use case” for&nbsp;them.</blockquote> Industry concerns <p>Although many from the industry welcomed the White House’s comprehensive framework on digital assets, some criticized it, noting its overt focus on the risks of digital assets, pretty much ignoring all the benefits it&nbsp;offers.</p><p>For instance, Binance’s CZ appreciated the framework, tweeting, “It’s great to see the US moving towards a proposed crypto framework. Getting it right will help protect consumers, markets and spark responsible innovation.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1570900731506589696">Image Source</a>)<p>He believes federal regulation will benefit the industry compared to the “current patchwork of state laws and regulations that govern this&nbsp;space.”</p><p>Cameron Winklevoss, on the other hand, believes that the framework fails to capture the potential and opportunities that the digital assets landscape presents.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1572245036124831752?s=20&amp;t=ub4apm6OCfnHZsj6xFpImQ">Image Source</a>)<p>He believes that it focuses too much on the risks that cryptocurrencies pose. Instead, he believes, the focus should have been on providing clear “Rules of the Road” over the current “Regulation by Enforcement” approach.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1570761113347977219?s=20&amp;t=ub4apm6OCfnHZsj6xFpImQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Some experts also called out the framework over its anti-Proof-of-Work stance and naming all things crypto as a scam or a&nbsp;threat.</p><p>So, what do you think about this comprehensive framework for digital assets?

You can lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">df.oceandao.org</a> (linked from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean homepage</a>)  Thu Sep 29: Counting for DF resumes. As the previous DF round was DF4 (week 4), counting will start for&nbsp;DF5.  Thu Oct 6: First ve rewards distribution to veOCEAN holders available. Rewards = DF5 payout + cut of Ocean fees. DF6 counting&nbsp;starts.  Thu Oct 13: Next ve distribution: DF6 payout + cut of fees; DF7 counting&nbsp;starts.  Thu Oct 20: Next ve distribution: DF7 payout + cut of fees; DF8 counting starts. And so on, for each&nbsp;week.  <p>DF will follow phases as before. When it resumes, it will be with a new “DF/VE Alpha” phase for 4 weeks. “DF Beta” and “DF Main” phases will follow, as previously targeted. Details are below. As the first phase is alpha, the process may be rough at the beginning; we will iteratively improve this over weeks and months as we evolve from alpha to beta to&nbsp;main.</p><p>veOCEAN holders can claim their rewards distribution via the webapp, or smart contracts directly.</p> 3. Details:&nbsp;veOCEAN  3.1 veOCEAN&nbsp;Overview <p>veOCEAN will operate as described in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">Introducing veOCEAN</a>”. This section gives the highlights.</p><p>ve tokens have been introduced by several projects such as <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a> and <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a>. These tokens require users to lock project tokens in return for ve&lt;project tokens&gt;.</p><p>In exchange for locking tokens, users can earn rewards. The amount of reward depends on how long the tokens are locked for. Furthermore, veTokens can be used for voting in grants DAOs or for asset curation.</p><p>We are rolling out veOCEAN to give token holders the ability to lock OCEAN to earn yield, and curate&nbsp;data.</p><p>People can lock their OCEAN up to 4 years to get veOCEAN. If someone locks 1,000 OCEAN, they get 1,000 OCEAN back at the end, plus rewards along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>veOCEAN supports passive locking of OCEAN by default. Users can get higher yield by active curation of data assets in the DF&nbsp;setting.</p> 3.2 veOCEAN Core&nbsp;Idea <p>The core idea is: lock OCEAN for longer for higher rewards and more voting power. A locker can be passive, though they earn more if&nbsp;active.</p><p>You receive proportionally more veOCEAN for longer lock times, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  lock 1 OCEAN for 1 week → get 0.0048 veOCEAN = 1 / (4 *&nbsp;52)  …  lock 1 OCEAN for 1 year → get 0.25&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 2 years → get 0.50&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 3 year → get 0.75&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 4 years → get 1.0&nbsp;veOCEAN  <p>Critically, veOCEAN cannot be unlocked before the pre-set time. If you’ve locked some OCEAN for a year, you can’t unlock it during that time. Your veOCEAN balance decays linearly over time; the amount of OCEAN you’ll receive when the lock ends will always be equal to the amount you&nbsp;locked.</p><p>You can always extend your lock time or the lock amount. But, lock time can not decreased.</p><p>veOCEAN is non-transferable. You can’t send it to&nbsp;others.</p> 3.3 veOCEAN&nbsp;Earnings <p>veOCEAN holders have earnings from two&nbsp;sources:</p>  Community fees. Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO grants, etc. All earnings here are&nbsp;passive.  Data Farming: veOCEAN holders will get each weekly DF rewards allocation, except a small carveout for DF Crunch. For DF rewards, veOCEAN holders can be passive, though they will earn more if active. “Being active” means allocating veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs). Then, rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * stake. But now, stake is the amount of veOCEAN allocated to the data asset, rather than liquidity in a datatoken pool. (And this stake is safe: you can’t lose your OCEAN as it is merely&nbsp;locked.)  <p>All earnings for veOCEAN holders are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. (Data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon,&nbsp;etc.)</p><p>There’s a new DF round every week; in line with this, there’s a new ve distribution “epoch” every week. This affects when you can first claim rewards. Specifically, if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first ve epoch that begins after day x+7. Put another way, from the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. (This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">Here’s the code.</a>&nbsp;)</p> 3.6 Flow of&nbsp;Value <p>The image below illustrates the flow of value. On the left, at time 0, the user locks their OCEAN into the veOCEAN contract, and receives veOCEAN. In the middle, the veOCEAN holder receives OCEAN rewards every time there’s revenue to the Ocean Protocol Community (top), and also as part of DF rewards (bottom). On the right, when the lock expires (e.g. 4 years) then the user is able to move all their OCEAN around&nbsp;again.</p>Flow of&nbsp;value 4. Details: Data&nbsp;Farming  4.1 DF&nbsp;Overview <p>DF incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to veOCEAN holders who curate towards data assets with high consume volume. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>DF will operate as described in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>”, with a key change: “staking” now means allocating veOCEAN to data assets, rather than LPing into data pools. And veOCEAN means OCEAN is locked for up to four years. Since it doesn’t involve pools (AMMs), there is no risk of impermanent loss. DF now supports fixed-price assets, and free assets (where “price” = gas cost to consume).</p><p>The rest of this section gives the highlights from the&nbsp;post.</p> 4.2 DF&nbsp;Schedule <p>DF has these&nbsp;phases:</p>  [completed] DF Alpha. Counting started Thu June 16, 2022. 10K OCEAN rewards were budgeted per week. Rewards were distributed at the end of every week, for the activity of the previous week. It ran 4&nbsp;weeks.  [new] DF/VE Alpha. Counting starts Thu Sep 29,2022. 10K OCEAN rewards are budgeted per week. Rewards are distributed at the end of every week, for the activity of the previous week. It runs 4 weeks. The aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.  DF Beta. Counting starts Thu Oct 27, 2022. Rewards are up to 100K OCEAN per week. It runs up to 20 weeks. The aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.  DF Main. Immediately follows DF Beta. Rewards are up to 1.6M OCEAN per week. It runs for decades; at least 503.4M OCEAN total is committed.   4.3 DF Reward&nbsp;Function <p>The reward going to a veOCEAN holder for a given Ocean data asset depends on the amount of veOCEAN they allocated to the asset, and how much that asset is being consumed ($ volume). Reward&nbsp;is:</p><p>RFij = Sij *&nbsp;Cj</p><p>where</p>  Sij is amount of veOCEAN that user i has allocated to asset&nbsp;j  Cj is data consume volume for asset j, in&nbsp;$  veOCEAN holders receive rewards pro-rata according to&nbsp;RFij  <p>For priced data, consume volume = Cj = ($ price of asset) x (number of consumes of the asset in the week). DF now handles free data as well, where gas fees act as “price”: Cj = ($ gas paid at time of consume) x (number of consumes of the&nbsp;asset).</p><p>The higher the consume volume, the more the rewards. The more veOCEAN allocated, the more the&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>For a given week, OCEAN rewarded is bounded by the OCEAN budget, and keeping APY ≤&nbsp;125%.</p><p>This is the reward function for the next DF round (DF5). Based on learnings, we can expect it to evolve in rounds that follow DF6, DF7,&nbsp;etc.</p> 4.3 Data Assets that&nbsp;Qualify <p>Data assets that have veOCEAN allocated towards them get DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The data asset may be of any type — dataset (for static URIs) or algorithm for Compute-to-Data. The data asset may be fixed price or free price. If fixed price, any token of exchange is alright (OCEAN, H2O, USDC,&nbsp;..).</p><p>To qualify for DF, a data asset must also&nbsp;:</p>  Have been created by Ocean smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> by OPF to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">production networks</a>  Visible on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Can’t be in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">purgatory</a>   4.4 Data Farming&nbsp;Q&amp;A <p>Q: I staked for just one day. What rewards might I&nbsp;expect?</p><p>At least 50 snapshots are randomly taken throughout the week. If you’ve staked just one day, and all else being equal, you should expect 1/7 the rewards compared to the full 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Q: The datatoken price may change throughout the week. What price is taken in the DCV calculation?</p><p>The price is taken at the same time as each consume. E.g. if a data asset has three consumes, where price was 1 OCEAN when the first consume happened, and the price was 10 OCEAN when the other consumes happened, then the total DCV for the asset is 1 + 10 + 10 =&nbsp;21.</p><p>Q: Can the rewards function change during a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>No. At the beginning of a new DF round (DF1, DF2, etc), rules are laid out, either implicitly if no change from previous round, or explicitly in a blog post if there are new rules. This is: rewards function, bounds, etc. Then teams stake, buy data, consume, etc. And LPs are given DF rewards based on staking, DCV, etc at the end of the week. Overall cycle time is one&nbsp;week.</p><p>Caveat: it’s no at least in theory! Sometimes there may be tweaks if there is community consensus, or a&nbsp;bug.</p> 5. Evolution of&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>With veOCEAN, OceanDAO evolves to be more like <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">CurveDAO</a>:</p>  ve is at the heart with v = voting (in OceanDAO grants) and e = escrowed (locked) OCEAN. The longer the lockup, the more voting and rewards, which reconciles near- and long-term DAO incentives.  The DAO has increased bias to automation, and to minimizing the governance attack surface. The 143.8M OCEAN that was originally earmarked for a DAO treasury will go into DF instead. And, 143.8M OCEAN earmarked for grants will go to DF (&gt;21.5M OCEAN remains for grants). This is on top of 215.7M OCEAN previously allocated&nbsp;. Therefore DF now has 503.4M OCEAN allocated; this is 35.7% of total OCEAN supply (1.41B&nbsp;OCEAN).   6. Walk-Through Numbers <p>This section walks through example numbers. It’s basically the same as in the previous <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">DF launch pos</a>t, because DF/VE Alpha phase has the same parameters as the previous DF Alpha&nbsp;phase.</p><p>The first subsection describes OCEAN disbursement with the most aggressive possible schedule; the subsection after describes a conservative schedule. The likely scenario is somewhere in between. A third subsection describes possible&nbsp;APYs.</p> 6.1 OCEAN Schedule with Aggressive Ramp <p>Here’s a scenario that goes through DF the most aggressively: DF Beta takes 10 weeks and emits 100K OCEAN per week, and each multiplier in DF Main time takes 0 time (goes to 100% multiplier immediately). All plots are computed from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=0">this Google&nbsp;Sheet</a>.</p><p>The image below shows the first half-year for the aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is OCEAN released each week. It’s log-scaled to easily see the differences. The x-axis is time, measured in weeks. Week 0 is Oct 6, 2022. We can see the distinct phases for DF/VE Alpha, DF Beta, then DF&nbsp;Main.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 0.5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below is like the previous one, but now shows for the first five years. DF Main starts at week 14 with full-blown OCEAN emissions. Recall that DF Main emission follows a Bitcoin-style curve where the rewards decrease according to an exponential with a 4-year half-life. With each DM main multiplier taking 0 time, it means that half of all the DF Main rewards are distributed in its first 4&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN released by DF for aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, aggressive ramp 6.2 OCEAN Schedule with Conservative Ramp <p>Here the opposite-extreme scenario, having a highly conservative ramp of DF rewards. DF/VE Alpha runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over four weeks. DF Beta runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over 20 weeks. DF Main starts at the 10% multiplier, transitions to 25% at 12 months, to 50% at 18 months, and to 100% at 24 months. The image below shows the first five&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, conservative ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN emitted for DF. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p><p>DF Beta starts at week 8, where the curve gets steeper. DF Main starts at week 20, where the curve is again more gradual. The curve gets steeper with each multiplier ratchet at weeks 48, 72, and 98, finally arriving at a shape just like the Bitcoin exponential curve.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, conservative ramp 6.3 Example&nbsp;APYs <p>The two tables below show estimated possible APYs, from an upper bound (first table) to lower bound (second table). Both use the observed number of 10M OCEAN staked in the first week. They remain estimates because they make assumptions about staking growth: they assume staking growth rate 20% per week, and reduce by 5% relative after&nbsp;that.</p>Upper bound APYs (approximate), when aggressive OCEAN emissions schedule.Lower bound APYs (approximate), when conservative OCEAN emissions schedule.<p>The tables are calculated from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=187527164">this Google&nbsp;Sheet</a>.</p><p>The numbers assume that all locked OCEAN is locked for 4 years, so that 1 OCEAN → 1 veOCEAN. But APY can vary here too. Here are approximate bounds.</p>  If you lock for 4 years, and everyone else locks for 2, then multiply expected APY by 2. If you lock for 4 years and others for 1, then multiply by&nbsp;4.  Conversely, if you lock for 2 years and everyone else for 4, then divide your expected APY by 2. If you lock for 1 year and others for 4, then divide by&nbsp;4.  The numbers assume that you’re actively allocating veOCEAN allocation towards high-DCV data assets. For passive locking or low-DCV data assets, divide APY by 2 (approximate).   7. On&nbsp;Security <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/main/contracts/ve">veOCEAN core contracts</a> use <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">veCRV contracts</a> with zero changes, on purpose: the veCRV contracts have been battle-tested for two years and have not had security&nbsp;issues.</p><p>We have built <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veAllocate.sol">a new contract</a> for users to point their veOCEAN towards given data assets (“allocate veOCEAN”). These new contracts do not control the veOCEAN core contracts at all. In the event of a breach, the only funds at risk would be the rewards distributed for a single week; and we would be able to redirect future funds to a different contract.</p><p>We have an <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/oceanprotocol/">ongoing bug bounty via Immunefi</a> for Ocean software, including veOCEAN and DF components. If you identify an issue, please report it there and get rewarded.</p> 8. Conclusion <p>veOCEAN goes live on Mon Sep 26, and Data Farming resumes three days later. veOCEAN (with DF) has passive rewards for locking OCEAN for veOCEAN, and higher rewards for veOCEAN holders who actively allocate veOCEAN towards data with high Data Consume Volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p> Appendix: Contract Deployments <p>The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/main/contracts/ve">veOCEAN &amp; DF contracts</a> are deployed to Ethereum mainnet, alongside other Ocean contract deployments. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/addresses/address.json">Full&nbsp;list</a>.</p> {<br> “veOCEAN”: “0xE86Bf3B0D3a20444DE7c78932ACe6e5EfFE92379”,<br> “veAllocate”: “0x55567E038b0a50283084ae773FA433a5029822d3”,<br> “veDelegation”: “0xc768eDF2d21fe00ef5804A7Caa775E877e65A70E”,<br> “veFeeDistributor”: “0x256c54219816603BB8327F9019533B020a76e936”,<br> “veDelegationProxy”: “0x45E3BEc7D139Cd8Ed7FeB161F3B094688ddB0c20”,<br> “veFeeEstimate”: “0xe97a787420eD263583689Bd35B7Db1952A94710d”,<br> “SmartWalletChecker”: “0xd7ddf62257A41cc6cdAd7A3d36e4f1d925fD142a”,<br> “DFRewards”: “0xFe27534EA0c016634b2DaA97Ae3eF43fEe71EEB0”,<br> “DFStrategyV1”: “0x545138e8D76C304C916B1261B3f6c446fe4f63e3”,<br>} <p>veFeeDistributor has a start_time of 1663804800 (Thu Sep 22 2022 00:00:00)</p> Updates <p>Oct 4, 2022: “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-is-going-fully-decentralized-and-autonomous-cb4b725e0360">OceanDAO Is Going Fully Decentralized and Autonomous</a>” was published.

				<p>When my co-founder Tomislav applied to move to a new apartment, they requested his personal information to prove he would be eligible and able to pay rent. He sent in photographs of his government ID, marriage certificate, bank statements, and more. Someone at the rental agency tried to take his information and withdraw his life’s savings from his bank account.<br><br>At Trinsic we’re obsessed with creating a new paradigm that allows people to share personal information in a convenient and privacy-preserving manner. <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable credentials</a> make this possible, but people are just beginning to understand what VCs are and what they enable. This post will examine the world of verifiable credentials and answer a number of common questions that people have when exploring the space of decentralized identity.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 A Quick Definition of Digital Identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Both NFTs and verifiable credentials have attracted people who are interested in the future of digital identity, so we’re doing a deep dive on the benefits and drawbacks of both technologies.<br><br></p><p>First, a definition for Identity:<br><br></p>  Identity = identifiers + attributes  <p><br>Here’s what this equation has looked like over time:<br><br></p>  Physical example: name (identifier) + hair color, height, occupation (attributes)  Web2 example: username or email (identifier) + profile picture, bio, posts (attributes)  Web3 example: Public cryptocurrency wallet address (identifier) + NFTs and tokens you hold (attributes)  Decentralized identity example: DID address (identifier) + verifiable credentials (attributes)  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 What Are Verifiable Credentials? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Verifiable credentials are data containers for personal information. They are JSONs (Java Script Object Notation) with semantic meaning and structured schema signed by a public-private key pair. <a href="https://twitter.com/RuffTimo">Timothy Ruff</a> has compared them to <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">shipping containers</a>. While shipping containers revolutionized the world, they also don’t seem very revolutionary to the average person. The same thing goes for how our data flows online.<br><br>Verifiable credentials standardize the format of information allowing you to own your data and selectively share it with relevant parties across the internet. Instead of hosting information in siloes that only interact through API integrations, VCs put the power back in your own hands.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Non-Fungible Tokens are unique representations of an asset on a blockchain, like Ethereum or Solana. NFTs can be bought and sold in marketplaces like OpenSea and Magic Eden. Thus far, NFTs have frequently been speculative “assets” used to represent community memberships, profile pictures, art, metaverse land, and more. NFTs are blockchain-specific, so a token that is on the Ethereum blockchain cannot be transferred to the Solana blockchain.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Implications of Verifiable Credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to own your data, making the process of sharing your data easier and more privacy-preserving. For example, sharing verifiable credentials could make the process of applying for an apartment easier. The purpose of checking documentation like bank statements and identity documents is to prove that you are who you say you are, and you can be trusted to pay rent. Currently, you have to show documentation and identification to each individual vendor you’re applying to. Instead, imagine that you held credentials in a digital wallet that could provide assurances about your identity and trustworthiness to pay rent.<br><br>Rather than sharing all of your personal information with each apartment vendor, you could share a cryptographic proof that you can pay rent. Concretely, what would be needed to make this a reality would be a trusted issuer, like a bank, who already has access to your financial history and could issue you a credential verifying that you’re able to pay monthly rent up to a certain amount each month. Now, instead of sharing documentation with the apartment vendor, you can instead share the credential and the apartment vendor can verify its legitimacy. The result is a more privacy-preserving system for sharing personal information.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Implications of Non-Fungible Tokens 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>We’re seeing NFTs used primarily as a form of purchasable membership pass, allowing people special access to channels in a Discord server or to exclusive parties at events like NFT NYC. People also use NFTs as profile pictures and social signals on platforms like Twitter. NFTs could also be used in video games, allowing people to own in-game assets and monetize in new ways. Additionally, there are people selling their digital art as NFTs, giving them access to a worldwide audience of potential collectors.<br><br>NFTs facilitate the seamless buying and selling of digital assets. Because they are closely tied with blockchains, and often associated with speculative value, NFTs are inherently financial. Anyone can make an “offer” on an NFT that you own. You pay fees to buy or even transfer NFTs on most blockchains.</p>

			 Public Wallet Addresses vs. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>NFTs are associated with static, public wallet addresses. So if I were to share my wallet address, you would be able to view every NFT that I own and have ever owned. This is beneficial for displaying your collection but has obvious downsides for privacy. Public wallet addresses are not a great place to store your private data.<br><br>Verifiable credentials are associated with <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>. VCs are not publicly viewable but instead are selectively shared with verifying parties as needed. You can have a VC issued to your wallet without the whole internet knowing. While you can make your DID public, which is very useful if you are issuing and signing credentials as a trusted authority, you can also rotate DIDs as a user interacting with different vendors.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Role of Cryptographic Signatures 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Since NFTs are associated with public addresses, you can easily check if someone’s wallet address holds a certain asset. The importance of cryptographic signatures is to prove that you are the person who is in control of the wallet. For example, if you go to an event and you are only allowed in if you hold a certain NFT, you will have to cryptographically sign a message from the wallet that holds the NFT to prove you’re the real owner.<br><br>When dealing with verifiable credentials, it’s not publicly known which VCs are associated with which DIDs. If you needed to hold a certain credential to enter an event, the vendor would request a cryptographic proof that you hold the required credential. You would then have the option to share the credential with that vendor, and they can check the legitimacy of the proof. Your information would only be shared with the event host and would otherwise remain encrypted and private to you.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 How Blockchain Relates to NFTs and VCs 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>NFTs are minted on specific blockchains, establishing a unique identifying address and a link to the digital asset. When transferred, NFTs must pay ledger fees to move them on their specific blockchain. NFTs are moved from public address to public address in easily trackable transactions. Blockchains are required and used for any minting and transferring of an NFT.<br><br>In comparison, verifiable credentials are issued to digital wallets, where the credentials are stored and can only be accessed by the wallet owner. Verifiable credentials are not tracked by their movement on a blockchain, and you would have no way of knowing another user received a verifiable credential, or if they presented a credential to a third party. Blockchains are not required for exchanging verifiable credentials, but layer-2 networks like Ion, built on top of Bitcoin, can provide an additional level of security when creating DIDs.</p>

				<p>NFTs are great for public and transferrable digital assets. Blockchains allow you to show that a specific wallet address owns a digital item. For example, we know that the owner of <a href="https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/details/5822">Cryptopunk #5822</a> is the Ethereum address 0xe648730be51893acd0045522a0830ec5399ae74c. This is great for showcasing a collection of things like art and membership passes. For this reason, NFTs can help to establish your reputation publicly as a collector, investor, community member, or donor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NFTs also provide a monetization strategy for artists, designers, and community builders, allowing them to tap into a global, decentralized market. The combination of public display and financial speculation has created viral marketing loops, leading to a large interest in NFTs over the past two years.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Biggest Drawbacks of NFTs in Digital Identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>You would not want to represent identifying documents as NFTs. You cannot “prove” claims about yourself such as “I am 21 years old” using an NFT. Even if the US government issued everyone an ID card NFT, you could sell it.</p>
<p><br>Note: It is possible to turn off the “transferability” function in a non-fungible token contract. These assets are often referred to as “Soul Bound Tokens” (SBTs) which means they are forever tied to a specific public wallet address. SBTs have more potential for use in an identity context but risk making private information like your date of birth and address public.</p>
<p>Since NFTs are tied to blockchains, you incur fees when transferring them. Thus, if you were to issue tickets to an event as NFTs, you would have an additional cost of paying fees to send the tickets to every attendee’s address. You’re also tied to the speed of that blockchain to complete the transfer of the ticket.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Key Benefits of VCs in Digital Identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Verifiable credentials are stored privately in a way that doesn’t save any personal information to a public blockchain. You can selectively share information with relying parties without leaking it to the entire internet. VCs do not have to be tied to a blockchain and can be faster and more scalable for implementing in the real world. Thanks to DIDs and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications, it’s possible for VCs to be interoperable across different blockchains and even web2 environments. Lastly, VCs are non-transferrable nor purchasable, so you will not run into the issue of someone selling their government-issued ID.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Biggest Drawbacks of VCs in Digital Identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While privacy and a lack of financial speculation are two huge benefits of using verifiable credentials in digital identity, both factors have limited the social reach and virality of the concept. Search volumes for NFTs are several orders of magnitude higher than for verifiable credentials. When you hear about someone selling an NFT for $10,000 profit, you are likely to look into what’s going on and spend some time understanding the technology.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					Monthly searches for terms realted to NFTs and VCs
										
								 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Verifiable credentials are the more practical technology to digitize our identities and finally allow people to prove who they are on the internet. The challenge of user adoption is on everyone’s mind, and Trinsic is here to make it easy for developers to issue, manage, and verify credentials.

			 The Future of Digital Identity Is in Our Hands 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Both NFTs and VCs provide new approaches to trust digital information. NFTs allow you to publicly prove that you are the unique owner of a digital asset, whereas VCs allow you to privately prove the legitimacy of a claim made over the internet. At their best, both technologies create new avenues for digital coordination that are more humane, efficient, and user-centric.<br><br>The future of digital identity will be determined by builders, developers, designers, community builders, and dreamers.

  <p>As businesses adopt cloud-based services as part of digital transformation programs to enable flexible working, boost productivity, and increase business agility to remain competitive, many IT and security teams are finding it challenging to gain oversight and control over the multitude of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.&nbsp;Join security experts from KuppingerCole and Axonius as they discuss how to address common security challenges around SaaS such as a lack of visibility of applications and internal and external threats. They will also look at managing risk and explain how to go about delivering security that can drive and enable business growth.</p>
<p>Richard Hill, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole, says security starts with an understanding of what IT assets require protection. He will therefore cover the importance of asset inventories, connections to IT applications and services options, compliance, and automation of policy enforcement.&nbsp;Amir Ofek, CEO of Axonius, will explore the key SaaS challenges, the pitfalls of existing approaches to solving them, and how both business value and risk management needs can be addressed in a single comprehensive solution that can also help optimize licensing and spend.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/comprehensive-approach-saas-complexity"></a>

				 <p>By Dr. Chase Cunningham Ph.D&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine a wall with a gate. The gate allows you to monitor and decide who you let inside the wall. It’s somewhat effective at achieving these ends. Some people climb over, some tunnel under, and some fake their way inside with stolen access credentials. Improbably, some allegedly managed to get inside one of these walls hidden in a big wooden horse. It happened in Troy, remember that?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Troy was our first proof of failure of a perimeter-based security model, and it happened in 1184 B.C. We have known for a long time, over a millenia, that this model is doomed to fail. Yet when it came to protecting digital assets, all we did was take a failed physical approach, digitized it, and expected to do better than the Trojans.&nbsp; Wow, were we wrong.</p>
<p>If I labor this point, it’s because the digital walls we have built&nbsp; now have thousands of gates: one for every employee, one for every employee device&nbsp;— maybe even one for every cloud application. Working from home during the global pandemic turned the wall into a sieve, everywhere, all at once, that operates at the speed of light (literally).</p>
<p>The wall has fallen and isn’t coming back. It’s not simply that hybrid work environments blew it up, it’s that the rapid pace of digitalization makes it impossible to rebuild. The expansion, every day, of digital services and e-commerce shows that we, collectively, want the convenience, efficiency, and opportunity of a more digitized life. Businesses require speed and dynamism, users want security and ease of use anywhere at any time, and global connectivity demands that we interoperate and optimize now, not later.</p>
<p>The sooner we realize that we need some “post-wall” thinking about security, the sooner we’ll be able to deal with the exponential growth in attacks on company and organizational infrastructure. If we accept that we are now living in a digitalized society, we need to start by acknowledging some new ground rules:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 People are not going to magically become security experts. You can train your workforce to be cyber aware, but all it takes is one person to click on a malicious link for your company to be phished. Training may reduce the odds, but not to zero. That we see phishing attacks work over and over again demands that we accept human nature as it is and not how we’d like it to be.. 
 

 
 People will seek the most convenient process. We are energy misers. The course of action most likely to be taken will be the one that requires the least amount of effort. So, while various forms of multi-factor authentication may increase security, they also increase cognitive burden and annoyance. We have to make security simple—a part of the architecture.<br>
. 
 Employees are not going to want to submit their personal devices for securitization. Putting security and surveillance software on all the devices your employee is likely to interact with is going to be challenging and likely impossible, for practical, privacy -related, and political reasons. People don’t want their employers to have access to and control of their personal mobile devices.<br>
. 
 We already have physical means of verifying and validating “who” a person is and “what” they are trying to do (ever boarded an aircraft since 9/11?). We should be able to apply that same methodology and metric into today’s digitized systems and not make people suffer through a network-enabled TSA. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What then is the answer</p>
<p>If the wall has been dissolved or, at the very least, rendered useless by a thousand gates, then everything must be verified everywhere continuously because the gates are now everywhere. And the only way to do this easily, effectively, and inexpensively is through using solutions like verifiable credentials coupled with a security technology stack that removes friction while increasing adoption and use.&nbsp; This is applied to the user and doesn’t rely on them to adopt any additional solutions.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials make trust in identity and data portable, because the process of creating a verifiable credential means that the integrity of the transaction and the integrity of any information that transaction contains is guaranteed by a combination of decentralized identifiers, decentralized ledgers, cryptographic signatures, and biometric interfaces with mobile devices. To put it simply, using verifiable credentials means we know the “who” and “what” and are able to validate that there is a reason for an action to occur.&nbsp; We don’t just allow a connection because of a username and password —and we don’t enable default connectivity because a firewall rule says “allow all”.</p>
<p>These technologies allow trust to be triangulated between the issuer of a credential, the entity holding the credential, and the validator verifying the credential. And when the integrity of a verifiable credential is verified, the information associated with it is immediately actionable.</p>
<p>A critical feature of decentralized identity is that it enables the separation of form from content. It’s the form in which digital information is held that makes the&nbsp; information verifiable. This has huge implications: It removes the need to store critical data or personally identifiable information in a centralized database as part of the verification process as the nature of that validation triangulation is distributed from the start. All data is tied to its owner and shared in privacy-preserving ways over uniquely encrypted communications channels.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential replaces a login and password, and verification is instant and device agnostic. There is no “one ring to rule them all” that is the single point of failure in this model. If we take other security technologies and apply them to build out the security posture of the entities tied to that validated and verified credential, the rising tide of a better security position does finally raise all ships.</p>
<p>As the perimeter defenses of a billion digital entities dissolve, we can see online interaction as a much more open environment where information can move much more freely; that’s what the internet is for. It was designed for that very purpose, it was not built to be secure. But with today’s technologies applied in innovative but natural ways, we can operate in a secure and optimized manner. The only way to make this digital reality work is to accept that the old security architecture failed all of us and is never coming back. Thankfully.</p>
<p>The way we get better is to accept that reality and build our future to look the way that the internet was meant to operate. Distributed, diverse, adaptable, dynamic, and integrated with our physical selves.</p>

Our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">NB Orbit Enterprise</a> is a web based platform which includes a cloud wallet, connection management system, verifiable credential issuance &amp; verification tools and more.</p>
<p>By using our products, organizations can deploy digital credentialing ecosystems, become credential issuers, accept digital credentials within workflows and use a variety of digital wallets and agents to connect and exchange credentials.</p>
<p>Today, let us show you how our NB Orbit Enterprise Presentation Proposals function allows an Organizational Holder to send a proposal to a verifier entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows an organization to initiate the workflow rather than waiting on a verifier to send a proof request. We have implemented the orchestration provided by <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a>&nbsp;to enable all this to happen.</p>
 
    
 
<p><br>
We’ve written a blog post about why credential issuance should be holder-driven (<a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">here</a>). We think that the same is true for verifications and other functions.<br>
<br>
The steps are the following:</p>
 
 The Proposal is sent by the Prover (your organization) 
 The Verifier can be automatically sent back a proof request to the Prover (this is configurable) 
 The Prover clicks on Proof Request and selects a credential to provide in the proof presentation. The Prover can add self-attested attributes if they wish. 
 The Verifier then receives the Proof Presentation (in Verification Monitoring if they are using NB Orbit Enterprise)

 Introduction <p>In 2022, a total of $2 billion has been already lost in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space as a result of scams and hacks. Centralized crypto platforms attempt to provide users with security features like account passwords and 2-factor authentication to secure their funds. However, the control of users’ crypto wallets and private keys still remains with the company. </p><p>This is the reason why you are hearing when centralized crypto lending platforms going bankrupt because they are taking users’ funds with them. With a custodial wallet, another party controls your private keys and most custodial wallets these days are web-based exchange wallets.</p><p>This is why we always say in crypto:<br></p><blockquote>“Not your keys, not your crypto.”<br></blockquote><p>This advice refers to two key points:</p><p>1) if you don’t truly own your private keys, you don’t truly own the cryptocurrencies in your wallet</p><p>2) if your private keys are, in any way, compromised, stolen, or in the hands of someone else, your funds are not safe. </p><p>The latest iteration of the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/the-complete-history-of-the-world-wide-web/">World Wide Web, Web3</a> is built on the blockchain with a decentralized infrastructure promising to give its users complete control and ownership of their data with much greater security. Decentralization of data networks or the financial ecosystem also means that the responsibility of the security of users’ data and funds also comes back to the users. <br></p> Types of Crypto Scams<br> <p>Web3 is no longer merely an idea. It is intrinsically linked to ownership of data and financial value. Millions of users are falling victim to the scams in the Web3 and crypto industry and billions of dollars of funds have been lost. This is preventing the penetration of Web3’s adoption into different industrial sectors as the hacking incidents portray a flaw in the technology. &nbsp;</p><p>In this blog, we are going to discuss in detail the types of scams web3 investors fall victim to and how to stay safe against them. Users have suffered due to these scams frequently. You will also find the best practices that you can use to protect yourself from these scams.</p> Phishing Scams <p>Phishing scams are the most common type of scams in the crypto and Web3 space. Scammers only target one thing: your private key and seed phrase because this information gives full access to your funds. Every attempt people make in this type of scam is to get your private keys in any way possible. </p><p>What are these ways? Here are the types of phishing scams that are frequently used to deceive users into submitting their private keys.</p> Seed Phishing Through Ads <p>In a recent incident that happened in Q1 2022, scammers put Google Ads to promote the malicious URLs of their websites that were either claiming themselves to be a wallet or a wallet aggregator service. They made users submit their seed phrase on their website to access their own (different) crypto wallet on their platform. What it turned out to be was a simple form where they were collecting public addresses and seed phrases of users and using that information to draining all the funds which left users’ wallets empty. </p><p>Continuing the same warning, NEVER EVER share your private keys and seed phrases with anyone or on any platform. No legitimate Web3 and cryptocurrency platform will ever ask you for your seed phrase.</p>Google Ad of a fraud website Ice Phishing <p>In the real world, ice fishing is a practice of catching fish where the fisherman needs to create a hole in the middle of a frozen lake or let’s say an opening. A similar opening is created by hackers on the smart contract platforms where they tamper with the user interface. All the hacker needs to do is inject a code that will replace the receiver’s address with the attacker’s address. Being an encrypted randomly generated stream of characters, users don’t double-check before confirming the transaction and click ‘ok’.</p><p>Stay protected:</p><p>There is only one way to defend against this attack: DOUBLE-CHECK each and every character of the sender’s address at least twice, both in the receiver’s address box and the confirmation screen.</p> Social Media Phishing <p>Crypto security firm Certik released a quarterly report in July 2022 in which they noticed a 170% increase in phishing attacks. A striking fact that Certik also mentions in their report is that most phishing attacks are conducted on social platforms like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter. Social media is a huge hunting ground for crypto scammers.</p><p>Scammers will share quotes by famous billionaires or celebrities, slide into your DMs, or share links with exciting rewards to lure users into stealing or acquiring their private information. On Telegram and Twitter, it is easier to do as the security layers groups and projects can implement are very limited. These scammers will either ask you for funds in the promise of higher returns, risk-free profits, secure your wallets, or any other way to either take and run away with your money or get a hold of your private keys.</p>This is how fake accounts share fraudulent links on social media&nbsp;<p>Stay protected:</p>  Never ever share your private keys with them or send a single penny of your funds to them.  Do not click on any suspicious or unknown links.  Keep two-actor authentication (2FA) on all of your social accounts.  Never reply to any messages with suspicious links that you receive on your social accounts.<br>   Employer Phishing <p>Employees of Web3 and Crypto companies are constantly targeted with pretentious and fake emails by scammers who pretend to be seniors or bosses of these employees and ask them to either send funds to them or share their wallet addresses.</p><p>Additionally, scammers target job seekers by either faking themselves as potential employers or promising them jobs with lucrative returns. The scammers ask the job seekers to share their wallet private keys to send bonuses or advance payments for the roles. Do not share anything with them! Again, no legitimate person or organization will ever ask for your private keys or seed phrase.</p><p>Stay protected:</p>  Always check the domain name of the emails and make sure it is an official email address.  Organizations should implement anti-phishing code to help the receivers identify that the email is authentic and sent by the organization.  If you receive any such email, inform your company seniors or official team members right away. &nbsp;<br>   Malicious Airdrops <p>People surfing Crypto Twitter or crypto-based Telegram channel have seen images similar to the ones below, containing promises by global icons like Elon Musk, Joe Bidden, or Bill Gates running giveaways of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.</p><p><br>Clearly, these are fake! Despite Tesla having millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in their reserve, we are pretty sure they are not holding it to run airdrop campaigns for retail investors. Do not fall, a victim to these scams, because its super easy to create such Photoshopped images.<br></p><p>In addition to impersonating celebrities, scammers also create impostor accounts of crypto and Web3 projects, download the images from their official social profiles, and pretend to run airdrops to scam users. </p><p>Before falling for any of these seemingly lucrative offers, make sure to check the URLs and usernames of the channels and confirm on the official channels with the admins. Mostly, the official channels of any project are available either on the footers of the website or on the <a href="https://www.dock.io/community">community pages</a>.</p><p></p> Crypto Rug Pulls <p>Remember the Tom and Jerry cartoons where Tom pulls the blanket under Jerry’s feet and Jerry rolls over and falls on his head. A similar experience is often faced by crypto and NFT investors when they invest their hard-earned money into a new crypto/NFT project and the founders of the project run away with the funds which drop the price of their own token to zero. This type of scam is known as a Crypto rug pull. </p><p>It all starts with scammers attempting to convince the investors that their project is legitimate and holds a bright future. This convincing is done in various ways like by building a spectacularly looking website, adding the names of fake employers and advisors, and presenting a roadmap that demonstrates the project has a sustainable future. Retail investors around the world start investing in these projects, exchanging their tokens for the project’s tokens in IDO and ICO rounds, and trading on exchanges. </p><p>Then the founders play the real game and begin to pull the rug in one of the following ways:</p>  Dump their tokens in the open market and run away with the users’ funds and sold tokens.  Put a smart contract that locks users’ funds and disables them from selling their tokens.  Extract all the liquidity from liquidity pools they started on the decentralized exchanges leaving users with only tokens and no medium to trade them. <br>  <p>Stay protected:</p>  Research every aspect of the project starting with authenticating the team members and their backgrounds  Don’t fall for huge promises of returns or their claims of becoming the next ‘Bitcoin’ or ‘Ethereum’.  Research! Research! Research!<br>  Price of a rug pulled token dropping straight to zero Malware <p>Malware has always posed a threat to crypto and Web3 users since the inception of the industry. All scammers need to find is a way to inject a virus or malware into your computer system or mobile device. We all copy-paste wallet addresses when we send cryptos to a receiver’s address. This is the exact time when these malwares play their mischiefs and replace the addresses from the receiver’s address to the scammer’s address.</p><p>Addresses being a complex string of alphanumeric characters are not often double-checked by investors before sending and investors end up sending their funds to the scammers. <br></p><p>Stay protected:</p>  Enter the receiver’s address by scanning the QR code  Triple-check each and every character of the receiver’s address.  Try sending a smaller amount of funds before making a big transaction and confirming with the receiver.  Keep your devices virus-free with the help of antivirus programs.  Do not click on any suspicious links that you find on the internet or receive in your emails and messages.   Spoofing <p>Spoofing means when something pretends to be something else. Scammers attack via spoofing using URLs, websites, emails, text messages, and IPs. And now with the innovations in technology, add facial and GPS spoofing also to the list. For example, a spoofed URL is a fraudulent link that pretends to be a legitimate URL designed to steal your data. This is called URL spoofing. Scammers attack via spoofing using URLs, websites, emails, text messages, and IPs. And now with the innovations in technology, add facial and GPS spoofing also to the list.</p><p>Scammers will often use the name of a big trusted Web3 organization and send you communications about your activity or promotions. For example, it can be a promotional email from Binance that says you have won $50 for being a valued customer. However, the email will contain malicious links that will send you to a website that looks like Binance. This spoofed Binance page will have a sign-in form that has been created by scammers to collect your username and password. </p><p>This is just one example of numerous ways how a user can be tricked into believing the legitimacy of online communication or platform. Look at the example below where the scammer has sent an email that looks like it has been sent by MetaMask’s support team. But, if you look at the email address, the reality is different.</p>Email from a fake website impersonating as MetaMask<p>Stay protected:</p>  Always check the URLs, email addresses, and any link that you are accessing. Once you know you are really on the authentic website, bookmark it to reduce your chances of clicking on a scam site that can appear on Google.  Crypto and Web3 projects will never ask you for your seed phrases. Never share them with anyone.  Do not click on any suspicious links that you receive on any communications.  Straightly mark all such emails as spam as it will help other investors also  Never connect your wallet to an unknown platform  <p>In contrast to custodial wallets that are common to centralized crypto exchanges, there are platforms that offer non-custodial wallets where the entire responsibility for the security and safety of users’ funds is with the users. With a non-custodial wallet, you have complete and sole control of your private keys which means you fully control your cryptocurrency and prove the funds are yours.</p> Other Ways to Get ‘REKT’ <p>We have discussed all the major scams that are burning the pockets of Web3 investors. Adding to the ones discussed above, there are a few other ways that can leave Web3 users REKT!</p>  Scammers might blackmail you that they possess personal information, chat history, images, or videos about you and ask for funds.  They might send ransomware to your devices, encrypt all the files on your device, and demand a hefty fee in Bitcoin to decrypt the files.  They organize pumps and dumps on low trading volume altcoins on centralized crypto trading platforms.  They can build Ponzi schemes where at first, they will offer you magnificent returns on your investments, and later, they will run away once they convince you to deposit a large sum for higher returns.  The scammers may act as a romantic partner or someone dealing with life-threatening diseases to lure you to pay them money.<br>   Conclusion <p>Web3 is full of many creative ways to scam users and snatch their private keys and seed phrase to get access to their funds and private information.</p><p>Despite all the variety of scams, there are really only a handful of things you need to keep yourself as safe as possible:<br></p>  Always triple check the sender’s and receiver’s address as scammers will change the address so the assets will go to their address instead  Don’t click on anysuspicious or unknown links, buttons, and ads  Never share your private information, private key, and seed phrase  Always check website URLs, email addresses, and redirects closely  Never send any money to an unknown person or a company  Always keep strong passwords and two-factor authentication on all your accounts  Research every corner of a project before investing your money in it.  <p>If you can learn to implement all the above-mentioned points every time when you interact on a Web3, DeFi, or a crypto platform, your funds will be safe and secure. Your keys and your private information are only yours to keep. While Web3 promises to bring complete ownership of your data, it will be solely your responsibility to keep it secure. </p><p>Stay Safe!</p>

<p>Here at 1Kosmos, It’s been an action-packed September full of events, <a>analyst mentions</a>, <a>awards</a> and more. One of these exciting events was an Innovation Festival in the Philippines hosted by our customer, UnionDigital. The three day festival event with the theme “The Future of Banking is with U” showcases digital innovations of Union Bank and its subsidiaries in both the government and the private sectors. Union Bank hosted the event exhibiting along with its official partners. 1Kosmos, being one of the official partners, was invited to the event to hold workshops with key stakeholders and participate in the fireside chat titled, “Is identity proofing the key to financial crime prevention?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the moment the team arrived in the Philippines, we were amazed by the hospitality of the UnionDigital team. Even though it was the first day of the event and the UnionDigital team had just moved into their new HQ, the dynamic and visionary CEO of UnionDigital, Arvie de Vera, came to meet with us during one of the workshops and to ensure that we were doing well. Our experience was very similar across the board with other folks at the event and outside. We are thankful to the entire UnionDigital and Aboitiz group for their warm welcome during our stay in the Philippines!</p>
<p>As the event took place over the next several days, our team quickly gained valuable insights. First, it was clear that everyone has a very progressive mindset. They are eager to adopt new technologies to stay ahead of the market. As a progressive digital identity company, our team was pleased to connect with these like minded individuals.</p>

<p>One of Union Bank’s progressive offerings is their digital initiative which offers Banking as a Service. Through their partnership with 1Kosmos, digital identity is set to become a key security component driving this initiative. In fact, through various panel discussions, it was evident that Digital Identity has become a focal point that will play a crucial role in mitigating fraud, increasing efficiency and offering a better user experience. Improved digital identity capabilities will also help UnionDigital move toward Zero Trust while reducing the risk of cybercrimes such as ransomware.</p>
<p>The Philippines is amongst the fastest growing economies and is slated to become a trillion dollar economy by the end of this decade. With UnionDigital and Aboitiz group looking to capitalize on this growth opportunity, they seem to be committed to continue making significant investments in its digital infrastructure. And we, at 1Kosmos, are very excited to be part of the journey as a trusted partner.</p>

<p>This article was contributed by Rory O’Neill, Executive at strategic communications consultancy Wachsman.</p><p>The crypto market downturn has taken the world of Web3 by storm over the past three months. Subsequently, this has placed blockchain technology under the microscope of the media, leading to journalists and crypto sceptics alike flocking to provide varying opinions on what the future of the space might&nbsp;hold.</p><p>However, in the hangover of all of this hysteria, there is one issue which has perhaps been largely overlooked, and that is the need for strategic brand management by companies in this field, to effectively weather this crypto winter storm — however lasting it might prove to&nbsp;be.</p><p>In recent weeks, the crypto news cycle has been dominated by negative headlines and navigating this media landscape is no mean feat for firms deeply rooted in Web3 technology. While it might be tempting for brands to retreat into hibernation, it is almost certainly not the right time for those who intend to be in this industry for the foreseeable future to adopt a policy of radio&nbsp;silence.</p><p>Rather, in the throes of this tumult, it is important that blockchain brands act as the standard-bearers for their industry and demonstrate that there is infinitely more to Web3 and blockchain technology than many of these sensationalist headlines might suggest. Accordingly, this makes it the opportune time for companies in this space to keep the drum beating, even in the face of adversity. It’s a time for building, and direct attention should now be placed on the underlying value of Web3 technology.</p><p>We are at a juncture where it is crucial for brands to place a renewed emphasis on education, building and development, and spell out their long-term aspirations, not only for their in-house projects, but also for the industry as a whole. Only this will ensure that brands are well-positioned to enjoy the fruits of the future that lie ahead, in spite of the current downturn.</p><p>An abundance of media coverage is now — understandably — placing a significant emphasis on market conditions. However, against this backdrop, there exists fertile ground for thought-leaders to be a positive force, lean into their expertise, and provide direction to others in the sector on the business-critical decisions that must be made in the current market to enable them to weather this storm and poise themselves for success ahead of the next bull market. Not only does this type of commentary help cut through the noise that we are seeing in the headlines in the short-term, but it can serve to establish spokespeople as go-to sources for valuable analysis in this area, all while refocusing the narrative on the important mission of building towards&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Beyond this, with blockchain technology continuing to become ever more a part of our vernacular, and with big name brands continuing to delve further into the world of Web3, there also exists significant scope to educate those who are new to the industry. At this difficult time, it is imperative to show newcomers and the crypto curious the positive improvements that this budding industry can provide to existing Web2 infrastructures. While authenticity is key, showcasing the exciting projects that continue to make the blockchain space appealing is a great way to avoid going quiet while also making a meaningful contribution to the conversation.</p><p>Further to this point, it is essential that brands use this market downturn as a time to grow and develop, and insulate themselves against the fallout of these types of market fluctuations in the future. What has allowed Web3 to reach previously lofty highs is not pure hype, but rather the strong fundamentals of the underlying technology. It is important to not lose sight of this. Now is the time to focus on these fundamentals and develop technology offerings that can add real value for the companies and consumers who will use them. New product offerings and use cases continue to make headlines, and they provide a tangible positive lifeline for an industry that has an appetite greater than ever for good&nbsp;news.</p><p>By continuing to focus on development while promoting use cases, brands can simultaneously highlight that the positive impacts offered by Web3 technology stretch far beyond short-term fluctuations in the market. Doing so can provide a timely reminder that this winter is something seasonal, not only for individual brands but for the industry as a whole; proof of the lasting value of this technology is found in the fact that it continues to survive the whims of the market. This is perhaps one of the most valuable lessons to be learned from the current crypto climate, and accordingly, it will prove integral to the success of brands in this space from here on outwards.</p><p>Brand management is unquestionably an area that will prove increasingly important as we manoeuvre our way out of this difficult chapter in Web3’s history. Amidst a flurry of media attention, having a strategic approach to navigating this tricky period is paramount to ensuring success. If implemented correctly, not only will a successful branding project facilitate the avoidance of negative coverage, but it could in fact amplify a brand’s awareness while doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>Ultimately, now is not the time to retreat to the shadows, but rather, to rise to the occasion and act as a light at the end of the tunnel for&nbsp;Web3!</p><p>— -</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-08-add-value-not-noise-navigating-web3-branding-in-a-market-downturn-d0f4f376a8b7">OWN Insights 08: Add Value, Not Noise: Navigating Web3 Branding in a Market Downturn</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Secondo una recente ricerca IPSOS, “Violazione dell’identità digitale, comportamenti adottati e rischi percepiti”, quasi un terzo degli italiani ha subito una violazione della propria identità digitale e il 71% prenderebbe in considerazione strumenti di protezione assicurativa per far fronte a tali rischi.</p>



<p>Si pensi solo a quanto oggi siano diffusi strumenti come l’autenticazione biometrica o tramite username e password per l’accesso a conti bancari, agli account di pagamento e ai profili social e quanto queste “chiavi di accesso” siano poco tutelate.</p>



<p>Si inserisce in questo contesto <a href="https://www.wallife.it/it/wallet">Wallife® Biometrics ID</a> un innovativo prodotto assicurativo in grado di proteggere i dati sensibili legati alla vita online dell’individuo assicurando l’identità biometrica digitale, prevenendo il rischio e mitigando il danno.</p>



<p>La soluzione è stata realizzata da Wallife, la prima Insurtech al mondo in grado di fornire risposte sulla sicurezza e sulla protezione degli individui da rischi derivanti dall’utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie, e presentata in una conferenza stampa a cui ha preso parte anche InfoCert con Pasquale Chiaro – Head of Marketing.</p>



 Come ridurre i rischi provenienti dal mondo Cyber e vivere con fiducia il mondo digitale. 



<p>InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea e gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale in ambito SPID è stata tra i primi a credere nel nuovo progetto di Wallife.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Il cyberspace si è rapidamente affermato come una dimensione fondamentale e imprescindibile del nostro quotidiano. Purtroppo, questa rapida diffusione non è stata sempre accompagnata da un’adeguata educazione degli utenti. Il prodotto ideato da Wallife consente di colmare questo gap, permettendo di prevenire alcuni dei rischi propri del mondo cyber e, soprattutto, di mitigarne i danni. Siamo convinti che la partnership con Wallife contribuirà al nostro impegno quotidiano: lo sviluppo e l’offerta di servizi e soluzioni che consentano a imprese, professionisti e cittadini di vivere con fiducia sempre maggiore l’esperienza d’uso della propria identità digitale e il ruolo di attori della digital economy. Questa partnership conferma l’impegno di InfoCert a fianco delle startup più visionarie e innovative per l’accelerazione della trasformazione digitale del nostro Paese.” Carmine Auletta – InfoCert CISO.</p>

				 <p>Sam Curren, Deputy CTO of Indicio discusses recent work by the Decentralized Identity Foundation to make Decentralized Ecosystem Governance an open standard for verifiable credential ecosystems. Decentralized Ecosystem Governance makes governance machine-readable through treating a trust registry as a file as opposed to a service.&nbsp;</p>

 QUESTIONS! 
<p>The question period began at around<a href="https://youtu.be/JSY66-wtZoY?t=2014"> 33 minutes</a>. We had some great questions sent in, including:</p>
 
 Trust Registries will prove essential, but going one layer deeper, the next question is who will be trusted to create, maintain, and validate entrants to the registry. A consortium? In some cases, a regulatory or governmental body? The trust chain is difficult to seed. 
 Do you see a model like a stock market for trust registries? One can buy stocks privately, but to trust that you are getting the correct information and buying legitimate stocks, you would go to one of several stock markets (with their own governance details while also under regulation). There could exist markets of registries that are overseen by regulation (and you could still have private registries) 
 It doesn’t end with a Trust Registry. How do trust registries verify you are the owner of credentials 
 
<p>Participant shared: At the end of the presentation, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-m-ubani/">Marcus Ubani</a> shared that he created an open-source platform as a learning path for himself and newbies to DID/SSI. The platform aims to provide easy access and an overview of all the projects. <a href="https://ssi-did-directory.gitbook.io/open-directory-for-all/">The Open SSI / DID Directory</a>.</p>
 Get Involved! 
<p>Now that we’re starting work on v2 of the Trust Registry Protocol Specification at the ToIP Foundation, we’re excited to open a dialogue on Trust Registries. We want to get people thinking about how Trust Registries will help answer tough questions within an ecosystem to create a whole experience.</p>

<p>The “Ultimate guide to credit cards” advisory service&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cardrates.com/news/sudo-by-anonyome-labs-enables-secure-digital-identities-and-transactions/">CardRates.com</a>&nbsp;recently spoke to Anonyome Labs’ Director of Marketing, Rich Sordahl, and Fintech Operations Manager, Dave Glass, to review&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;for CardRates’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cardrates.com/about/">15 million + users</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skip straight to the review:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cardrates.com/news/sudo-by-anonyome-labs-enables-secure-digital-identities-and-transactions/">Sudo by Anonyome Labs: Enabling Secure Digital Tools That Protect Identities and Transactions</a></p>



<p>CardRates, which reports the latest news, studies and current events from inside the credit card industry, broke down exactly what our privacy tools for both enterprise customers and everyday consumers do, and why they are essential for protecting identities and transactions online.&nbsp;</p>



 Here are seven great things CardRates.com told its 15 Million+ readers about Sudo Platform and MySudo:&nbsp; 



  “Anonyome Labs has built a simple but effective solution through its Sudo Platform — a set of tools that protect online activity through customizable virtual identities known as Sudos. Anonyome works with large enterprises interested in providing privacy protection to end users, and it offers the MySudo app directly to consumers.”<br>  “It’s not too much to say that a privacy crisis threatens the ability of the internet to facilitate modern conveniences without destroying consumer privacy. Credit bureaus, insurance agencies, personal privacy protection companies, and other enterprise-level clients use Anonyome’s Sudo Platform to foster a more protective internet.”<br>  “Sudos are at the heart of the platform. Many consumers typically keep separate work and personal profiles online. Sudos provide a platform that enables individuals to create up to nine virtual identities for different aspects of their online lives.”<br>  “Companies determine how they deploy that functionality based on their use cases. Through Sudos, end users deploy virtual email addresses and phone numbers for voice calling and texting. The platform also houses a host of other privacy protections — all easy to integrate into existing corporate infrastructure via preconstructed user interface modules, sample apps, and software development kits (SDKs).”<br>  “The Sudo Platform keeps communications private with tools that include encrypted messaging, voice, video, and email. Private browsing, ad blocking, and site reputation services protect end users from online threats. And the ability to create virtual credit and debit cards enables users to shop securely by creating a different card for every purpose.”<br>  “Signup [to virtual cards] through the app or one of Anonyome’s partners requires a comprehensive KYC (know your customer) identity check that Anonyome’s services perform. After they’re validated, users connect a debit or credit card to make transactions. ACH based funding via bank account is coming soon. Creating and changing Sudos for shopping, browsing, social media, or anything else is simple.”<br>  “There’s no turning back from the efficiencies and conveniences of digital life. But every click and tap has the potential to become part of a bank’s or merchant’s revenue model. Sudos give consumers a simple way to control how they present themselves online.”

		 NB Orbit Enterprise Platform used in Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) initiative to enhance Sustainability Reporting between multiple stakeholders. 
<p>As leaders in climate change legislation, the Government of British Columbia (B.C.) is helping to deploy cutting-edge technologies to complement them in their journey towards a low-carbon economy. In an effort to improve trust, accuracy, and efficiency when sharing sustainability data, <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">Energy and Mines Digital Trust (EMDT)</a> was established to incentivize the formation of a digital trust ecosystem.</p>
<p>Northern Block partnered with EMDT and provided our no-code <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">NB Orbit Enterprise Platform</a> to support two pilot projects aimed at better managing sustainable mining practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporting environmental impact data can be a complicated and laborious process. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data.</p>
<p>This project demonstrated an improved method for exchanging data, by allowing participants to share and receive digital credentials, including Verifiable GHG Emissions data related to specific mining sites and natural gas facilities.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, we accomplished some nice feats:</p>
<p>(1) Successfully demonstrated Interoperability between NB Orbit Enterprise and BC Traction in the exchange of Carbon Emissions Credentials.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image taken from EMDT Case Study (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">here</a>)</p>
<p>(2) Successfully piloted the Presentation Proposal function (Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0), so mining companies (Holders) are capable of initiating holder-driven proof requests with Verifiers such as the Climate Action Secretariat, whom they owe sustainability reporting to.</p>
  
<p><br>
Northern Block is committed to driving digital transformation by supporting the implementation of digital trust solutions which lead to value creation for entire ecosystems. Our mission is to build impactful solutions to achieve self-sovereignty, and we are proud to be actively contributing to these goals in collaboration with the Government of British Columbia, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Copper Mountain Mining Corporation and many others.</p>

A lot of my work has been based around understanding who the user is, who the customer is, and enabling them to have a safer online experience. That’s why GlobaliD really resonated with me because I could help build a future where our online identity is privacy preserving by default. The company seemed to be one of the organizations in the industry that was ahead of the curve in that&nbsp;regard.</p><p>I was also looking to have a larger impact with my role and truly get in the trenches with my team. Since GlobaliD is a startup and still relatively small I thought I would have a great opportunity to do&nbsp;that.</p> Before joining the GlobaliD&nbsp;team <p>I graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor’s degree in social computing information systems. After finishing college I got a job in California at Cisco Systems where I started out as a front end developer. Eventually I moved into a product management role where I gained an interest in cyber security. I also received my Master’s degree in software engineering while attending a part-time program at San Jose State University. The majority of my identity access management experience comes from my time at Duo Security where I managed the core authentication product.</p> How GlobaliD can help&nbsp;users <p>The best way to think about how people can utilize GlobaliD is in situations where you have an option to sign in to a website with a third-party like Apple or Google. You can also sign in with GlobaliD which is a more privacy preserving way to access your&nbsp;account.</p><p>When you utilize a sign-in option from Apple or Google, you’re supporting their business model which is based on harvesting your data in order to try and better understand your online behavior.</p><p>GlobaliD has a really different approach and it’s primarily ethos driven. We want to give users control over what data they share. That is the methodology and the ethos behind the company. Our hope is that by bringing a privacy preserving solution to the market we can offer end users a different option compared to what exists today where they’re trading privacy for convenience.</p> How GlobaliD can help businesses <p>One of the biggest problems that businesses have is ensuring that people who are trying to interact with them online are who they claim to be. They’re constantly trying to make sure that people aren’t committing fraud or acting maliciously.</p><p>GlobaliD’s identity platform enables companies to offer secure onboarding and authentication via a passwordless, mobile app based process. For example, we have customers who require that their users verify a photo ID document as part of their onboarding process. They can add GlobaliD as an option to their login and configure a KYC (know your customer) check in our admin panel without having to handle any of the integration themselves.</p><p>That’s where we can add a lot of value because businesses just want to know that a customer went through a reliable KYC process. They don’t want to store images of all their customer’s driver’s licenses. They don’t want to store any PII (personal identifying information). GlobaliD allows businesses to not have to deal with that issue which in turn helps them manage&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If they don’t have PII data about their users then when the inevitable happens and they have a data breach or get hacked, bad actors can’t access anything.</p> Why he’s looking forward to verifiable credentials <p>GlobaliD is building support into our platform for a new W3C technology called verifiable credentials. This is really exciting because if we get this right, we have the opportunity to solve the online identity problem in a different way than what is offered today. Current solutions like liveliness checks, SMS verification, email verification, and even physical document verification all have multiple points of failure, and the most determined bad actors can spoof&nbsp;them.</p><p>In contrast, verifiable credentials will enable a business to independently trust another organization who makes a claim about a GlobaliD user, and then issues that user a verifiable credential. This will give businesses a higher degree of certainty the user is who they claim to be while making the verification process easier for the individual.</p><p>An example where you might see this play out in real life is in the fast growing market of decentralized finance (DeFi). By nature, DeFi only requires a crypto wallet to access funds and transact on the internet. However, we still want to make sure these funds aren’t being laundered or used nefariously, so we have to bridge that gap between decentralization and security.</p><p>We can do this by having other centralized crypto exchanges who require users to go through a KYC process, like Coinbase or FTX, issue a verifiable credential to your GlobaliD. This enables smaller DeFi projects to be regulatory compliant while not requiring the user to repeat the same process over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>While we still have a long way to go to achieve this vision, these identity building blocks are beginning to stack on top of each other. It’s really exciting to be a part of and I believe it’s what’s going to get us to the future we’re trying to&nbsp;build.</p> The benefits of a remote work lifestyle <p>We’re so fortunate to be working in technology and be given the ability to work remotely. One of the biggest positives is how my work and personal life have managed to meld together in a really flexible way. I’m very thankful for our leadership who prioritize our mental health and well being. They do a great job of making sure we’re not burnt out and allow us to step away and take care of ourselves when we need to. That allows me to bring my best self to work everyday.</p><p>It also makes it really exciting when we get to meet up and see each other in-person. When I first started I was able to attend the RSA Security Conference with Kevin Boehm (CEO) and Todd Collins (Head of Design). I also got to meet Trey Steinhoff (Product Marketing Manager) when he traveled to San Francisco for a company meeting. When you don’t see these people everyday and then you get the opportunity to meet them in-person it makes you really appreciate the interactions you’re able to have. You can figure out what their passions are both at work and outside of the company and it helps you build camaraderie with everyone.</p> On his hobbies and interests <p>Right now I’m learning how to play the piano. I’m taking lessons remotely every Wednesday. I also have a personal goal to get better at surfing throughout the rest of the year. I live in San Francisco which is next to the ocean, so I feel like I should take advantage of that and improve while I can. Those are the things I’m doing in my free time when I’m not focusing on identity standards.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, sign up for the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter.</a> You’ll get monthly updates on digital identity, company news and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Also, ICYMI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-stefanie-van-dyk-3af2016568e1">Meet the Team — Stefanie van Dyk, People Operations Manager</a>  <a>Meet the Team- Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care&nbsp;Manager</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Erik Westra, Head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-nikhil-khare-a75fbaa3bbaa">Meet the Team: Nikhil Khare, Product Manager</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>Understanding the Ethereum Virtual Machine and&nbsp;Solidity</blockquote> Ethereum virtual&nbsp;machine <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. EVM is sandboxed and has the characteristic of running completely isolated from other environments. Thanks to this, the code running in the EVM cannot be accessed by other processes, nor can it be accessed by an unspecified network.</p><a href="https://ethereum.org">https://ethereum.org</a> Ethereum structure reorganization<p>The role of EVM can be broadly divided into two categories: Calculation and data&nbsp;storage.</p> Calculation <p>To avoid consensus problems, EVM keeps instruction sets to a minimum. Basic algebraic, bitwise, logical, and comparison operations are supported, as well as conditional and unconditional jumps. In addition, EVM supports commands for accessing information such as block number and timestamp so that the information of the blockchain can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>With the hard fork, the cost of each operation may be changed, and new operations may be added and&nbsp;deleted.</p> Data Storage <p>EVM’s data storage space is generally divided into three types: storage, memory, and stack. From the perspective of Ethereum as a whole, it can include Calldata or even block-level areas.</p><p>Storage is an area that permanently preserves data and is a key-value store that accesses 256 bits of value from 256 bits of the key. Because I/O uses a lot of hardware and time, storage-related instructions are relatively expensive and consume more gas. Because it is expensive, minimizing storage usage is the key to smart contract development. Also, storage in the EVM requires explicit permissions for read/write. Stored values that are not set to the public and set to internal or private cannot be accessed by other contracts. Instead, it can be accessed through functions with getter and setter roles, with visibility set to public or external functions.</p><p>Memory is a temporary space used by the contract, newly secured for each message call. It increases linearly, of course, the more it scales, the more expensive it becomes. Currently, since the cost increases to the quadratic level, it is necessary to consider a memory-saving technique in contract development.</p><p>For reference, the message call also has another storage area called Calldata, and it is possible to prevent a considerable cost due to the increase in memory by using it as it is without copying it to the memory. However, the memory area can be modified, but Calldata can only be&nbsp;read.</p><p>The stack is an area that handles input and output values for operations. EVM is not a computer hardware-like register machine but a stack machine with a simple structure. Therefore, all operations are performed on the stack. Since the maximum stack size is limited to 1024, be aware of this and use local variables or parameters appropriately.</p><p>The Log can also store data at the block level. The defined event can be stored by emitting it. However, the contract cannot access the same Log after the Log is created. Instead, it is an efficient area to access outside the blockchain. Since these log data are also recorded through the bloom filter, the Log can be found even by light clients that do not have full blockchain data in a cryptographically secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>In addition, there is a virtual ROM area for uploading codes to prevent forgery/falsification during code execution, and an area for storing block information and information of the blockchain itself.</p> Solidity <p>Solidity is a high-level object-oriented language for implementing smart contracts targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any programming is possible by paying the fees within the block gas&nbsp;limit.</p><p>Solidity was greatly influenced by several existing programming languages, especially in the early days, and was designed with much influence from JavaScript. Its effectiveness can be seen in a curly-bracket language and import methods. Even in the early days, it was very similar, such as function-level scoping and the var keyword, but now it is no longer supported for security reasons. Instead, it can be said that version 0.4 is closer to C/C++, such as variable declarations, looping statements, and overloading. Convenience and safety have been improved through subsequent major version updates, and it currently has its own unique style, such as strict type conversion. It was also influenced by Python, such as decorators (called modifiers in Solidity), multiple inheritances, the super keyword, and copy semantics of value and reference types.</p> Contract development languages <p>In addition to Solidity, EVM bytecode can be written in various languages. Vyper is a Python-like contract language. Yul/Yul+ is an intermediate language, and low-level language is used when optimization and security are essential. It is mainly used to implement EVM and common denominator work with Ewasm and optimistic rollup. FE is being developed as an easy-to-learn, easy-to-learn, developer-friendly language inspired by Python and&nbsp;Rust.</p><p>Although various languages exist, contract development through Solidity is the most active, for the following reasons:</p>  Numerous tutorials and sample open source&nbsp;code  A variety of tools to improve development and ease of&nbsp;use  Large development community  Inline assembly can be used when low-level development is required while providing reasonable functionality   Solidity Inline&nbsp;Assembly <p>Solidity’s inline assembly is a feature that facilitates low-level development beyond the functionality of Solidity. Although it is an assembly, it is easy to develop by providing a functional style.</p><p>Example of low-level code:</p> 3 0x80 mload add 0x80 store <p>Coded as&nbsp;follows:</p> mstore(0x80, add(mload(0x80), 3)) <p>It has the same meaning, but convenience is increased thanks to the functional style, readability, and development.</p><p>Inline assemblies allow direct optimization of code to be written, but conversely, they may not benefit from optimization performed by the compiler. Therefore, it is efficient to write inline assembly only when it is determined that it can be clearly optimized and leave the rest to the compiler.</p> EVM Compatible Blockchain Source: <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth/">https://ethereum.org/en/eth/</a><p>Most of the projects that forked Ethereum also use EVM as it is or provide compatibility. That makes it possible to develop contracts using Solidity and a natural connection to many existing tools and services, such as REMIX, a web IDE that supports debugging, convenient contract deployment and execution, and multiple extensions.</p><p>However, since Ethereum’s EVM command update and Solidity version upgrade are being made steadily, it can be said that it is a healthy project to reflect the upgrade even after the chain fork continuously.</p> Metadium <p>For example, in the case of Metadium, the contents of the Istanbul hard fork of Ethereum are applied based on the master branch and the latest release version as of September 2022.</p><p>Istanbul is a hard fork with changes at the EVM level, including the addition of CHAINID and EXTCODEHASH opcodes. The code can be verified that these two opcodes are added to Metadium.</p>Two block-related opcodes have been added to the Istanbul Hard&nbsp;Fork.<p>In Istanbul, the gas cost of existing opcodes has also changed several times. For example, the gas cost of SLOAD has been changed from 200 to 800, and related codes can be found in Metadium.</p>Code reflecting changes in the gas ratio of opcodes related to the tri-size.<p>Even after Istanbul, there were many significant and minor changes to Ethereum, and their reflections could be found in the Metadium development branch.

  <p>Organisationen, die die Digitalisierung ihrer Businessprozesse versäumen, werden es in naher Zukunft schwer haben, wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben. Mit zunehmender Digitalisierung steigen aber auch die Cyberrisiken, weil die Verlagerung von Dienstleistungen in die Cloud und die zunehmende Unterstützung von mobilem und dezentralem Arbeiten die Bedrohungsflächen rapide vergrößert. IT-Sicherheitsteams haben nicht zuletzt wegen geringer Budgets und mangelndem Know-How Mühe, Bedrohungen zu erkennen, darauf zu reagieren und sie einzudämmen, zumal diese zunehmend von staatlicher Seite ausgehen und mit Lieferketten zusammenhängen.</p>
<p>Sicherheitsexperten von KuppingerCole Analysts und Sophos erörtern die neuesten Entwicklungen in der Bedrohungslandschaft und erläutern, warum interne Sicherheitsteams in der Lage sein müssen, ihre Fähigkeiten zur Erkennung, Analyse, Behebung und Wiederherstellung von Cyberangriffen zu erweitern und zu verbessern, um Sicherheit und Compliance zu gewährleisten. Hierzu bieten sich Lösungen im Bereich Managed Detection and Response (MDR) an.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst bei KuppingerCole, wird die wichtigsten Herausforderungen der heutigen Cybersicherheit skizzieren, die neuesten Überlegungen zur Cyberverteidigung erörtern, die Bedrohungen hinter einigen aktuellen Cyberangriffen untersuchen. Zudem wird er die Notwendigkeit einer Rund-um-die-Uhr-Überwachung, effektiver Erkennungsmechanismen, schneller Reaktionszeiten und proaktiver Verteidigungsfähigkeiten erläutern.</p>
<p>Michael Veit, Technology Evangelist bei Sophos, wird die Vorteile von MDR für Unternehmen aller Größenordnungen erläutern, darunter den Wert von Threat Hunting, die Bestimmung des Umfangs und Schweregrads von Bedrohungen, die Anwendung von Geschäftskontext, die Neutralisierung von Bedrohungen und die Beseitigung der Ursachen von Vorfällen. Darüber hinaus gibt er Einblicke in die Sophos Angebote Managed Threat Response und Rapid Response.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity-teams-mit-mdr-staerken"></a>

<p>So far, in the GlobaliD 101 series we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-id-wallets-68fa77e6d0d7">Part 3:</a> Why the ID Wallet is the first step toward achieving a new vision for digital&nbsp;identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-every-company-is-an-identity-company-a851beed999d">Part 4</a>: Why every company is an identity&nbsp;company  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-bring-your-own-identity-5b9927008190">Part 5</a>: What is Bring Your Own Identity?  <p>Today, we’ll discuss a key topic that’s core to the future of digital identity — reusable identity.</p><p>Your driver’s license is a form of reusable identity. You receive one after you’ve verified yourself at the DMV with required identifying documents. (And, of course, after you’ve passed your road&nbsp;test.)</p><p>You can now present your driver’s license whenever some form of identity verification is required. The same goes for your passport.</p><p>That’s not how identity typically works online. Instead, you need to re-verify yourself with each new service. Imagine having to go back to the DMV every time you needed to prove that you’re legally allowed to&nbsp;drive.</p><p>Having to redundantly verify your identity online is also incredibly insecure. Every time you do so, your sensitive personal information is stored on yet another server on the internet. Security practices across businesses will vary. The point here is that each server is another potential target for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>It’s also bad for business. Not only are there costs associated with managing user data, the need to verify identity every time you onboard a customer increases friction by an order of magnitude.</p><p>While some forms of reusable identity already exist, they are more often than not associated with your social media accounts — for instance, Google or Facebook. With one account, you can sign up and connect to a large network of services. Known as Bring Your Own Identity, we discuss that framework in our previous piece in the series. The problem here is that these forms of identity don’t have the same level of trust necessary for more important tasks, say, opening a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>In an ideal world, we would be able to reuse our identity just as we reuse our driver’s license. With an identity that you own, you could verify your driver’s license once and receive a credential for doing so. You should now be able to reuse that credential without going through the same verification process wherever a driver’s license is required.</p><p>Businesses love this form of identity because it reduces the hurdles customers need to jump over to use their service, expanding their pool of potential users. With a reusable credential that they can trust, they can have the peace of mind of knowing who their customers claim to be without needing to deal with all of that expensive management of sensitive data.</p><p>Bottom line, we all need an easier way to prove who we are online. Reusable identity is the next step towards that solution. In fact, the market for reusable digital identity applications is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/reusable-digital-identity-applications-to-reach-266b-by-2027-liminal-report">projected to reach $266B by&nbsp;2027.</a></p><p>With the technology continuing to improve and governments continuing to adopt electronic identity systems, reusable identity is set to play a big part in making our digital lives&nbsp;easier.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about <a href="https://www.global.id/">GlobaliD</a>, visit <a href="https://www.global.id/">our website</a>, contact our sales team or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-reusable-identity-9dc6a1860e8">GlobaliD 101: Reusable Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>If you look at the internet just 15 years ago, the concept of trust only went one way. It was all about organizations on the internet needing to trust the end user. They needed to make sure the end user was who they were claiming to be; after all there was the famous New Yorker cartoon that stated, "On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog." This spoke to the anonymity that the internet provided in those days. That led to the mentality that strong security was of the utmost importance — to mitigate risks and assure data integrity to protect themselves from bad actors — with little concern for the customer's experience or data.</p>

<p>In an effort to be sure of whom companies were doing business with, they could put in a lot of steps and collect a lot of data from end users to assure they had the right person. And it didn't really matter. It didn't matter because the use of the internet wasn't as pervasive as it is today — it was almost more of a privilege for the tech savvy. Customers didn't have choices, there weren't a lot of businesses on the internet, and people had no idea just how valuable their data was.</p>

<p>Everything has changed. The rise of Google and Facebook showed people just how valuable their data was, while exposing the common practice of many companies to share or sell data to other organizations. With this information out in the news, coupled with regulations like GDPR to protect PII, people have become much more protective of their data. Now, the pendulum has swung and the internet trust model has become much more circular, with customers very concerned about privacy and about ensuring that their data is only used for the actions they consent to. In today's internet, if organizations want to collect data from their end users, they have to make their customers feel that they can be trusted with the data, showing themselves to be good stewards of their customers' data.</p>

<p>To build that trust with end users, organizations need to give them the tools and the proper choices to feel that the organization can be trusted. Tools that allow users to give consent for their data to be collected and used appropriately, for example, or to opt into a marketing campaign. Most importantly, users must have the ability to easily review and change those settings. Furthermore, as organizations leverage social media for user registration, it is important to give users choices. Some might feel more comfortable using one form of social media vs. another. Some companies are even exploring what social media providers actually reduce the initial perception of trust simply by offering them as a choice.</p>

<p>At ForgeRock, we help our customers grow and retain their user base by providing the tools that allow their users to easily manage their data. Through the use of our Intelligent Access Orchestration engine, users can easily opt in and out of marketing choices and give consent during the initial registration. Once an account has been created, we offer a dashboard where users can go and see how their data is being used and easily make changes to their settings. These changes are immediately acted on by setting off events to remove a user's data from platforms they no longer wish to be a part of. Lastly, we provide choices on what social media providers can be utilized for initial registration. All of these capabilities make ForgeRock the Identity provider that companies can rely on to build the trust in their digital identity brand.</p>

<blockquote>The bill aims to clarify the country’s regulatory scenario for crypto&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><blockquote>It proposes to establish the country’s central bank as the regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposal needs approval from the Chamber of Deputies and its Senate to be enacted into&nbsp;law.</blockquote><p>The executive branch of Uruguay has submitted a bill to Congress that aims to clarify how crypto-related activities will be regulated in the South American country. The bill will give the country’s central bank legal powers to regulate cryptocurrencies if approved.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/realunique104/status/1570396845217816576?s=20&amp;t=-cJ3PKev2netfz_L0TENOg">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill is currently awaiting approval by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of the Senate for it to become&nbsp;law.</p> Virtual Assets Categorization <p>The document refers to virtual assets as securities and categorizes them into four types: tradable assets, stablecoins, governance tokens, and debt&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>On top of that, the bill proposes to create a new category of companies for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It further seeks to amend the organic charter of the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) and put VASPs under the supervision of the central bank entity, the Financial Services Superintendence (SSF).</p><blockquote>SSF will ensure that malicious elements do not use crypto assets to bypass the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) safeguards.</blockquote><p>Speaking of AML &amp; CFT safeguards, Uruguay hasn’t yet adopted the FATF Travel Rule, but if the country green-lights the crypto bill, it will adopt the Crypto Travel Rule sooner or&nbsp;later.</p> Giving Central Bank&nbsp;Control <p>Introduced on Sept 5, the proposed bill aims to amend the Securities Market Law and treat crypto assets as book-entry securities.</p><p>Such a treatment means crypto can only be issued by a registered entity that complies with laws and regulations. With this, the document introduces another class of operators, the “virtual asset&nbsp;issuer.”</p><p>This new organization will be in addition to companies facilitating the purchase and exchange of virtual assets, custody providers, and third parties that lend financial services related to the sale of a crypto asset that the text establishes as part of this asset&nbsp;class.</p><blockquote>“With the proposed amendments, both the previously regulated subjects and the new incorporated entities that operate with virtual assets will be subject to the supervisory and control powers of the Central Bank of Uruguay,” states the&nbsp;bill.</blockquote> Crypto Regulation in&nbsp;Focus <p>Last year in August, Uruguayan Senator Juan Sartori introduced a bill to allow the use of crypto as payments and regulate their use in the country. Yet, so far, it hasn’t been successful. Then the Central Bank of Uruguay issued Binance a summon due to its offering of savings-oriented crypto-based financial products.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1445139436186923015?s=20&amp;t=V1Pl14YWZ5dljQn6LzPpjg">Image Source</a>)<p>Towards the end of 2021, the central bank started working on a plan to lay the foundation for regulating companies that offer crypto-related services.</p><p>The South American country has now introduced a new cryptocurrency bill that will address the gray area in its crypto&nbsp;sector.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1519141072055775232?s=20&amp;t=xhaXN3AvW3HfaDy7-FaUjQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Interestingly, Uruguay’s neighboring country Brazil, the largest economy in the region, is also looking to change its legal framework to recognize crypto tokens as securities &amp; bring them under the SEC’s&nbsp;control.</p><p>The bill’s final version was approved by the Senate in April 2022 and needs Congress revision before being signed by the president.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1565746284081942529?s=20&amp;t=XxJQgiJ9Yi8QLYU5i2oZ7Q">Image Source</a>)<p>Meanwhile, in another South American country, Paraguay’s President Mario Abdo has <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining">vetoed a proposed crypto regulation bill</a>, stating crypto mining is an “energy-intensive” low-value-added activity. The bill has since been returned to Congress to be approved again or to be rejected.</p><p>It is to be seen if Uruguay gets ahead of Paraguay and Brazil in giving legal recognition to virtual assets. That said, a comprehensive crypto bill is a good start, nonetheless.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Why Implement Biometric MFA? 
<p>We are all aware of the risks associated with password-based authentication. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of password-based breaches that we see in the news every day. Some companies have attempted to mitigate password risks by adding two-factor authentication (2FA), pesky one-time codes sent via email or text.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you authenticate users who access your systems by way of username-password combinations, even if enhanced by so-called 2FA or MFA methods, then you could improve security a lot, reduce user friction, and cut operating expenses by implementing a biometrics-based solution.</p>
<p>While some solutions claim to solve these problems, many are only exchanging the password for FaceID/TouchID. These legacy apps fail to do the one thing that they are supposed to do – prove who the user is.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could prove each user’s identity every time they logged into a resource. That makes all of the other pillars much easier.</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers identity based Zero Trust- with real biometrics and cryptographic proof of possession and audit.</p>
 Identity Is One of the 6 Pillars of Zero Trust 
<p>Take this diagram:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other solutions base the “binding” on a username and password exchange which can be done by anyone. This is a problem because when an issue like a lost phone occurs, other solutions fall back to a username, password, 2FA as the bootstrapping process to re-enroll. What do you think the bad guys are going to do with this recovery process? That’s right, exploit it.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Prove Identity? 
<p>When a user downloads the BlockID app and enrolls, they will take a live selfie – This is part of our LiveID. Then, we ask the user for that selfie and compare it to their photo in government issued documents like a passport or a driver’s license. 1Kosmos matches the selfie with the documents, and gives the user a digital certificate that verifies their identity and it binds the account to the proven identity. When users authenticate through LiveID we compare the live selfie with the one taken at enrollment to prove identity and grant access.</p>
<p>To summarize, proving identity and reaching Zero Trust requires one platform that<br>
1)&nbsp; Establishes user-controlled identity<br>
2) Proves authentication with that previously established identity</p>
<p>There are two standards for identity and authentication: NIST 800-63-3 for ID enrollment and strong ID usage, and FIDO2 for passwordless. No platform besides BlockID has combined both of these into one experience. When done right, this single experience can replace many legacy processes and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/1kosmos/">FIDO</a>, BlockID’s live biometrics are <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1Kosmos-Biometric-Subsystem-Certification-Report-V2.0-1.pdf">iBeta</a> certified which validates the reliability of BlockID for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are other key values of the BlockID platform:<br>
– Can be <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrated</a> with every system that matters – Remote Access (VPN, Citrix, ZScaler, Appgate, etc.), Desktops (Mac/Windows), SSO systems (Okta/Azure AD/Ping), PAM (Cyberark/Thycotic)<br>
– Can be implemented in parallel, without impacting the existing mechanisms<br>
– Supports multiple company accounts in the same app: Domain Admin, Regular users, AD, Unix Account, etc.<br>
– Supports password reset in the app<br>
– Combines physical and logical access<br>
– Has built in integrity checking</p>

<p>65,000 USD in OCEAN is available for Web3 data economy projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grant DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month, retroactively, rewarding the projects that contributed the most value to the ecosystem.</p><p>Round 22 has 65K USD worth of OCEAN, or 200K OCEAN available, whichever is larger in USD terms. (Calculation is on October 10th, 2022, at midnight UTC.) 55K USD is available via the regular grants program, and 10K USD is via our micro-grants run by <a href="https://www.algovera.ai/">Algovera&nbsp;AI</a>.</p><p>Round 22&nbsp;Dates</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is October 11 at midnight&nbsp;UTC  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by Proposal Submission Deadline.  Two-day proposal Due Diligence Period ends October&nbsp;13  Voting Starts on October 13 @ midnight&nbsp;UTC  Voting Ends on October 17 @ midnight&nbsp;UTC  Funding Deadline on October&nbsp;30  <p>All times are midnight&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>OceanDAO Evolution</p><p>We are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who are engaged with the community and who are aligned with our value-add mission.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead  <p>We aim for OceanDAO to stay minimal (just grants; no treasury) and get more minimal yet; and double down on more automated incentives with lower governance attack surfaces (veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming).</p><p>Towards this, the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-21-is-live-690fd301b9c1">OceanDAO R21</a> post described some recent steps for R21 and planned steps for R22. While that post targeted a move to retroactive grants, upon deeper investigation we have found it to be high operational overhead, which we have instead focused towards veOCEAN. Therefore we are not moving to retroactive grants at this point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>We are moving towards these goals in other ways. First, in the vein of minimal OceanDAO, we are winding down the Parameters WG due to the low scope of governance, low turnout, and ongoing engineering work to further minimize governance. And, the OceanDAO Engineering WG will streamline to use of its OPF internal label as the “Nile”&nbsp;team.</p><p>Second, we are shifting more community budget to veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming (more automated, yet aligned objectives), and away from grants (higher governance touch). Therefore, R22 total grants will be 65K USD worth of OCEAN, and R23 total grants will be 45K USD worth of OCEAN (both including 10K USD to Algovera micro-grants). Max funding amounts have been tuned proportionally. The increased funding to veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming will lead to higher APYs for staking OCEAN and curating Ocean data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Round 22&nbsp;Specs</p>  Total funding of 65,000 USD&nbsp;(min.)  10,000 USD will be allocated for Algovera AI micro-grants.  100,000 USD max. per project in a&nbsp;lifetime  100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)  Funding ceiling per tier, in a round (max possible that a project can request in a round)&nbsp;:  New projects — 3K USD (New project: never previously received a grant from OceanDAO))  Existing projects — 6K USD (Existing project: have completed one grant from OceanDAO)  Experienced projects — 12K USD (Experienced project: have completed two or more&nbsp;grants)  <p>Grant Funding Categories</p><p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  The building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;Software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Submitting Proposals</p><p>We encourage you to submit proposals early.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-22/83">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the essential criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p><p>Teams can reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for any guidance or assistance.</p><p>Please, do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>Funding Tiers are achieved by teams delivering on their grant promises, to unlock higher funding ceilings.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.    Existing Project    Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.    Experienced Project    Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6,000 USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  3,000 USD For New Teams (non-outreach)  3,000 USD For New Teams (outreach)  12,000 USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  12,000 USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  25,000 USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There is specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-22-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R22</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features</p><p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept, and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes.

 Breaking Digital Borders: Scaling User-Owned Data from Zero to One Million — Key Takeaways <p>The Berlin Blockchain Week is an annual event that all web 3.0 enthusiasts, crypto experts, and techies from all walks of life look forward to. And this year, it was extra special for us at Affindi, as we showcased our Affinidi Console to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>On September 14, we hosted some of the most curious minds in Berlin at our “Breaking Digital Borders: Scaling User-Owned Data from Zero to One Million” event, as a part of the Berlin Blockchain week. Over some delicious food and drinks, Marco Podien, our Developer Evangelist, started the evening with his enthusiastic welcome.</p><p>Glenn Gore, the CEO of LemmaTree and Affinidi, was our first speaker, and he brought out the importance of changing data ownership for good and why it matters to everyone today. He described LemmaTree in general and Affinidi in particular, and also touched on the role of other ventures within LemmaTree, such as Trustana and GoodWorker.</p><p>Following Glenn, Junius Ho, our Chief Product Officer, talked about one of Affinidi’s most successful projects to date — the CommonCheck. He described the critical role that CommonCheck played in seamlessly verifying COVID vaccination credentials while preserving the privacy of every individual.</p><p>Next, Niandong Wang, our Chief Foundations Officer, took the stage. He started by explaining the ecosystem around data ownership and where Affinidi fits in. Next, Niandong talked about Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Affinidi Console, and the importance of a collaborative approach.</p><p>This introduction built the expectations for Affinidi Console, and Zain Yousaf, our Product Principal, and Marco took over to showcase our Affinidi Console to the audience. They did a walkthrough of the product to help everyone understand how they can build privacy-preserving apps with this dev&nbsp;tool.</p><p>This walkthrough and the potential impact of Affinidi Console created a buzz among our guests, and some of them wanted to know more about it. After an informal Q&amp;A session, we wrapped up a memorable day with pride in the journey so far, and looking forward to creating more impact in the world of data ownership and identity.</p><p>To know more about our Affinidi Console and to understand how it can fit into your organization, talk to <a href="mailto:marco.p@affinidi.com">Marco Podien</a> today.

<p>Back in 2020, I was going through a crisis of faith. I wasn’t sure if my involvement with Holochain was worth the effort. Sure, it was a noble idea. I mean, who doesn’t want to be more in charge of their own online lives? But I worried that it was a lot of energy wasted on the wrong solutions — maybe we’d convinced ourselves that the tech was more important than it really was. Maybe it was time for me to move on.</p><p>Then I learned about a group called Digital Democracy. They were building a mapping tool called <a href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/">Mapeo</a> with the help of Hypercore, a <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/">protocol</a> for peer-to-peer data sharing. But this tool wasn’t just for people who wanted to find the nearest coffee shop. It was being used by <a href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/ourwork/case_study_waorani/">indigenous groups</a> in the Amazon basin, people whose way of life was threatened by oil exploration. Mapeo allowed them to record the richness around them, from ancient burial sites to important food sources to ant nests. Eventually they were able to compile such a compelling argument for the preservation of their homeland that they won a lawsuit against a decision made by the Ecuadorian government that would have threatened their ecosystem; they currently live free from immediate danger.</p><p>That’s when I realised that decentralised tech matters. No, it’s not going to save the world, but it is a powerful, even transformative, tool in the hands of the right people. Mapeo couldn’t have been done as a traditional cloud app — there’s no internet out there in the rainforest. Only a peer-to-peer protocol was up for the task.</p><p>Two years later, I find myself at <a href="https://dweb.org">DWeb Camp</a>, an event in north California hosted by the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. All of us there have weathered many storms, from COVID to political unrest, and we’ve come out just a little disillusioned. But here, among colleagues, friends, and strangers, I find hope. It’s not that the people here are untouched by the grief and confusion of the past two years — it’s that they still believe we can move humanity’s course in better directions.</p><p>Here, I meet people who recognise that the tech that’s gotten us into such a nasty spot can also be used to help us create patches of light in the midst of darkness.</p><p>I hear <a href="https://twitter.com/jburrows">Jill Burrows</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanneUssher">Leanne Ussher</a> of <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> describe the way our global economy creates flows of goods and resources that degenerate the health of ecosystems and communities, then offer a new way of looking at economies that could shift us toward regeneration using digital tools for whole-systems accounting. And I get excited when I learn that real groups are ready to use them for their sustainable textile, food, and electronics supply chain networks.</p><p>I listen to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-tairea/">Ben Tairea</a> talk about <a href="https://ahau.io/">Āhau</a>, an app he’s creating with the help of <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>. Ãhau lets Māori families record and share their stories to keep them alive. For Ben, peer-to-peer tech is not just an ideological choice; it’s deeply rooted in pragmatism. He tells me that “from our villages’ perspectives, yeah, it was absolutely about — we want to have our own stories; we don’t want to be putting them on these platforms; we don’t want to be entrusting somebody else to hold onto that information for us. And we have heard horror stories of people that had been using different services that no longer existed, and so they lost their database.”</p><p>I witness demos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaaK6oXL6Ls">Social Sensemaker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a>, working examples of Holochain apps that help groups create healthy online social spaces to work and play in. These tools are built on peer-to-peer tech because, in the eyes of the projects’ creators, that’s the only way for a group to assert their power to create the software, data, and infrastructure that suits them best. We lets you cobble together little configurable applets — “generic tech, specific culture”, in the words of <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a> founder <a href="https://twitter.com/SidSthalekar/">Sid Sthalekar</a>. Both of these projects aim to carve out areas of sovereignty in an internet where big platforms define the game and choose who can play, often leading to ideological polarisation and disempowerment.</p><p>I listen to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2022/08/25/introducing-the-2022-dweb-fellows/">DWeb Fellows</a> from Brazil, Colombia, India, and Mexico share their experiences helping build community-governed internet and cellular networks where they live. These networks give indigenous and rural people access to the power of global connectivity while preserving their right to engage on their own terms.</p>DWeb Fellows share their experiences helping to build community-run mesh and cell networks<p>I chat with countless people who are devoting themselves to beautiful, courageous, demanding visions of a future they want to live in. Every one of their stories is a gift of hope that I will carry home with me.</p><p>I see people from all sorts of outlooks — not just rich white tech bros but children, wise sages, trans people, people from the global south and indigenous territories in the north.</p><p>One thing that I notice repeatedly is people building bridges instead of shouting at each other from their own islands. They arrive with open minds, ready to share and listen, ready to build a web with <a href="https://twitter.com/GETDWeb/status/1569371422392483840">many winners</a>. Scuttlebutt and Holochain folks show up at each other’s workshops. People from various governance camps put their heads together to find new approaches to the wicked problems of the internet. And many people without a stake in any project show up to discover allies and tools that can help them in their journey to improve their corner of the world.</p>People discuss digitally augmented governance at a workshop<p>This feels different from DWeb Camp 2019 and the DWeb Summits that came before it. I’m not the only one to notice it; afterwards some of my colleagues echo the same feeling. We think things in the <a href="https://getdweb.net/">DWeb</a> community are shifting — from solo acts to ensemble pieces, from head to heart, from thoughts to actions, from beliefs to relationships. This event both displays and <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/our-mission/">nurtures</a> that spirit, thanks in large part to the careful and heart-led work of Wendy Hanamura and her team of organisers, space stewards, and volunteers.</p><p>And that makes sense. We’re here, not because of technology, but because of the things we want to see birthed in the world. Of course, we’re united in believing the DWeb is a tool that can help our work immensely. But it’s ultimately just a tool. We — you and I, and the rest of us — are the ones who are going to make change happen.</p> How about Holochain? <p>While I would love to focus entirely on the beautiful community spirit, I know some of you want to know what the Holochain community was up to. Here are some highlights, in no particular order:</p>  Jill Burrows, Leanne Ussher, and <a href="https://github.com/weswalla">Wesley Finck</a> presented a talk and a workshop on <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> and its underlying ontology, <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a>, which describes itself as “a vocabulary for the distributed economic networks of the next economy”. The workshop, which focused on practical applications to real economies, was attended by all sorts of people interested in regenerative economics, not just Holochain folks.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamieklinger">Jamie Klinger</a> gave a lightning talk on the ideas behind <a href="https://metacurrency.org/">Metacurrency</a> and <a href="https://metacurrency.org/portfolio-item/deep-wealth-a-post-monetary-jazz-ensemble/">Deep Wealth</a>.  Wes and <a href="https://twitter.com/zippy314/">Eric Harris-Braun</a> gave a lightning talk on the organisational principles behind <a href="https://acorn.software">Acorn</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/emalinus4">Emaline Friedman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mhuesch">Michael Hueschen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/sidsthalekar">Sid Sthalekar</a> gave a demo of <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a>’ Social Sensemaker engine that allows groups to define their own cultural and reputational norms in the form of metadata that can be calculated against contributions, then filtered and sorted. Once again, a lot of people from other projects showed up, which led to a lively discussion of how reputation systems can and should be designed.  <a href="https://twitter.com/5thingol">Guillem Cordoba</a> and Eric Harris-Braun gave a demo of <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a>, showing how groups can create and customise their own spaces to communicate and get things done. I was particularly impressed by a <a href="https://youtu.be/oKD2HlLqpI8">toggle</a> that lets you switch your UI from a group-centric perspective to an agent-centric perspective that shows information from all the groups you participate in.  <a href="http://twitter.com/zaunders/">Viktor Zaunders</a> led a brainstorming session to identify useful applets to add to We. And once again, this event attracted people from outside the Holochain sphere. This led to small group discussions about one of my favourite topics — how to build bridges between different DWeb protocols.  Eric and Art led a discussion on governance in DAOs and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">other forms</a> of organisations, along with the tools and processes needed to support them.  Paul Krafel, an unwitting mentor of many people in the Holochain community through his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548071.Seeing_Nature">Seeing Nature</a>, held a Q&amp;A about his book and led a few exercises in learning to see flows in nature and human interactions.  Eric Bear gave from his heart as a volunteer and Space Steward, organising event schedules, helping people feel supported, and generally cultivating a feeling of care and connection among participants.  I took lots of photos and videos for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2022">Internet Archive</a> — I even got to film an impromptu wedding!  Some of us participated in a meet-and-greet session — Marcus (the lead facilitator of our recent <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/life-imitates-art-imitates-life-cooperation-at-the-first-developer-immersive/">Developer Immersive</a>) and his partner Kaitlyn treated everyone to charcuterie and we all got to share what Holochain is about with anyone who was curious.  Every one of us found ourselves in many conversations about a thousand subjects — governance, education, economics, sovereignty, and of course Holochain.  After DWeb Camp ended, the Internet Archive graciously lent us space in their San Francisco headquarters so the remaining participants could plan the future of Holochain and its community together.   Postscript <p>I want to leave you with this piece I recorded at DWeb Camp called Five by Four, performed by the <a href="https://www.delsolquartet.com/">Del Sol Quartet</a> and written by their violist Charlton Lee. As you listen to it, pay attention to the story the musicians are telling. At first, it almost seems confused, as if they’re trying to figure out how to play with each other. The notes don’t fit quite right. Some are playing in 4/4; others in 5/4.</p><p>As the piece moves on, the apparent discord begins to resolve — gradually at first, then rapidly. Rather than give up their individual perspectives, they blend them together in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o11VT-g5sBA">upward spiral</a> of greater coherence, greater beauty. Some are still playing 4/4 and others 5/4, but their contributions only add to the richness; each individual gracefully dances with the rest of the ensemble.</p><p>And I love watching their body language. The subtle glances, the smiles and grimaces, the moment-to-moment changes of bow and finger. There’s no leader to keep them all in sync, and the sheet music only gives the notes. The music comes alive because of these human signals, carrying a much higher bandwidth than conductor or ink could.</p><p>For me, this piece tells the story of the DWeb, both the present moment of the people building it and the rhythm and notes of the societies we hope to help nurture. We’re growing in our capacity to cooperate, and I think that’s an important prerequisite if we want to help the world do the same. Let’s hope that we may continue to build bridges, connect our islands, come together to create many ensemble pieces.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap (September 12th — September 18th) <p>Welcome to another exciting edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In this week’s edition, we look at the recent crypto regulation guiding principles published by Abu Dhabi FSRA to the White House’s first-ever digital assets regulatory framework. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Abu Dhabi FSRA Publishes Crypto Regulation Guiding Principles (<a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/en/plan-your-visit/visiting-uae/visiting-abudhabi">Image Source</a>)<p>In its new guidelines that define six key principles on which its approach would be built, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Free Economic Zone (ADGM) defined its regulatory approach to virtual asset activities.</p><blockquote>The agency highlighted four “risk drivers” that need heightened focus, one of which relates to the obligations of virtual asset custodians, even when they contract out work to external&nbsp;parties.</blockquote><p>There will also be an emphasis on technology and governance controls that businesses use. The FSRA also plans to examine whether companies adhere to legal obligations when exchanging virtual assets, particularly to ensure that laws intended to safeguard virtual asset investors, such as disclosure requirements, are being followed.</p><blockquote>As such, the new guide reaffirms the FSRA’s dedication to providing a strong, transparent, and consistent regulatory framework for companies engaging in virtual asset activities, prosecuting regulatory violations, and upholding “high standards” throughout the authorization process.</blockquote><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://www.adgm.com/documents/legal-framework/guidance-and-policy/fsra/fsra-guiding-principles-for-virtual-assets-regulation-and-supervision-ia-202209012.pdf">https://www.adgm.com/documents/legal-framework/guidance-and-policy/fsra/fsra-guiding-principles-for-virtual-assets-regulation-and-supervision-ia-202209012.pdf</a></p> SEC’s Gary Gensler Says Proof-of-Stake Crypto May be Securities (<a href="https://twitter.com/sandy_carter/status/1571073767857860608?s=20&amp;t=tGq4RK-G_OYu3txrUKImJg">Image Source</a>)<p>Recently, Gary Gensler, the current SEC supremo, insisted that any cryptocurrencies that follow the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism are likely to be securities.</p><blockquote>In his own words, PoS blockchains “might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security.”</blockquote><p>As for how a distinction is made between crypto, which is a security, and one that is not, courts utilize the Howey test to evaluate it by determining whether an investor expects to make money from owning the respective asset.</p><p>This statement from Gensler is pretty significant, considering that it comes at the heels of the successful Ethereum merge rollout, which marks its move from the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the Proof of Stake&nbsp;(PoS).</p><p>Interestingly, there were rumors that Gensler wanted to backtrack from the previous SEC stance that Ethereum is a non-security, but he was held back by a lack of sound reasoning to pull this off.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>The cost of cyber-attacks to the global economy has risen to more than 400 billion US dollars per year. Cyber-attacks affect every business, from small companies to enterprises and governments. Recovering from attacks is expensive and time-consuming. So, how to make an organization more resilient to cyber-attacks in today’s digital world?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital transformation has changed the business and delivered new opportunities to organizations. However, going digital also increased the risk of becoming a victim of a cyber-crime. Fighting cyber-attacks are an unfair battle because companies face a silent enemy. In most successful attacks, organizations only learn about the attack when it is already too late. This is the case with ransomware, an attack that encrypts files and frequently also steals data of an organization until a ransom payment is made. Nitish Deshpande describes the evolution of ransomware in an article "<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/deshpande/ransomware-in-2022">How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware in 2022</a>".</p>
 Attacks have no border&nbsp; 
<p>In the last years we have seen many different ransomware attacks across the globe affecting every industry and organizations of all sizes. Several of these attacks caused major damage. Here are some prominent examples of the past few years:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 In 2019 the city of Baltimore was a victim of a ransomware attack called “RobinHood”. This attack encrypted files and shut down all the servers except essential services. Attackers claimed a ransom of 100 thousand US dollars to give the access back to the state and threatened with permanently deleting the data. Consequences reached enormous proportions: real estate transactions could not be completed, card payment and debt checking were inaccessible, and city employees lost access to their email accounts. The recovery took the city several months and costed approximately 18 million US dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 At the beginning of 2021 the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack left the US in checkmate. A bug invaded the system and impacted the computerized equipment managing the pipeline.&nbsp; President Biden declared a state emergency in Virginia since 71% of the filling stations in the area were out of fuel for several days. This was known as the largest cyber-attack on an oil infrastructure target in the history. Overseen by the FBI, the company paid the amount asked by the attackers to sort the problem: 4.4 million US dollars. 
 In May 2021, the Health Service Executive of Ireland suffered a major ransomware attack that affected the entire country and caused the IT systems to be shut down nationwide. The attackers claimed 20 million US dollars threatened to publish patients’ information online. The Irish government did not pay the ransom and, unfortunately, data of 520 patients have been published. Ireland spent more than 100 million US dollars to recover the HSE system after the ransomware attack. 
 In May 2022, the Ministry of Finance of Costa Rica was hit by a ransomware attack that affected, among others, customs, and HR systems. The consequences affected the national economy, especially because the customs stopped processing import and export taxes and the salary of public employees was suspended for a month. The government declined negotiations with the muggers, but it ended up paying high expenses anyway: 9 million US dollars were used from the reserve to pay the salaries and pending movements that were on hold due to the attack. The country remains under national emergency alert. 
 
 The beneath of the iceberg&nbsp; 
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp; it is not possible to avoid attempts of attacks, and there has been a considerable increase of ransomware attacks since the COVID-19 outbreak:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/ransomware-during-the-pandemic-crisis">Ransomware During the Pandemic Crisis</a>. Companies need to prepare themselves as best as they can to survive that moment. The obvious detriments are related to data compliance, technical issues, and large investments in the cybersecurity system. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The damage on a brand name is difficult to revert. The brand is one of the most valuable assets in business and being the target of a cyber-crime would devaluate the name and reputation of the company. This is a major issue since there are several expenses arising out of it such as losing reputation and breaking current customer relationships, devaluation of trade name of the organization, and high costs due to operational disruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intellectual property loss is another major issue. It damages the name of the organization, as well as slowdown the business growth.&nbsp; If third parties access trade secrets or publish documents that are under copyright, it would be hard to recover customers’ trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would require efforts from different teams, which means time spent to sort this problem, and thus money loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing a company needs to become a target is to be online, and as such, the key is to stop thinking about “if a cyber-crime occurs” and change the mindset to “when the attack comes”. Becoming more resilient and vigilant is part of a good cybersecurity strategy. Mike Small, a Senior Analyst of KuppingerCole explains this very well and advice steps to follow&nbsp; in case of the worst scenario: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/when-will-ransomware-strike-disaster-planning">When will Ransomware Strike? Plan for the Worst</a>.</p>
<p>It is vital to realize that while cybersecurity professionals work on refining the prevention tools, hackers are developing in parallel their tactics, techniques, and procedures to bypass the controls and succeed in their next attack.&nbsp; The priority then, is understanding the potential risks and focusing on programs to minimize the impact and thrive against a cyber-crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Daily Crypto News: The latest news about Ethereum Merge drove much more attention to the Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism. Layer 2 projects focus more on performance expansion, while Layer 3 on custom applications serving different scenarios, such as privacy, and enterprise-level blockchain services. As covered in this Chinese article, these concepts are allusive to the Ardor public PoS blockchain and its unique muti-chain architecture launched in 2018, already presenting a solid solution to the blockchain bloat problem with the pruning functionality. Moreover, Ardor presents three main advantages: Out-of-the-box features on the Ignis child chain, high interoperability between all Ardor’s child chains, and high scalability. Thus, the Ardor ecosystem has demonstrated several real-world applications that helped position Jelurida as a top-solutions provider to traditional blockchain problems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-28-million-fraud-reports-consumers-2021-0">FTC</a>, American consumers reported losing over $2.3B to imposter scams in 2021. Meanwhile, across the pond, <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/government-coordinated-action-needed-fraud-losses-rise-30-cent">UK Finance</a> reported that losses due to authorized push payment fraud rose by 71% in the first half of 2021 in the UK, the same report stating that the amount of money stolen through this type of scam even overtook card fraud losses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, financial institutions need to find ways to effectively combat thes massive losses that can come from APP fraud before they’re left footing the bill.</p>

   How to protect your organization from a social engineering attack 

<p>Cyberhacks are commonplace in today's world, and they can happen to any company. Today it's Uber, last week it was U-Haul and the week before it was Samsung. At the root of many of these attacks is a malicious actor masquerading as a corporate IT manager or other technical role. Using this disguise, the perpetrator knows that all they have to do is convince one employee or contractor to share their credentials to gain a foothold into the targeted company's internal network. This tactic is called social engineering and is one of the key methods used in attacks that result in data breaches. These types of "unauthorized access" attacks account for 50% of all data breaches and can cost companies as much as $9.5M dollars to remediate per incident.</p>

<p>It's a frustrating reality for CIOs because these types of breaches are preventable as long as their companies implement the right technologies, policies, and procedures and educate their employees on how to be extra vigilant in the digital world.</p>

<p>In my experience, one of the most difficult aspects of protecting an organization is making sure all team members understand the importance of building security into their everyday roles. Employees need to adopt the mindset of "security first." Simple things such as not clicking on unknown attachments or deleting a suspicious request for a passcode are easy ways to stay out of harm's way.</p>

<p>CIOs must come to grips with the fact that we're all human and that shortcuts don't have a place when developing strong cybersecurity habits. Even the smallest and seemingly insignificant technical toe-stub can open the door to a potential bad actor. Our job is to look at the problem holistically. No amount of investment in the latest technology can provide 100% protection because technology alone is not enough. It has to be complemented with well-designed, enforceable policies, proven procedures, and strong system hygiene coupled with continuous education and awareness.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some practical steps you can take to protect your organization now:</p>
	
  Embrace zero trust. 
   Building strong policies and procedures. 
   Continuously educating your workforce. 
  Zero Trust Goes Beyond Products 
	
<p>Zero trust is built on the principle that no person or device inside or outside of an organization's network should be granted access to connect to systems until authenticated and continuously verified. A CIO's top priority is to incorporate zero trust into their approach to cyber security.</p>

<p>User access must be calculated constantly from as many different data points as possible. Companies need to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to combat account takeovers and tackle fraud at the front door and subsequently throughout their networks.</p>

<p>As an example, the ForgeRock Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform continuously assesses risk as part of its access management capability to provide a zero trust environment. However zero trust needs to be applied to everything we do online. This means deploying the best cybersecurity technology that implements a zero trust paradigm; developing and implementing policies and procedures that reinforce zero trust and redundancy; and educating users and systems administrators to follow procedures that mitigate risk.</p>

 Build Strong Policies and Procedures 
	
<p>Most successful attacks are the result of routine lapses and failing to know what endpoints are connecting to your network. To prevent this, it is important to practice good cyber hygiene by patching operating systems and applications, backing up data, updating and whitelisting applications, limiting privileges, and using multi-factor (MFA) authentication</p>

<p>CIOs need to understand where their technology assets are, what software is in use company-wide, and identify unsanctioned software which, more often than not, has not been properly configured, patched, updated, or secured, creating an attractive entry point for attackers.</p>

<p>Internal hygiene is critical, and that includes ensuring that system level usernames and passwords are not hard-coded. If that is necessary, make sure there is regular rotation of those system passwords. Performing regular, routine maintenance, automated patching, and isolating personal devices is all part of ensuring your organization is protected.</p>

 Continuously Educate Your Workforce 
	
<p>Outside of technology, there is the element of human error and risk. It is critical to any business that employees are regularly educated and tested to ensure they have a strong understanding of cyber risk and the part they play in minimizing it.</p>

<p>One important and often overlooked element is social engineering education. For example, how much personal information are your employees actually sharing online via social media such as LinkedIn or FaceBook? This is an increasingly strong attack vector that bad actors use to understand the structure of a company. I've seen attackers target new, junior employees with a high pressure, time-sensitive request seemingly from a senior member of staff to unlock access to a company's network.</p>

<p>Finding new ways to keep your teams educated requires some serious thought. Training should not be a "one size fits all" approach. It needs to be tailored to teams and roles. I am sure that sometimes I drive my team crazy, but I have been known, on occasion, to contact my help desk team in an attempt to impersonate various employee roles to ensure they stay on their toes. I think it's an important aspect of understanding the maturity of a team with elevated access to many systems.</p>

<p>Phishing scams are another common method used to gain unauthorized access. Employees should be trained to identify malicious emails, URLs, and attachments that often are sent by attackers to their corporate or personal inboxes, or any other avenue, such as SMS.</p>

<p>Lastly, training has to be non-negotiable. Companies need to follow up to ensure that employees have participated in relevant training and fully understood its implications. Furthermore, employers need to make it clear there are ramifications should individuals intentionally circumvent security policies and procedures.</p>

<p>The correct balance for preventing any cyber attack spans people, process and technology. If you get that trio right, your organization will thrive.</p>

<p>1Kosmos had the pleasure of attending the Gartner IAM Summit 2022 in Las Vegas. It was our first time exhibiting and sponsoring the event. I have to say it was great to see long time friends, former colleagues, customers, partners and prospects. It was a great feeling to meet people face to face again. As we move beyond our COVID shutdown, it makes me appreciate the things I lost appreciation for. For me, the show was very busy. It felt as though everyone came out just to go meet the folks that they used to be in touch with!</p>
<p>I attended as many sessions as I could balancing my time between meeting customers at the booth and attending the highly informative sessions.</p>
<p>In this blog, I wanted to share some observations and highlights of the event because I know not everyone had an opportunity to attend.</p>
<p>1. Passwordless is a Day 0 imperative</p>
<p>My first observation was that <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/password-alternatives/">passwordless</a> authentication was a frequent (or top of mind) topic. Gartner VP Analyst Ant Allen has been talking about the end of passwords and the need to eliminate them for years! Based on the presentations and focus of the exhibitors, this is a hot topic. I was happy to see that the discussion has moved past just passwordless and in fact it is simply “expected “ now. Gartner took it much further in fact, and described the journey to MFA and RBA (risk based authentication). And then they dropped the big one- Continuous Adaptive Trust! Learn from the environment. Learn from the user’s previous access and form an opinion about the inherent risk of each new access. I believe this is where the world of user authentication is headed and selfishly, no one can provide Day 0 passwordless as we can here at 1Kosmos. But, yes it’s good to see the market and analysts move in our direction. Also, passwordless is accelerating across workforce, customer, and citizen use cases.</p>
<p>In speaking with attendees, many express some doubt about their ability to achieve the goal of being passwordless or communicate that they don’t know where or how to start. Of course, I was more than happy to talk about our approach and show prospects how it’s not only possible but, with our approach, it’s very practical, and it provides an excellent experience for users. I said it here- passwordless is just the beginning and there is much much more to come to remove friction from secure user access journeys!</p>
<p>2. Signal Orchestration with Predictive Analytics</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-mfa-zero-trust/">Multi-factor authentication</a> is an absolute must these days. That’s nothing new. But what was new is the need to move past a risk based (RBA) model and into a continuous authentication model. The shift will ultimately mean that authentication journeys will not be preordained as it is today. The industry will move from a stepwise imperative to a desired end-state declarative model!</p>
<p>With the addition of signals, security teams can orchestrate the appropriate journey based on the user and their action. For example, security teams could base authentication on a NIST IAL level. If the user does not meet that IAL requirement, say they are IAL 1 presently but they need to be IAL2, then the system would adaptively put them through a journey to achieve the assertion corresponding to a NIST IAL2 level!</p>
<p>This move to a predictive – based on AI/ML – approach to access via declarative journeys and orchestration will be the future of access management. The shift here is that currently security teams already know the signals they are supposed to be looking for. So security is based on what is known. But the world is moving on. The hackers have moved on. We need to move to a continuous model – Adaptive trust. This is another way of saying we need to try to predict when the system might be at a higher level of compromise or threat, and then go and introduce obstacles, sensible obstacles, contextual obstacles, into the authentication journey. That’s really what they were trying to drive towards.</p>
<p>3. Web3 and the Rise of Privacy!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/decentralized-web/">Web3</a> was a surprising discussion point. What was clear is that this is in its infancy. Many are talking about – specs, requirements, technology, and even implementations but the strategic imperative is clear.</p>
<p>Web3 is promising a complete redesign of the web as we know it.<br>
Decentralized compute, storage, and always-on application execution will be executed via distributed ledgers.<br>
Everything will live on a blockchain and will have an address. All nodes work together to compute, verify, and record the state change of the tokens (the things that represent value), which will lead to a token economy.<br>
An application called a wallet is the human interface to the blockchain technology stack. It holds the seed phase, all your blockchain accounts/addresses, the corresponding public/private key pairs, your tokens, and above all, initiates the state change. Early talks of a standard to allow for wallets to work anywhere are underway.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. Web3 promises a utopia where everyone online is a known entity. No more anonymity but the fundamental principle to uphold will remain user privacy. Users and creators alike will need, and regulations will mandate, a consent driven journey with sufficient recourse available to users for consent revocation. These drivers will, over time, fundamentally alter the way we engage online. Gartner is already beginning the analysis.</p>
<p>While this is just a high level view, there was more to the event than just this. But these were my key takeaways. As a PM I already have much of this in production, in development, or on a roadmap. As an organization and the leader of the strategic direction of our platform I believe we are headed in the right direction to help you meet the future demands of your workers, customers or citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consumers are embracing digital payments and turning to fintech for everyday finance needs. According to Mastercard’s 2022 Global New Payments Index, emerging payment methods like account-to-account payments, digital wallets and Buy Now, Pay Later are all on the rise. Eighty-five percent of consumers have used a digital payment method within the last year. And 93% are likely to use a digital payment method in the coming year.</p>



<p>Many of these emerging digital payments are powered by open banking and are a natural progression of the shifting landscape of payments. Through our latest research, we wanted to share five key trends to consider when integrating digital payments into your fintech innovation.</p>



 1. Consumers want convenience when paying bills 



<p>Consumers across the globe are relying on digital channels for paying bills because it is more convenient and makes it easier to manage finances.</p>



<p>Subscriptions, bills, utilities, loan repayment and retail payments are more convenient with open banking-powered apps and services. Eighty-one percent of consumers have already heard of account-to-account payments, but they may not know that open banking added speed and convenience to A2A, or that A2A payments can now be made at the point of sale, without typing in card details or writing checks.</p>







 2. Consumers seek flexibility in making payments 



<p>The majority of global consumers want the flexibility and control to optimize digital payments. Similar to the motivations around bill pay, consumers are connecting their accounts to automate repayment for BNPL and installment loans. Fifty-eight percent of consumers are open to connecting their bank account to other financial services to enable automatic repayments, and 52% percent say that they use digital repayment tools because they help to prevent missed or late payments.</p>







 3. Security is top of mind 



<p>Consumers recognize the convenience that digital payments offer, and security remains a top concern, highlighting an opportunity for providers to build trust. Building comfort with emerging digital payments is key to supporting future adoption as the two trend together. Faster transactions, convenience and transparency are the top reasons that help consumers overcome security concerns.</p>







 4. Consumers rely on fintech to manage finances 



<p>Consumers are relying on fintech, and indirectly open banking, to accomplish everyday financial tasks. Eighty-three percent of consumers have used digital tools for at least one financial task, and over half use technology to accomplish five or more tasks. The majority see making a payment as the most beneficial use case.</p>







 5. Emerging payments are strongest among Gen Z and Millennials 



<p>Younger generations have gone more digital in their purchasing and payments behavior globally and it’s anticipated that their use will continue to increase. These generations are less likely to make in-person purchases and payments: 50% for Gen Z compared to 78% of Boomers. They are also less likely to use cash for purchases. While security remains a concern for them, it is less heightened than for older audiences.</p>







<p>Building the Future of Payment Choice at Mastercard</p>



<p>At Mastercard, we have always powered experiences that enable customer choice. Our solutions are built to meet consumers’ financial needs and designed with security at the center.</p>



<p>In recent years, we have further differentiated Mastercard in the market by diversifying beyond the card. We’ve built a complementary open banking platform that enables ACH and account-based payments with best-in-class capabilities across infrastructure, applications and services. Empowering people to pay and get paid using a card, bank account, cryptocurrency, or even cash. Using any device or no device. In real-time or later, truly empowering people with flexibility and control.</p>

 With the common use of heuristics and especially the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in automated cyber threat mitigation, why do we still need to focus on user cybersecurity awareness?&nbsp; 
 
<p>In cybersecurity, there never was just one solution to reduce risk or fix mitigations. But you always need multiple layers of security. So each layer consists of additional aspects. Software and hardware measures are excellent at catching mass and known threats, with the advance in AI and also the detection of new threats based on known issues. But we can never neglect the human factor as a first, but also the most important line of defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often give the example of driving a car. You can make a car very safe to drive with airbags, ABS, and even some measures with automatic street lane detection and object detection. But even with all the advances in self-driving, at least for now, you still need a human who knows how to drive so that a person can react in new or unexpected situations. This is the same for technology and specifically cybersecurity, therefore users need to have an awareness that we need them to fight cyber threats and crime. So if users know how important they are and how they can help, this can only be our advantage. So give them the knowledge, train them and users can be a first, last, and often also the best line of defense.&nbsp;</p>
 What are methods of cyber social engineering and how to identify them?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Social engineering is an age-old tactic to trick people into doing something they do not want to do. So users are tricked by communication, emails, phone, SMS, or videos pretending to be from trusted parties such as banks, colleagues, executives, online payment processors, IT admins, or social websites. So all social engineering attacks have one or more common traits. The scammer will focus on your good nature and human emotions. The criminal will use a false title, a position of authority, for example, as someone you would normally trust, a bank manager, social services, a doctor, etc. and they will try to create an urgency, a time-sensitive situation which will put you under pressure and to act. They may request urgent information, money, or something similar for their criminal gain. So currently the most prevalent social engineering attacks we have seen are via email, voice, SMS, and social messaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social engineering attempts via email are called email phishing or business email compromise. So even with the constant barrage of emails everyone receives, it's normally not difficult to recognize them. Was the email expected? is the first question you should ask yourself. Check from whom this email is. Is the sending domain suspicious or are there some obvious misspellings? Many companies also use technology to insert an external email banner warning to indicate that this email is from outside of their organization. You always should remain suspicious if there is an attachment that asks to enable macros, in office documents mostly, and also be very careful if the email has some information that tries to raise a sense of urgency, "You need to do this immediately", this is always a warning sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very similar to phone phishing attempts, where criminals may try to lure victims into handing over valuable information. Employee names, title roles, or anything like that. So they will normally call via the switchboard or directly from an unfamiliar number claiming to be a colleague or a well-known vendor, or a third party and create again a sense of urgency with their request. Similar to SMS phishing, people may receive SMS messages asking for a piece of personal information or asking to click on links. This SMS may look legitimate, being from a bank or parcel delivery service or something similar. Always, before clicking or replying, check if this SMS was expected and if the link goes to a legitimate website. And of course, keep your mobile phone updated to avoid security exploits.&nbsp;</p>
 How did the increased Working from Home change the cyber threat landscape in the last two years from a user perspective?&nbsp; 
<p>Let's start with something outside of the cyber domain, but still related to safety, specifically health and safety. What we have learned in the last two years is that it is important to have an environment at home which enables a safe, healthy, and economical workspace. So this means having sufficient and good lighting, a comfortable and ergonomic chair and the right size desk is much better than sitting on the kitchen table or working from a sofa. But working from home reminded us also to be mindful of who and what is around us when conducting confidential work conversations. So do not discuss confidential information with your IoT devices like Alexa or Google Home nearby, in case they may be listening and sending it to their servers. So, collaboration with your team is very important. It is vital when you are working remotely, but make sure to only use company-approved methods for communication. Don't use any personal or social media apps to discuss work-related topics and of course, the usual advice, upgrade your home network and any personal computers, game consoles, internet-connected TVs, baby monitors, and other IoT devices, and never use a default password. So the security basics also apply at home - or even more at home.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we expect from your talk at CSLS 2022?&nbsp; 
<p>We have traditionally seen cybersecurity as a domain for technology, with the expectation that solutions for cyber resilience have to be provided by IT. And we happily accepted this challenge and deliver numerous software and hardware solutions, design and development principles, policies, and process controls. However, the most successful cyber attacks in recent times have started with targeting users with phishing emails or other kinds of social engineering, and therefore raising awareness of the users' role in increasing cyber resilience is at least as important as providing just a technical solution. So my presentation will be based on a very famous example, a real robbery in Berlin in the early 19th century showing how user awareness can become an important line of defense in cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>

 It’s time we had a serious discussion about the risk-based system…&nbsp; 



 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6c5ab95-7be4-432c-83a5-79b7471afc1a">fraud epidemic</a> is sweeping the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criminals bilked UK victims of a record £1.3 billion in 2021, according to new<a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/"> </a><a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/">figures</a> by top industry lobby group UK Finance. The numbers were so bad that publication of the report was <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/annual-fraud-report-2022">delayed</a> for banks to consider their response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 91% of identity fraud cases reported to UK authorities in 2021 were carried out online. Although anyone can fall victim to online fraud, tackling it is not a priority for law enforcement, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/158/treasury-committee/news/166100/treasury-committee-publishes-government-response-to-fraud-scams-and-economic-crime-report/">according to the government</a>. Instead, firms are being asked to do more to protect their customers and themselves or run the risk of heavy fines or even criminal sanctions for non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year of 2020 saw a record-breaking <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202109/financial-institutions-fined-nearly-11b-worldwide-for-kyc-regulatory-non-compliance">£9.2 billion</a> in penalties for KYC and customer identification failures, which triggered a demand for outsourced services and better technology, with automation of key onboarding processes deemed as particularly vital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digitization has revolutionized the finance landscape and left manual ID verification processes firmly in the past; customers no longer want to wait days or weeks for their accounts to be approved, and they want to be able to do all this through their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking to IDnow on condition of anonymity, the Head of Operational Risk at a mid-tier UK investment bank said: “I believe, and I am not alone, there are significant problems, weaknesses with how external auditors check over all applications manually. It’s just too time-consuming, expensive and prone to errors. We are looking at how we can automate more and it’s the same issue whoever you ask up and down the street.”&nbsp;</p>



 Lost in the wash&nbsp; 



<p>The advanced payments infrastructure, almost zero policing of fraud-related crime, and use of the world’s most widely used business language, has made Britain the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/welcome-britain-bank-scam-capital-world-2021-10-14/">global incubator for scams</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money launderers exploit the poor standard of identification checks, the weaknesses in manual processes and physical documentation requirements to slip through the net.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just two years ago, Commerzbank’s London branch was <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-commerzbank-london-37805400-over-anti-money-laundering-failures">fined more than £37 million</a> for a series of compliance failings, including outdated customer onboarding processes. The bank allowed a queue of 2,350 accounts awaiting background checks to build up, but some were able to trade freely, in clear contravention of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the near-constant updates to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) laws, knowing exactly who their clients are appears a problem for many UK financial services firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk-based approach to<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/"> Know Your Customer (KYC) </a>processes favored by the UK, but eschewed in most other developed nations, is gatekeeper to an environment where fraud continues to run rampant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>” In the Western world, it is almost impossible to find a major, global bank that has not been sanctioned for AML or other financial crime failings in recent years.</p>



<blockquote><p>Now that AML-related concerns and failings have resulted in many large banks being sanctioned, regulators are beginning to pay increased attention to other areas of financial services.</p> Malin Nilsson, Managing Director, Financial Services Compliance and Regulation at Kroll</blockquote>



<p>For example, regulators have started to implement guidance for digital identity verification, such as in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> released in 2020. In it, it states that an obliged entity must identify the customer, either through traditional documentary evidence or information obtained from a reliable and independent source, including electronic identification means. Those electronic identification methods must comply with <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910">Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014</a>, which sets out criteria for identity verification services.&nbsp;</p>



 Outdated processes&nbsp; 



<p>Before assessing the risks associated with a customer in relation to money laundering or financing of terrorism, financial institutions must first verify the individual’s identity. This is done via the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20helps%20banks%20to%20comply,money%20laundering%2C%20corruption%20or%20bribery.">KYC process</a>, which involves scrutiny of government-issued identification documents, such as a passport or driver’s licence, or other means, such as utility bills or bank statements to ensure the customer or client is who they say they are, and to prevent illicit activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that process looks like differs around the world (which creates complications of its own), but there are a set of general guidelines overseen by a global group of regulators from various jurisdictions sitting as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force</a> (FATF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/know-your-customer-guidance/know-your-customer-guidance-accessible-version">The UK’s interpretation</a> of these rules requires firms to take a risk-based approach, which means assessing the specific threats the business is exposed to, such as banking vulnerable or politically exposed individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current rules and regulations were originally created to address the risks and controls associated with retail banking, which has unintentionally created regulatory barriers and AML complications for non-banks like PayPal, alongside other fintechs, and sectors like online gambling and crypto trading companies. A “low risk” for a bank may be a “high risk” for another sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As legislation around anti-money laundering and risk-based-approaches was largely written in the pre-digital era, access to the data that helps firms calculate risk was limited. Ironically, there is now almost too much data to handle, with many organizations struggling to take advantage of the insights and technology available to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Thomson Reuters investigation <a href="https://www.bobsguide.com/articles/kyc-pain-financial-institutions-and-their-clients-are-still-struggling-with-ongoing-challenges/">into KYC challenges</a> impacting financial institutions and their corporate clients found rising onboarding costs, lengthy onboarding times and sub-par ongoing maintenance of client records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Costs are spiralling, with resourcing and the need to hire more staff a major concern. It still takes too long to onboard customers, and the time taken to refresh client data is torturous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multinationals face further complications dealing with the UK’s risk-based approach, which allows more time to make decisions on threats and has no international standards to follow. As regulations can be interpreted differently, banks also often request inconsistent things from their clients, which results in inefficient operations of their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most common issues that IDnow hears from financial leaders responsible for supervising KYC and AML compliance within their organizations is the disconnect between their work and the business functions of the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making sense of the exponential amount of data and documentation required for KYC and AML checking can be tough and, due to complicated and inefficient processes, can halt processes such as onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watchdogs like the FCA say cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are only <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart/cryptoasset-investment-scams">magnifying the fraud problem,</a> despite the growing sector <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/65eb9636-d253-42af-8526-50d70c41a19b">working hard</a> to shake off its reputation as a haven for bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



 New school thinking&nbsp; 



<p>Ironically, the answer to avoiding ever-tougher controls, circumventing inflexible processes, and improving both standards and efficiencies in the KYC process may come from an unlikely source: the world of crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) must also keep detailed records of beneficiaries, complete further enhanced due diligence of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">politically exposed persons</a> (PEPs) and appoint an individual to oversee compliance and regulatory issues in the wider financial space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC is one of the biggest roadblocks that cryptocurrency firms face, especially given the nature of digital tokens to protect or shield the identity of the owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency firms have an opportunity to give regulators and customers confidence, outshine competition and demonstrate credibility by implementing industry-leading compliance practices.</p>Ben Luddington, Director at PwC UK.&nbsp; </blockquote>



<p>Unburdened by years of legacy system upgrades, bolt-ons and software changes, alternative finance companies have automated large swathes of the KYC process and built systems that can process a much wider source of data. This has created faster, safer and more robust paths to verification than in place at traditional banks and financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Configurability is essential to addressing the challenges faced by firms operating in multiple jurisdictions, but rigid technology stacks at many financial organizations jam up KYC compliance workflows. Indeed, every bank, insurance, accounting and law firms will likely have dusty rooms full of photocopied identity documents clogging up the filing archives of the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenger finance apps and crypto exchanges have also advanced the integration of Multi-Factor Authentication systems based on SCA (Strong Customer Authentication), Liveness checks, and other forms of biometric-based authentication. These types of identity verification processes, which sometimes require little more than a selfie and a PDF of a household bill, dramatically improve the customer’s onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p>



 How intelligent technology enhances the KYC process&nbsp; 



<p>Document verification determines if something is genuine or fake through a series of checks, but the quality of the process varies wildly. Field-to-field consistency, data validations and font anomaly detection, among others, are popular, but where smaller, nimbler services beat the larger incumbents is by combining the identity verification document check with biometrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These platforms have also made good use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esign/">electronic signatures</a> to communicate with their customers, further allowing them to promote additional financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smartest solutions have AI-based face and emotion recognition capabilities, or the ability to scan the internet for negative sentiment, making KYC procedures more cost-effective, accurate and customer-friendly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All firms must turn to technology to bolster KYC frameworks and accelerate the detection and mitigation of financial crime, Luddington said. This may be a build vs buy decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Deciding which processes will benefit from what technology requires considerable and careful thinking, but this will bear fruit in the long run,” he said. “We’re already seeing the FCA using analytics to innovate its regulatory approach and recognizing the importance of technology in driving financial crime compliance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk management has become more challenging over time as regulations tighten, and financial institutions have faced larger fines where compliance programs have failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Banks have long struggled to balance fraud prevention and customer service, and existing paper-based and risk-based processes are simply ill-suited to the demands of modern finance, while advanced, intelligent identity proofing developments are proving critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s more important than ever for financial services firms, particularly those in the UK, to understand the benefits of automation and apply them to the KYC process in order to truly manage fraud.</p>



<blockquote><p>Regulators should do more to create robust identity verification guidelines and set expectations that firms leverage better technology in order to stop the unwanted headlines about bank fraud.&nbsp;</p> Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>

<p>Recently, I came across an article titled “<a href="https://fcw.com/digital-government/2022/01/no-easy-fix-id-verification-government-benefits/361120/">No easy fix for ID verification for government benefits</a>” that explored a major challenge that governments have been facing for the past few years. This problem involves balancing fraud prevention in unemployment insurance claims and ensuring that qualified individuals can access the benefits that they are entitled to. The concern is that anti-fraud measures may prevent benefits from reaching the constituents that they are intended to help.</p>
<p>Since COVID-19 relief programs started in 2020, states have grappled with a dramatic increase in fraudulent claims. This led 27 state governments to work with a commercial identity verification provider in hopes of flagging potential fraud. Unfortunately, this resulted in a new issue that made the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/irs-to-back-off-third-party-facial-recognition-what-happens-to-id-me/">news</a> earlier this year called Identity Decisioning Bias. Identity Decisioning Bias was used in algorithms designed to verify identity but is built in a way that disadvantages certain populations, such as racial and gender groups. Depending on the identities that the AI algorithms were trained on, databases show bias towards certain populations. This means that some users might not be recognized and denied access to services.</p>
<p>What’s the solution to this problem? First, pooling data to build “intelligence” is risky because it leaves private data at risk of being hacked. Instead, data should be stored on a private, immutable blockchain to eliminate the possibility of theft. Additionally, live biometrics should be used for identity proofing instead of device level biometrics. The 1Kosmos BlockID platform can use mobile phones to perform a live selfie or a “liveness test” which can determine if the face in front of the camera is real or not with 99% accuracy. This eliminates the possibility of Identity Decisioning Bias in the 1Kosmos BlockID platform. Our platform was tested on iBeta to produce zero false matches in 200 live biometric attempts on iOS and Android devices, validating the reliability of the BlockID platform for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p>As the world continues to move to an online-first environment and begins to adopt zero-trust constructs at scale, we find we have architected a solution to suit the security needs of government and organizations today and well into the future.</p>

 SEC Head Honcho Gary Gensler Double Downs on Demand for Strong Crypto Regulations and Investor Protection <blockquote>Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chairman, rejected the notion that current securities law is incompatible with the crypto&nbsp;market.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC Supremo also asked crypto intermediaries such as crypto exchanges to register with them as securities exchanges and broker-dealers.</blockquote><blockquote>He also supported giving regulatory authority over the crypto industry to the CFTC when it comes to nonsecurity tokens.</blockquote><p>Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange (SEC), is yet again calling for crypto regulation.</p><p>A “vast majority” of crypto are securities issued to the public in violation of federal laws, he said at the Practicing Law Institute.</p><p>“These are not laundromat tokens. Promoters are marketing, and the investing public is buying most of these tokens, touting or anticipating profits based on the efforts of others,” highlighted Gensler.</p> Can Securities Law be Extended to Cryptocurrencies? <p>Many in the crypto industry have been calling for a new set of rules designed particularly for crypto assets due to existing securities law being unsuitable.Gensler completely rejected that notion saying, “Nothing about the crypto markets is incompatible with the securities laws.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1007303263807508482?s=20&amp;t=7qxQfl5whPN3H_T2dw_BjA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>It is important to point out here that the SEC officials, both current and former, have reiterated multiple times that most cryptocurrencies are actually securities, barring&nbsp;Bitcoin.</blockquote><p>Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, too, has been given a clean chit in the past. Still, the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, has denied giving any definitive statements on Ethereum’s status. So, the SEC’s stance toward Ethereum is unclear at the&nbsp;moment.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1567870504941281281">Image Source</a>)<p>However, a piece of news making rounds on crypto Twitter indicates that Gensler would love to back away from the previous SEC stance that Ethereum is a non-security but hasn’t found a credible way to pull this&nbsp;off.</p> Protecting Investors <p>The focus has been on protecting the investors, which is “just as relevant” in crypto “regardless of underlying technologies,” he added. According to him, investors need disclosure to “help them sort between the investments that they think will flourish and those that they think will flounder.”</p><p>The SEC chairman further called for crypto intermediaries like exchanges to be registered with the agency as securities exchanges and broker-dealers. On top of that, he wants crypto and stablecoin operators to “get their tokens registered and regulated.”</p><blockquote>Gensler concluded his remarks by quoting Joseph Kennedy, the first Chairman of the SEC, “<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-sec-speaks-090822">No honest business need fear the&nbsp;SEC</a>.”</blockquote><p>James Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, echoed Gensler’s sentiments, saying the sector needs to be “appropriately regulated” if it intends to play any role in the global financial system.</p> Sharing Power With the&nbsp;CFTC <p>At a separate event, Gensler signalled that he would support Congress handing more authority to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/us-senate-bill-proposes-to-make-cftc-the-go-to-regulator-for-bitcoin-ether-and-other-digital-commodities">the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a> greater power to oversee certain cryptocurrencies.</p><blockquote>Speaking at an industry conference, the Chairman said he looked forward to working with Congress to give the SEC’s sister markets regulator added power to oversee and regulate “non-security tokens…and the related intermediaries.”</blockquote><p>Gensler also said he is open to working with the lawmakers as long as they “don’t inadvertently undermine securities laws.”</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

             <p>This week, CEUR-WS.org has published the paper titled ‘<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3214/WS6Paper2.pdf">Harmonization Profiles for Trusted Data Sharing Between Data Spaces: Striking the Balance between Functionality and Complexity</a>’ in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Co-authored by INNOPAY’s <a href="https://www.innopay.com/en/employees/bauke-rietveld">Bauke Rietveld</a> and <a href="https://www.innopay.com/en/employees/vincent-jansen">Vincent Jansen</a> in collaboration with TNO, the paper explores what is required to enable interoperable data sharing between a wide variety of data spaces, in alignment with the EU Data Strategy. The paper was presented at the <a href="http://i-esa2022.webs.upv.es/index.htm">I-ESA 2022 conference</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>The ambition of the EU Data Strategy can be summarised as a ‘federation of interoperable data spaces’. Current data space implementations are already seen to have a wide range of architectures, frameworks and protocols. The Data Sharing Coalition and the NL AI Coalition Data Sharing Working Group have done considerable work to identify the concept of harmonisation profiles required for interoperability. Building upon this work, the paper presents a framework for structuring these harmonisation profiles.</p>

   ForgeRock introduces next-generation identity orchestration features to deliver superior digital identity experiences 

<p>ForgeRock announced today a major update to our industry leading identity orchestration capability, known as Intelligent Access Trees. This is a proud day for the ForgeRock team as we advance our vision around identity orchestration. Enterprises can now deliver great user experiences with much less effort. It's faster and easier for organizations to personalize customer and workforce journeys, deliver innovative experiences with no-code development, integrate identity into applications, and measure user engagement with the industry's first journey analytics dashboard.</p>

 Five New Capabilities Put Intelligent Access Trees in a Class of their Own 

<p>Our approach to identity orchestration is grounded in the belief that creating effortless digital experiences should be as natural as breathing. That's why it was natively built into our unified platform from the start. These 5 new capabilities help organizations take the user journey to the next level:</p>

  Dynamic and Contextual User Journeys Make Personalization a Breeze 
 <p>We've introduced the ability to enhance user journeys and make them "just right" for an individual without disrupting their experience or creating extra work for developers. It's easier than ever for organizations to change a person's user interface, language, and terms and conditions — or even offer a more accessible experience for someone with unique needs.</p>

  No-Code Drag-and-Drop Nodes Support Broad Use Cases 
 <p>Pre-built out-of-the-box nodes span a wide variety of use cases ranging from registration, social authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), A/B testing, and zero trust, to name a few. Plus, more than 150 additional third-party integrations are now available through the ForgeRock Trust Network. All of this adds up to faster out-of-the-box use case solutions, while reducing development and maintenance costs.</p>

  Infusing AI Directly into the Journey 
 <p>We've combined the best of Intelligent Access Trees and Autonomous Access. Our updated orchestration engine is infused with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered threat protection that can be leveraged with no-code drag-and-drop capabilities. By leveraging AI, organizations can optimize a journey to minimize friction and improve the user experience while protecting against account takeover and fraud. We are especially excited to share that we continue to focus on what's important: making it as easy as possible to use AI with the latest advanced enhancements.</p>

  Measure User Engagement with Journey Analytics 
 <p>The new journey analytics dashboard helps administrators measure and project trends for multiple parameters: total and engaged users, number of new sign-ups, and success and failure rates of individual user journeys across the identity lifecycle. These powerful analytics give organizations insights into how friction in user journeys affects the user experience.</p>

  Managing Journeys at Scale 
 <p>Organizations often house large libraries of journeys that are difficult and costly to manage. To lighten the burden, we've added features for testing and debugging, tagging, organizing, and searching journeys. These features vastly simplify processes for developers, and are particularly helpful when journeys are connected to a specific region, brand, or customer segment.</p>

 Natively Built Into Our Unified Platform 
<p>Our vision came into being with our 2018 release of Intelligent Access, a first-of-its-kind no-code/low-code identity orchestration capability that allows organizations to quickly and easily define personalized and secure user journeys across the identity lifecycle. Intelligent Access enables organizations to finely orchestrate every aspect of the user journey — from registration to password and profile self-service, to authentication and ongoing authorization. Because all these features are now native to our unified platform, organizations reap these benefits:</p>

  Reduced complexity: Development and administration from a single pane of glass means configuration of end-to-end flows does not require integration of disparate, bolted-on products which are administered separately. 
   Simpler, less risky policy creation: Policies for registration, authentication, and authorization are configured in one place to avoid inevitable "drift" that arises when security is configured in unintegrated systems. 
   Flexible user journey design: Context can be injected at exactly the proper point in the user journey, if needed. The user journey can dynamically respond to context and then adjust for less friction or more friction, in line with requirements. 
   Easier, faster updates and changes: Our SDKs are fully integrated and automatically reflect any changes to user journeys without the need to republish applications. Adding new MFA flow to journeys? No problem. There's no need for re-integration. 
   Minimized risk: Execution takes place inside the same runtime as the rest of our platform. This means all of the security, controls, service uptime, and performance characteristics are also unified. Organizations can take comfort in knowing that our proprietary, patented <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud/architecture">cloud security architecture</a> with full tenant isolation applies to all of our products equally, with nothing bolted on that could expose the organization to increased risk. 
   Streamlined management and operations: Built-in orchestration means there is only one product to manage from an operational and SLA perspective. Furthermore, it's available across the platform, whether you use our cloud service, self-managed software, or you're operating a hybrid environment. Troubleshooting and diagnosing issues does not require stitching together complex logs from different systems without the ability to trace transactions end to end. 
 <p>Native, built-in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/orchestration">orchestration</a> is a smart choice. Organizations benefit from lower risk and tremendous cost savings in development and ongoing operations and maintenance.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to seeing what our customers do with these new capabilities.</p>

  <p>One of the traditional approaches for communicating between <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2021/02/microservices/">microservices</a> is through their REST APIs. However, as your system evolves and the number of microservices grows, communication becomes more complex, and the architecture might start resembling our old friend the spaghetti anti-pattern, with services depending on each other or tightly coupled, slowing down development teams. This model can exhibit low latency but only works if services are made highly available.</p>

<p>To overcome this design disadvantage, new architectures aim to decouple senders from receivers, with asynchronous messaging. In a Kafka-centric architecture, low latency is preserved, with additional advantages like message balancing among available consumers and centralized management.</p>

<p>When dealing with a brownfield platform (legacy), a recommended way to decouple a monolith and ready it for a move to microservices is to implement asynchronous messaging.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to:</p>

 What is Kafka? 

<p>Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It was initially conceived as a message queue and open-sourced by LinkedIn in 2011. Its community evolved Kafka to provide key capabilities:</p>

 
   Publish and Subscribe to streams of records, like a message queue. 
   Storage system so messages can be consumed asynchronously. Kafka writes data to a scalable disk structure and replicates it for fault-tolerance. Producers can wait for write acknowledgments. 
   Stream processing with Kafka Streams API, enables complex aggregations or joins of input streams onto an output stream of processed data. 
 

<p>Traditional messaging models are queue and publish-subscribe. In a queue, each record goes to one consumer. In publish-subscribe, the record is received by all consumers.</p>

<p>The Consumer Group in Kafka is an abstraction that combines both models. Record processing can be load balanced among the members of a consumer group and Kafka allows you to broadcast messages to multiple consumer groups. It is the same publish-subscribe semantic where the subscriber is a cluster of consumers instead of a single process.</p>

<p>Popular use cases of Kafka include:</p>
 
   Traditional messaging, to decouple data producers from processors with better latency and scalability. 
   Site activity tracking with real-time publish-subscribe feeds. 
   As a replacement for file-based log aggregation, where event data becomes a stream of messages. 
   Data pipelines where data consumed from topics is transformed and fed to new topics. 
   As an external commit log for a distributed system. 
   As backend log storage for event sourcing applications, where each state change is logged in time order. 
 

 Microservices communication with Kafka 

<p>Let’s build a microservices architecture with JHipster and Kafka support. In this tutorial, you’ll create <code>store</code> and <code>alert</code> microservices. The store microservices will create and update store records. The <code>alert</code> microservice will receive update events from <code>store</code> and send an email alert.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prerequisites:</p>
   
     <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11+</a> 
     <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">Docker 20.10.17</a> 
     <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js 16.17.0</a> 
     <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI 0.10.0</a> 
   
</blockquote>

<p>Install JHipster.</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7.9.3
</code>   

<p>The <code>--version</code> command should output something like this:</p>

   <code>$ jhipster --version
INFO! Using bundled JHipster
7.9.3
</code>   

<p>Create a directory for the project.</p>

   <code>mkdir jhipster-kafka
cd jhipster-kafka
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>apps.jdl</code> file that defines the store, alert, and gateway applications in JHipster Domain Language (JDL). Kafka integration is enabled by adding <code>messageBroker kafka</code> to the store and alert app definitions.</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName gateway,
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway,
    applicationType gateway,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    prodDatabaseType postgresql,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka,
    testFrameworks [cypress]
  }
  entities Store, StoreAlert
}

application {
  config {
    baseName store,
    packageName com.okta.developer.store,
    applicationType microservice,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    databaseType mongodb,
    devDatabaseType mongodb,
    prodDatabaseType mongodb,
    enableHibernateCache false,
    serverPort 8082,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
    messageBroker kafka
  }
  entities Store
}

application {
  config {
    baseName alert,
    packageName com.okta.developer.alert,
    applicationType microservice,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    serverPort 8082,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
    messageBroker kafka
  }
  entities StoreAlert
}

enum StoreStatus {
  OPEN,
  CLOSED
}

entity Store {
  name String required,
  address String required,
  status StoreStatus,
  createTimestamp Instant required,
  updateTimestamp Instant
}

entity StoreAlert {
  storeName String required,
  storeStatus String required,
  timestamp Instant required
}

microservice Store with store
microservice StoreAlert with alert
</code>   

<p>Now, in your <code>jhipster-kafka</code> folder, import this file with the following command:</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl apps.jdl
</code>   

 Configure microservices deployment with Docker Compose 

<p>In the project folder, create a sub-folder for Docker Compose and run JHipster’s <code>docker-compose</code> sub-generator.</p>

   <code>mkdir docker-compose
cd docker-compose
jhipster docker-compose
</code>   

<p>The generator will ask you to define the following things:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Type of gateway: JHipster gateway based on Spring Cloud Gateway 
   Leave the root directory for services as default: ../ 
   Which applications to include: gateway, store, alert 
   Which applications do you want to use with clustered databases: (none) 
   If monitoring should be enabled: No 
   Password for JHipster Registry: <code>&lt;default&gt;</code> 
 

<p>Almost when the generator completes, a warning shows in the output:</p>

   <code>WARNING! Docker Compose configuration generated, but no Jib cache found
If you forgot to generate the Docker image for this application, please run:
To generate the missing Docker image(s), please run:
 ./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild in /home/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka/alert
 ./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild in /home/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka/gateway
 ./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild in /home/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka/store
</code>   

<p>You will generate the images later, but first, let’s add some security and Kafka integration to your microservices.</p>

 Add OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication 

<p>This microservices architecture is set up to authenticate against Keycloak. Let’s update the settings to use Okta as the authentication provider.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Then, change the Redirect URIs to:</p>
   <code>http://localhost:8081/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc
</code>   
<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:8761</code> for the Logout Redirect URIs.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct (see above, below are the default values) redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>In the project, create a <code>docker-compose/.env</code> file and add the following variables. For the values, use the settings from the Okta web application you created:</p>

   <code>OIDC_ISSUER_URI={yourIssuer}
OIDC_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and update the <code>SPRING_SECURITY_*</code> settings for the services <code>store-app</code>, <code>alert-app</code>, <code>gateway-app</code>, and <code>jhipster-registry</code>:</p>

   <code>- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=${OIDC_ISSUER_URI}
- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=${OIDC_CLIENT_ID}
- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=${OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}
</code>   

 Use Spring Cloud Config to override OIDC settings 

<p>An alternative to setting environment variables for each application in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> is to use Spring Cloud Config. JHipster Registry includes Spring Cloud Config, so it’s pretty easy to do.</p>

<p>Open <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> and add your Okta settings there.</p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: /oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: {yourClientId}
            client-secret: {yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>The registry, gateway, store, and alert applications are all configured to read this configuration on startup.</p>

 Communicate between store and alert microservices 

<p>The JHipster generator adds a <code>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</code> dependency to applications that declare <code>messageBroker kafka</code> (in JDL), enabling the Spring Cloud Stream <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_main_concepts">programming model</a> with the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka.html#_usage_examples">Apache Kafka binder</a> for using Kafka as the messaging middleware.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud Stream was recently added back to JHipster. Now, instead of working with Kafka Core APIs, we can use the binder abstraction, declaring input/output arguments in the code, and letting the specific binder implementation handle the mapping to the broker destination.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: At this moment, JHipster includes Spring Cloud Stream 3.2.4, which has <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-preface-notable-deprecations">deprecated</a> the annotation-based programming model, <code>@EnableBinding</code> and <code>@StreamListener</code> annotations, in favor of the functional programming model. Stay tuned for future JHipster updates.</p>

<p>For the sake of this example, update the <code>store</code> microservice to send a message to the <code>alert</code> microservice through Kafka, whenever a store entity is updated.</p>

<p>First, create an outbound binding for a new topic <code>store-alerts</code>. Add the interface <code>KafkaStoreAlertProducer</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.config;

import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.Output;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;

public interface KafkaStoreAlertProducer {
    String CHANNELNAME = "binding-out-store-alert";

    @Output(CHANNELNAME)
    MessageChannel output();
}
</code>   
<p>Include the outbound binding in the <code>WebConfigurer</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.config;

@EnableBinding({ KafkaSseConsumer.class, KafkaSseProducer.class, KafkaStoreAlertProducer.class })
@Configuration
public class WebConfigurer implements ServletContextInitializer {
...
</code>   

<p>Add the binding configuration to <code>application.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      ...
      bindings:
        ...
        binding-out-store-alert:
          destination: store-alerts-topic
          content-type: application/json
          group: store-alerts
</code>   

<p>In the <code>store</code> project, create an <code>AlertService</code> for sending the event details.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.service;

import com.okta.developer.store.config.KafkaStoreAlertProducer;
import com.okta.developer.store.domain.Store;
import com.okta.developer.store.service.dto.StoreAlertDTO;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageHeaders;
import org.springframework.messaging.support.GenericMessage;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.util.MimeTypeUtils;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Service
public class AlertService {

    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AlertService.class);

    private final MessageChannel output;

    public AlertService(@Qualifier(KafkaStoreAlertProducer.CHANNELNAME) MessageChannel output) {
        this.output = output;
    }

    public void alertStoreStatus(Store store) {
        try {
            StoreAlertDTO storeAlertDTO = new StoreAlertDTO(store);
            log.debug("Request the message : {} to send to store-alert topic ", storeAlertDTO);

            Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
            map.put(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, MimeTypeUtils.APPLICATION_JSON);
            MessageHeaders headers = new MessageHeaders(map);
            output.send(new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;(storeAlertDTO, headers));
        } catch (Exception e){
            log.error("Could not send store alert", e);
            throw new AlertServiceException(e);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the referenced <code>AlertServiceException</code> class.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.service;

public class AlertServiceException extends RuntimeException {

    public AlertServiceException(Throwable e) {
        super(e);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>And add a <code>StoreAlertDTO</code> class in the <code>...service.dto</code> package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.service.dto;

import com.okta.developer.store.domain.Store;

public class StoreAlertDTO {

    private String storeName;
    private String storeStatus;

    public StoreAlertDTO(Store store){
        this.storeName = store.getName();
        this.storeStatus = store.getStatus().name();
    }

    public String getStoreName() {
        return storeName;
    }

    public void setStoreName(String storeName) {
        this.storeName = storeName;
    }

    public String getStoreStatus() {
        return storeStatus;
    }

    public void setStoreStatus(String storeStatus) {
        this.storeStatus = storeStatus;
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Inject the <code>AlertService</code> into the <code>StoreResource</code> API implementation, modifying its constructor. Also modify the <code>updateStore</code> call to publish a <code>StoreAlertDTO</code> for the <code>alert</code> service:</p>

   <code>@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class StoreResource {

    ...
    private final StoreRepository storeRepository;
    private final AlertService alertService;

    public StoreResource(StoreRepository storeRepository, AlertService alertService) {
        this.storeRepository = storeRepository;
        this.alertService = alertService;
    }

    ...

    @PutMapping("/stores/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity&lt;Store&gt; updateStore(
        @PathVariable(value = "id", required = false) final String id,
        @Valid @RequestBody Store store
    ) throws URISyntaxException {
        ...

        Store result = storeRepository.save(store);

        log.debug("SEND store alert for Store: {}", store);
        alertService.alertStoreStatus(result);

        ...
    }

   ...
}
</code>   

 Enable debug logging in production 

<p>Since you are going to deploy the <code>prod</code> profile, let’s enable logging in production. Modify the <code>store/src/main/java/com/okta/.../config/LoggingAspectConfiguration.java</code> class:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class LoggingAspectConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @Profile({JHipsterConstants.SPRING_PROFILE_DEVELOPMENT, JHipsterConstants.SPRING_PROFILE_PRODUCTION})
    public LoggingAspect loggingAspect(Environment env) {
        return new LoggingAspect(env);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>store/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> and change the log level to <code>DEBUG</code> for the store application:</p>

   <code>logging:
  level:
    ROOT: INFO
    tech.jhipster: INFO
    com.okta.developer.store: DEBUG
</code>   

 Add an <code>EmailService</code> to the alert microservice 

<p>Now let’s customize the <code>alert</code> microservice. First, add the consumer declaration <code>KafkaStoreAlertConsumer</code> to the config:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.config;

import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.Input;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;

public interface KafkaStoreAlertConsumer {
    String CHANNELNAME = "binding-in-store-alert";

    @Input(CHANNELNAME)
    MessageChannel input();
}
</code>   
<p>Include the binding in the <code>WebConfigurer</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.config;

@EnableBinding({ KafkaSseConsumer.class, KafkaSseProducer.class, KafkaStoreAlertConsumer.class })
@Configuration
public class WebConfigurer implements ServletContextInitializer {
...
</code>   

<p>Add the inbound binding configuration to <code>application.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      bindings:
        ...
        binding-in-store-alert:
          destination: store-alerts-topic
          content-type: application/json
          group: store-alerts
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>EmailService</code> to send the store update notification, using the Spring Framework’s <code>JavaMailSender</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service;

import com.okta.developer.alert.service.dto.StoreAlertDTO;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.mail.SimpleMailMessage;
import org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSender;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmailService {

    private JavaMailSender emailSender;

    @Value("${alert.distribution-list}")
    private String distributionList;

    public EmailService(JavaMailSender emailSender){
        this.emailSender = emailSender;
    }

    public void sendSimpleMessage(StoreAlertDTO alertDTO){
        try {
            SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
            message.setTo(distributionList);
            message.setSubject("Store Alert: " + alertDTO.getStoreName());
            message.setText(alertDTO.getStoreStatus());
            message.setFrom("StoreAlert");
            emailSender.send(message);
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            throw new EmailServiceException(exception);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the referenced <code>EmailServiceException</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service;

public class EmailServiceException extends RuntimeException {

    public EmailServiceException(Exception exception) {
        super(exception);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>StoreAlertDTO</code> class in the <code>...service.dto</code> package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service.dto;

public class StoreAlertDTO {

    private String storeName;
    private String storeStatus;

    public String getStoreName() {
        return storeName;
    }

    public void setStoreName(String storeName) {
        this.storeName = storeName;
    }

    public String getStoreStatus() {
        return storeStatus;
    }

    public void setStoreStatus(String storeStatus) {
        this.storeStatus = storeStatus;
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Add a new property to <code>alert/src/main/resources/config/application.yml</code> and to <code>alert/src/test/resources/config/application.yml</code> for the destination email of the store alert.</p>

   <code>alert:
  distribution-list: {distributionListAddress}
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You’ll need to set a value for the email (e.g. <code>list@email.com</code> will work) in <code>src/test/.../application.yml</code> for tests to pass. For Docker, you’ll override the <code>{distributionListAddress}</code> and <code>{username}</code> + <code>{password}</code> placeholder values with environment variables below.</p>

<p>Update <code>spring.mail.*</code> properties in <code>application-prod.yml</code> to set Gmail as the email service:</p>

   <code>spring:
  ...
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: {username}
    protocol: smtp
    tls: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
</code>   

 Add a Kafka consumer to persist alert and send email 

<p>Create an <code>AlertConsumer</code> service to persist a <code>StoreAlert</code> and send the email notification when receiving an alert message through Kafka. Add <code>KafkaProperties</code>, <code>StoreAlertRepository</code>, and <code>EmailService</code> as constructor arguments. Then add a <code>start()</code> method to initialize the consumer and enter the processing loop.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service;

import com.okta.developer.alert.config.KafkaStoreAlertConsumer;
import com.okta.developer.alert.domain.StoreAlert;
import com.okta.developer.alert.repository.StoreAlertRepository;
import com.okta.developer.alert.service.dto.StoreAlertDTO;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.StreamListener;
import org.springframework.messaging.Message;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.time.Instant;
@Service
public class AlertConsumer {

    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AlertConsumer.class);

    private StoreAlertRepository storeAlertRepository;

    private EmailService emailService;

    public AlertConsumer(StoreAlertRepository storeAlertRepository, EmailService emailService) {
        this.storeAlertRepository = storeAlertRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }

    @StreamListener(value = KafkaStoreAlertConsumer.CHANNELNAME, copyHeaders = "false")
    public void consume(Message&lt;StoreAlertDTO&gt; message) {
        StoreAlertDTO dto = message.getPayload();
        log.info("Got message from kafka stream: {} {}", dto.getStoreName(), dto.getStoreStatus());
        try {
            StoreAlert storeAlert = new StoreAlert();
            storeAlert.setStoreName(dto.getStoreName());
            storeAlert.setStoreStatus(dto.getStoreStatus());
            storeAlert.setTimestamp(Instant.now());

            storeAlertRepository.save(storeAlert);
            emailService.sendSimpleMessage(dto);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            log.error(e.getMessage(), e);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>NOTE: Any unhandled exception during message processing will make the service leave the consumer group. That’s why there’s code above that catches <code>Exception</code>.</p>

<p>As a last customization step, update the logging configuration the same way you did for the <code>store</code> microservice.</p>

 Microservices + Kafka container deployment 

<p>Modify <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and add the following environment variables for the <code>alert</code> application:</p>

   <code>- SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=${MAIL_USERNAME}
- SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=${MAIL_PASSWORD}
- ALERT_DISTRIBUTION_LIST=${DISTRIBUTION_LIST}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/.env</code> and add values for the new environment variables:</p>

   <code>MAIL_USERNAME={yourGmailAccount}
MAIL_PASSWORD={yourPassword}
DISTRIBUTION_LIST={anotherEmailAccount}
</code>   

<p>Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then generate the Docker image for the <code>store</code> microservice. Run the following command from the <code>store</code> directory.</p>

   <code>./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
# `npm run java:docker` is a shortcut for the above command
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you’re using Apple Silicon, you’ll need to use <code>npm run java:docker:arm64</code>.</p>

<p>Repeat for the <code>alert</code> and <code>gateway</code> apps.</p>

  <p>Before you run your microservices architecture, make sure you have enough RAM allocated. Docker Desktop’s default is 2GB, I recommend 8GB. This setting is under Docker &gt; Resources &gt; Advanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, run everything using Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker-compose
docker compose up
</code>   

<p>You will see a huge amount of logging while each service starts. Wait a minute or two, then open <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and log in with your Okta account. This is the JHipster Registry which you can use to monitor your apps’ statuses. Wait for all the services to be up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open a new terminal window and tail the <code>alert</code> microservice logs to verify it’s processing <code>StoreAlert</code> records:</p>

   <code>docker logs -f docker-compose-alert-1 | grep Consumer
</code>   

<p>You should see log entries indicating the consumer group to which the <code>alert</code> microservice joined on startup:</p>

</code>   

<p>Once everything is up, go to the gateway at <code>http://localhost:8081</code> and log in. Create a store entity and then update it. The <code>alert</code> microservice should log entries when processing the received message from the <code>store</code> service.</p>

</code>   

<p>If you see a <code>MailAuthenticationException</code> in the <code>alert</code> microservices log when attempting to send the notification, it might be your Gmail security configuration.</p>

   <code>alert-app_1           | org.springframework.mail.MailAuthenticationException: Authentication failed; nested exception is javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at

</code>   

<p>To enable the login from the <code>alert</code> application, go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">https://myaccount.google.com</a> and then choose the Security tab. Turn on 2-Step Verification for your account. In the section Signing in to Google, choose App passwords and create a new <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833">app password</a>. In the Select app dropdown set Other (Custom name) and type the name for this password. Click Generate and copy the password. Update <code>docker-compose/.env</code> and set the app password for Gmail authentication.</p>

   <code>MAIL_PASSWORD={yourAppPassword}
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT: Don’t forget to delete the app password once the test is done.</p>

<p>Stop all the containers with CTRL+C and restart again with <code>docker compose up</code>.
Update a store again and you should receive an email with the store’s status this time.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, authentication (of producers and consumers), authorization (of read/write operations), and encryption (of data) were not covered, as security in Kafka is optional. See <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security">Kafka’s documentation on security</a> to learn how to enable these features.</p>

				  Trust Registries Tweetstorm 
<p>Darrell’s tweetstorm over the weekend has been getting a lot of attention (<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1569093372920614914.html">Threadreader unroll here)</a>. We want to start a conversation on <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> and get people thinking about how Trust Registries will help answer the hard questions an ecosystem needs to create a whole experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He points out the easy questions we already know to ask:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>Where do the systems you want to work with go to get the answers to questions like

How do I know can trust

- this Issuer for that Credential?
- trust that Verifier?
- that Wallet App?

				 However, there is much more to explore – many other questions are just as essential. We are starting the v2.0 of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a> over at the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a> to further investigate some of these questions.<p></p>
<p>A few things to mull over are below:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>questions like...

What credential formats does the ecosystem define?

-- NO - there is no interoperable standard for real-world use of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VerifiableCredentials?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VerifiableCredentials</a>, so you can't say, "just use W3C Verifiable Credentials".

				 <blockquote>
<p>How do you do delegation in your ecosystem? Is it baked into your DID Method?

How does someone confirm delegation is still valid (revocation may help - it may not)?

				 <blockquote>
<p>How do you support revocation in your ecosystem - if you need it?

most don't - do your homework on that one - i.e. not more later.

				 <p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a> will discuss the questions above at the end of this month. We are starting the Trust Registry Protocol Specification next week, and you are welcome to join us at the Task Force meeting.

<p>Ecosystems are evolving – quickly, and it‘s time to start thinking about how we will manage trust and reputation and how Trust Registries help to anchor the confidence we need in our systems.</p>

<p>The Department of State’s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP) is sponsoring a training series to counter malware created by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The nine-day training program will be offered to six partner nations from Africa, Asia, and the western hemisphere, predominantly targeting employees and their public sector equivalent from security incident response teams. Increased training for cybersecurity across the globe is a key part of the US commitment to promoting a stable and reliable internet for all. In recent years malicious cyber activities by the DPRK have increasingly threatened the integrity and stability of the global financial systems, <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA5MDcuNjMzNTk2MTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLWNlcnQuY2lzYS5nb3YvbmNhcy9hbGVydHMvYWEyMC0yMzlhIn0.M6wyfUs5gjZ0zycBPrxoefXP6VQKXRnJlUZWxaAoOdE%2Fs%2F1436012980%2Fbr%2F143636521009-l&amp;data=05%7C01%7CSimmonsJX%40state.gov%7Cb3d65a3d286040f5242d08da910699b1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637981754784879132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wwhcgMgpmfPRnPZ3%2FocV537bJCS9uAi4HAoZW86RpL0%3D&amp;reserved=0">even stealing directly from banks.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/patreon-lays-off-its-entire-security-team">Patreon Lays Off Its Entire Security Team</a></p>
<p>This is probably the biggest news in the security space this week, and it has been covered by several news outlets. Here, we have a brief summary by Nathaniel Mott, a contributing writer to PCmag. While some believe this to be a particularly bold move, Patreon claims that this will in no way impact their ability to provide a secure platform and that they have partnered with a number of external organizations to continue to develop their security abilities. Security is an extremely important aspect of any business or product, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ%C2%A0">can be very costly when it goes wrong.</a> One great aspect of verifiable credentials that Indicio is always stressing is their ability to tie into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RQ3-YHaVE&amp;list=PL3LvHy3eIPsmb-mFf_kZickFs51T1hGzq&amp;index=2">Zero Trust</a> and your security stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/security-awareness-training-must-evolve-to-align-with-growing-e-commerce-security-threats">Security Awareness Training Must Evolve to Align With Growing E-Commerce Security Threats</a></p>
<p>Digital transformation is creating new security headaches for e-commerce, says Bruno Farinelli, a Fraud Analytics Manager for ClearSale. He points to shipping fraud, email phishing attacks, and ransomware and malware that exploit hybrid and remote workforce trends as the major trends. Citing TransUnion’s “<a href="https://content.transunion.com/v/2022-global-digital-fraud-trends-report">2022 Global Digital Fraud Trends</a>” Farinelli points out that shipping fraud has skyrocketed year-on-year since 2019, with package- rerouting scams exploiting good customer service practices. Similarly, business email compromise is a growing problem, with hackers pretending to be trusted suppliers or vendors. In this fascinating article, Farinelli argues that e-commerce businesses need to see employee security awareness as a process rather than a one-off training, as the points of attack and the means of defrauding business are constantly evolving. While this is ideal, it is unrealistic to expect employees to maintain sufficient security vigilance to defeat fraud. The reality is that all these problems can be solved with verifiable credentials that provide the kind of reliable authentication within a Zero-Trust framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/cyber-insecurity-healthcare/">‘Cyber insecurity’ in healthcare is leading to increased patient mortality rates</a></p>
<p>Esther Shein, a freelance writer for TechRepublic, summarizes a <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/threat-reports/pfpt-us-tr-cyber-insecurity-healthcare-ponemon-report.pdf">recent report</a> that found ransomware attacks are actively delaying procedures and tests, leading to increased complications and worse patient outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article breaks down statistics from the report, some of the most staggering being:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The study surveyed 641 healthcare IT and security practitioners, and more than 20% of organizations that experienced the most common types of attacks (cloud compromise, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ransomware-cheat-sheet-everything-you-need-to-know/">ransomware</a>, supply chain and business email compromise) saw increased patient mortality rates. 
 Healthcare organizations have an average of more than 26,000 network-connected devices, only 51% include them in their cybersecurity strategy. 
 Ransomware attacks are most likely to have a negative impact on patient care, leading to delays in procedures or tests in 64% of the organizations. 
 Only 59% address employees’ lack of awareness, with 63% conducting regular training and awareness programs and 59% resorting to monitoring employee actions. 
 
<p>Shein says that training and awareness programs are the top two defenses for healthcare providers, but lack of funding and resources is a consistent hurdle for security teams. The article leaves us with Ryan Witt, healthcare cybersecurity leader at Proofpoint, weighing in on the state of cybersecurity in healthcare – “Healthcare has traditionally fallen behind other sectors in addressing vulnerabilities to the growing number of cybersecurity attacks, and this inaction has a direct negative impact on patients’ safety and wellbeing… as long as cybersecurity remains a low priority, healthcare providers will continue to endanger their patients.”</p>

<p>As you can see from the above articles good training is important for both the organization and the employees that help make it successful. For those of you interested in training your own teams in decentralized identity, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the workshops offered by Indicio. <a href="https://indicio.tech/new-indicio-executive-workshop-provides-essential-grounding-in-digital-identity-the-business-and-investors-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity/">The Business and Investor’s Guide to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> is a great place to start for leadership or investors looking to understand the technology and be able to talk through their ideas with an industry expert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Signing documents involves a lot of effort in the office: documents travel back and forth between departments, must be printed out and copied. If the parties involved are also in different locations and for example suppliers are involved, the process of signing becomes even more time-consuming and complicated. For a long time, this posed challenges for those involved in the circular economy. <br>Thanks to the cooperation of <a href="http://www.wandrei.de">Dr. Ing. Wandrei</a>, <a href="https://authada.de/en/">AUTHADA</a> and <a href="https://infocert.digital/solutions/digital-transaction-and-approval/">InfoCert</a>, this process has been optimised and an important milestone in the digitalisation of the circular economy has been achieved for all parties involved.</p>



<p>Since 2010, according to the electronic waste records procedure (eANV), actors in the circular economy in Germany such as carriers and disposers have already been obliged to sign disposal records and consignment notes digitally and by means of a remote signature, the Qualified Electronic Signature (QES). Until now, however, this was only possible in a roundabout way – with card readers. A procedure that no longer reflected the actual processes and necessities in an up-to-date manner. </p>



<p>Dr. Ing. Wandrei, a Berlin software company with 30 years old experience with software solutions characterised by cloud capability, platform-independent standards and a range of interfaces, took on this problem and looked for partners with whom it could further develop and optimise a mobile solution for NSUITE for the electronic waste records procedure (eANV) and expand it to include a hardware-independent QES.</p>



<p>The sticking point during the search was that most signature service providers only offered the possibility to sign Word or PDF documents via remote signature. AUTHADA and InfoCert provides a solution where documents could be signed in the prescribed XML format, becoming two perfect partners for Dr. Ing. Wandrei</p>



 Uncomplicated and fast with new technology 



<p>Thanks to the technology from AUTHADA and InfoCert implemented in NSUITE, the signature process in the circular economy is now faster and more streamlined. Drivers no longer have to carry signature cards and expensive hardware, go to the office or call an employee from the office. Instead, the signature can now be done on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets with the new NSUITE.mobile product, with a consequent streamlining of the entire process.</p>

Dock’s Web3 ID complements Auth0 extensible identity, and the ease in which customers can seamlessly integrate adjacent technologies to facilitate the successful execution of larger projects such as digital transformation, threat detection, compliance, and customer conversion. </p><p>Web3 introduced the ability to sign in using cryptocurrency wallets. But with crypto wallets, all the user data that a developer can request and verify has to be publicly available on the blockchain. Dock's Web3 ID gives developers the ability to verify private user data. With this integration, Dock brings decentralization, ownership of their identifiers, and the ability to privately sign in to apps and services to Auth0 customers.</p><p>“Dock Web3 ID was built to provide all the convenience of OAuth style login while also ensuring that individuals don’t leak their data, and remain in control of their login credentials at all times. Working with the industry-leading customer identity platform, Auth0, is a key aspect of Dock’s growth strategy as their reach amongst development teams is extensive and we anticipate this collaboration paving the way for Dock Web3 ID to be used at scale.” said Nick Lambert, Dock’s CEO.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/">Auth0 Marketplace</a>. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0, a product unit within Okta. “After speaking with many customers, we have identified the types of integrations that matter to them, and we are so thrilled to have Dock’s Web3 ID as a vetted and valuable vendor in Auth0 Marketplace.” </p><p>Auth0 reviews partner integration functionality, and makes available integrations that are easy to discover and integrate for customers. Partners can participate in the growing demand for digital identity solutions and increase their visibility as part of Auth0 Marketplace, and can learn more here: <a href="https://auth0.com/partners">https://auth0.com/partners</a>.</p><p>About Dock</p><p>Dock brings decentralization, ownership of digital identifiers and privacy-preserving user verification to identity management. Dock's Decentralized Identity Platform provides a highly secure and scalable solution for businesses and developers to issue and verify digital identity credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology.

The project aims to deliver the foundation to scrape most of the websites around the globe by developing a tool to extract data from various sites for further processing. The solution will minimize the programming knowledge that developers need to have to extract data from multiple sites in parallel.</p><p>This kind of data will provide access to powerful insights from the market. For instance, the tool can be used to collect daily inputs from a real estate agency, extract all product data from competitors in one go, including full pricing/product description, category, and brand information and the data can be plotted to discover new trends and create reports. Directimo will support all users in bootstrapping their projects and finding solutions for specific use&nbsp;cases.</p><blockquote>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem &amp; Partnerships, Ocean Protocol&nbsp;said:</blockquote><blockquote>“The data parsing tools directimo are building are a great match for Ocean Shipyard. We are particularly excited because Directimo tools will be available to the entire Ocean community and will dramatically help onboard quality data onto&nbsp;Ocean.”</blockquote><blockquote>Alexandru Dan, CTO of Directimo further commented:</blockquote><blockquote>“Web scrapers automatically collect information and data that are usually only accessible by visiting a website in a browser. By doing this autonomously, web scraping scripts open up a world of possibilities in data mining, data analysis, statistical analysis and much more. Everyone with some basic computer knowledge will be able to clone the open source project and start a journey into web parsing and data aggregation in order to collect meaningful information from the&nbsp;web.”</blockquote><p>The project will employ advanced technologies including Python, Redis and Kafka to create a distributed on-demand scraping cluster. The goal is to distribute URLs among many waiting spyder instances, whose requests are coordinated via&nbsp;Redis.</p><p>The benefit of using a distributed system is that it will enable communication between spyders and generate flows. If a user wants to obtain the title from a paginated list, they will be able to use 2 spyders: one to open each page and one to instruct the other spyder to take the titles. Using Kafka Directimo will also allow the system to track the status of each request and trigger them if the configuration is&nbsp;faulty.</p><p>The goal is to create customizable spyders, allow users to write their own and eventually pave the way for future orchestration. All required data will be exported to a database in order to create specific reports for the users. The goal is to leverage this to further facilitate a real-estate model that’s scalable on a global level and a platform that integrates marketing tools for 4x superior conversions, lead nurturing and buyer advisory services.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Applications for the next wave of Shipyard contenders are opening on September 15.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today, we’ll talk about digital money, especially a type of digital money that I see that not many people are discussing today. Except, of course, our special guest who is David G. W. Birch. He is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services, Principal at 15 Mb, his advisory company. He is Global Ambassador for the secure electronic transaction’s consultancy, Consult Hyperion. He is Fintech Ambassador for Digital Jersey and Non-Executive Chair at DIGISEQ Limited. He is an internationally recognised thought leader in digital identity and digital money. Also, author of several books including his latest book, The Currency Cold War: Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates, and Hegemony. Hello, David.</p>
<p>David Birch: Hello, Oscar. Thank you so much for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure talking with you and super interesting topic we’re going to discuss today about digital money. So yeah, let’s start a conversation. Let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to hear first, a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>David: Oh, sure. OK. Well, my background originally was in secure communications, and originally for military and government purposes. And then, of course, in the ’80s, that became part in the financial services sector was developing a networking and suddenly those skills were needed in financial services. And then I began to specialise in the area of payments, which are very, very interesting to me.</p>
<p>But after a while, I began to realise that a lot of the problems that we were facing in the payment sector, things like fraud and so on, were really not payment problems, they were really identity problems. And so, I became very fascinated by the world of digital identity, and how to, if you like, re-imagine identity for an online and interconnected world. And so that’s how I came to originally edit a book. And then I came to write a book about it.</p>
<p>And as time goes on, I’ve become… well, I’ve become more convinced than ever, that digital identity is the fundamental enabler for all sorts of new business, new ways of working and new society, but also a fundamental problem, because we don’t seem to have been able to fix it. And we all still struggle with passwords and logging on and scamming and fraud and all sorts of things. So yeah, so I began to realise that digital identity was really the fundamental problem needed to be solved. And then I became very interested in how to solve it in different ways.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, super interesting. And as you said, there are problems that are dragging for many years already and we’re still dealing with those. But you are working with the very latest, as I said earlier, not many people here, what we’re going to discuss today, particularly in about digital money, there is a type called CBDCs digital currencies. So, could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>David: People are very familiar with cryptocurrencies. And there’s lots of fun and interesting things happening in the world of cryptocurrencies. I mean, there’s also lots of crazy things happening and lots of and lots of criminal things happening. But nonetheless, the technology is very interesting. But cryptocurrencies are valued by the market. They have no inherent value. There’s– A Bitcoin is worth what people will pay for a Bitcoin. It’s not backed by anything.</p>
<p>A digital currency is something that’s backed by something. So, for example, you could have a digital currency like the circle, you know, USDC, where you have cryptographic tokens, but they’re redeemable for one US dollar. You could have tokens that are backed by commodities, like oil or gold or something like that. Or you could have tokens that are backed by goods and services, or future products and services, all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But in my very nerdish distinction, cryptocurrencies are backed by supply and demand, only. Whereas digital currencies are backed by something that has value, which might be another currency, it might be a commodity, it might be a company, or you know, whatever. Now, within that world of digital currencies, lots of central banks around the world are starting to think, “Well, we want our citizens to have access to new innovation, new ways of doing things, better ways of doing business. So perhaps we should look at making digital versions of our currencies.” And these are what people call digital fiat, because central bank currencies are what is called fiat currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies, CBDCs. I’ll use that latter word, because that’s what people– I mean, I know it’s longer, but that’s what people have come to use.</p>
<p>So, when we’re talking about Central Bank Digital Currencies, we’re talking about using some of the technologies of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets and decentralised finance and all that kind of thing. But we’re using them to transport these tokens which are backed by something else. And if you think about it, I mean the reason why lots of people want to do that is because it can be much more efficient to trade values across distributed ledgers in a decentralised manner, using decentralised finance protocols. You can easily see why this is.</p>
<p>Because after all, if let’s say, you buy a share in Apple from me, for you to get that share in Apple involves all sorts of third parties in different layers, you have brokers and dealers and market makers and front office and back office, and middle office, settlement and reconciliation, clearing, you know, you have lots of things that have to happen. But if I send you a token, that’s worth one share in Apple, it just goes from my wallet to your wallet. So, the financial services people, the serious financial services people are very interested in this because it’s a much more cost-effective way of doing business, not because of they have any ideological commitments but because it’s a lower cost way of doing business.</p>
<p>So Central Bank Digital Currencies exist in that world. And you know, the idea that you and I might trade through some protocols, in some sort of decentralised finance market, and I send you my token that represents an Apple share, and you send me some tokens that represent dollars. That’s not crazy. That’s where I think we’re going. And I think that’s what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, seeing as a token, something simple one– something simple that can be, as you said, given directly from one person to another, it simplifies a lot what– how things are doing today, as you say, with the example of buying– you sell me, for instance, an Apple share, indeed. How does that token goes from you to me? For instance, I read one of your articles and you mentioned that it has to be offline, or not, it’s like device to device, or that’s known as…</p>
<p>David: Yes. So, this is– that’s a slightly different argument. So, if we say, well, OK, a Central Bank Digital Currency is a good thing. It would be nice if we had tokens that were pounds or dollars, pesos that we could exchange with each other. That’s good. But actually, if a central bank is going to provide those, and it’s going to provide them for all its citizens, not just some people that have nice computers and high-speed broadband, if it’s going to provide those for all of its citizens as a potential alternative to cash, then it has to satisfy some additional criteria. And in particular, it has to be able to work where there are no networks.</p>
<p>So, if you and I – I mean I always take a simple example, which is car parking. If I go to the underground car park, I want my car to be able to use digital currency to pay for its parking place. But in the underground car park, there’s no mobile signal. So, it’s annoying, when you try to use apps and things like that. A digital currency that’s going to be a cash alternative has to be able to function in a device-to-device mode, when there’s no mobile network, no internet, possibly even no electricity.</p>
<p>I should be able to transfer money from my phone to a merchant’s phone so that I can buy some milk, even when there are no networks, perhaps because of there’s a natural disaster or power failures or so on. Because otherwise, you’re not really providing a real alternative to cash. If it’s a real alternative to cash, it has to work everywhere all the time. And this means it has to operate in a device-to-device mode, so that I can send money from my USB stick to your phone, like direct by NFC or tapping them or I mean, whatever, you know.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it has to work with or without internet, as you said, right? Be the replacement of cash.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And to also clarify, because many people have been, not only talking but also buying and selling cryptocurrencies, well until very recently, but yeah, it’s a term that has been used a lot in the last year. People get more familiar, maybe not everybody understand it but yeah, we have an idea what is a cryptocurrency. What are the main differences? You already mentioned a bit, but let’s say the top differences between cryptocurrency like the Bitcoin and the CBDC.</p>
<p>David: Well, like I said, cryptocurrencies don’t have anything behind them. They’re only valuable according to what people will pay for them. Their value is set by supply and demand. But digital currencies have a backing. And in the case of Central Bank Digital Currencies, that’s central bank money. So, if the Bank of England issues a Central Bank Digital Currency, that Central Bank Digital Currency will be backed by Sterling. You’ll be able to take your Central Bank Digital Currency tokens and get Sterling for them. They’ll be a reserve in Sterling. The real difference between cryptocurrencies and digital currencies is that digital currencies have a backing. There’s some asset sitting behind them that you can have access to. And in the case of Central Bank Digital Currencies, that Central Bank money.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. That’s a core difference. OK, thank you for clarifying that again. And also, cryptocurrencies, well, I would say, anybody could create a cryptocurrency, right? Basically, you can. That’s why there are so many, too many. And many come and go. That’s how it is. But of course, the CBDC is very different that way. So, there will be rules on that. So are there already regulation rules on that, or what kind of regulation would come in?</p>
<p>David: So, in general, we need proper regulation of the whole sector, of course. But many of these finance people I’ve spoken to have said that when there is appropriate regulation in place, they intend to tokenize everything, equities, bonds, commodities, everything. Because trading tokens is a more efficient way of trading. So, lots of people want that regulatory structure to come into place.</p>
<p>In the case of Central Bank Digital Currencies, you can already see what that should be like, because in Europe, we already have the example of the electronic money regulations. We can already issue electronic money against reserves that are sufficient quality, what you call tier one capital or HQLA (High Quality Liquid Assets). So, we can sort of see what that regulation should look like. Basically, anyone will be able to issue a currency provided they have this backing. And in the particular case of Central Bank Digital Currency, I mean, bear in mind that no central banks really want to issue this to customers directly. They want to do it through intermediaries, like banks.</p>
<p>Any digital pound token that you hold, will be backed by a Bank of England pound. I imagine. I mean, who knows what exactly those regulations will look like. But I imagine those regulations will say that you’re not allowed to charge fees on transferring in and out, I think it will have to sort of say that. You know, I don’t know exactly what the regulations will be. But I can sort of see roughly what they will be. And in that case, I assume, and I think a lot of central banks assume this, the reason that those digital currencies will become worthwhile and useful, isn’t to replicate what we already have. Like, I don’t need digital currency to go to the supermarket. I already have a debit card, it works fine. You know, that’s not the issue.</p>
<p>But the potential for innovation with those currencies, I think is very real. So, if you imagine I mean, some people talk sort of loosely about imagining money with an API. And I think that’s an interesting way of thinking about it. If you have cash that has an API, then that would mean that there will be a whole, lots of creativity could come in that space. I’m sure even now, you know, students in a lab somewhere could be building some terrific new products and services. And you know, maybe I’m too old to imagine what those will be. But I sort of think of things like micro payments, I think will be a good example. But the idea of the regulation is not to create something which allows us to do what we do now. But to put in place a platform for innovation, new ways of doing things, new products and services in the future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. One you already mentioned, you know, you are on the underground parking, yeah and you cannot use internet to pay electronically. There are many others like cases there’s no other solution today. Yeah, I guess that the most interesting thing to hear now is also what is the role of identity in this type of Central Bank Digital Currency?</p>
<p>David: Well, look, I mean, it’s very hard to imagine. It’s very hard for me to imagine that central banks will allow unlimited amounts of anonymous digital currency into circulation. And that would be catastrophic, because it would enable the criminals and terrorists and oligarchs to be free of any kind of control. And I don’t think any of us would want to live in that kind of society.</p>
<p>So therefore, there must be some kind of identity in the digital currency space. And in fact, I’d go further than that – we want some kind of digital identity in that space. It’s a good thing. And actually, the need, because digital currency needs some form of digital identity, that might actually drive digital identity forward and help digital identity to develop into the mass market.</p>
<p>Now, exactly what form that digital identity will take, that’s a very interesting subject for discussion. Should it be pseudonymous in some way? Who should know who these identities are? Who should be able to follow the transactions and manage them in this kind of thing? Those are complicated discussions, much too complicated just for a podcast. But you see what I’m driving at. There has to be some kind of digital identity.</p>
<p>And therefore, it’s good to start the discussion now, and bring the stakeholders together so that the stakeholders, and stakeholders I mean, not just banks and central banks, but I mean, law enforcement and citizens groups and lawyers and regulators. There are lots of people, because there are many issues around this to do with financial inclusion and this kind of thing. There are lots of issues that need to be resolved to get a Central Bank Digital Currency together. Identity is a really important part of that. And I think it’s useful to begin that discussion now so that people can have an educated and informed debate on how exactly that digital currency should work.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. I agree with that is a topic that yeah, not only people are talking about. And it’s, yeah, I think it’s going to happen. I think it’s something that you, every time you write, you say this is going to happen. From what I see, you could imagine from that not a desire option that this data currency is – it’s like cash, completely anonymous, going to pseudonymous and going to verify identity. It’s something still we don’t know who would verify. But yeah, it’s something– I agree with you there’s a lot of discussion have to be done now.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I’m not saying, I’m not saying I know exactly what all the answer to that should be Oscar, like, where exactly we should set the dial? I do feel that we need to have an informed debate about where to go. I think the people who are the extremists, the people who say that digital cash should be completely anonymous are clearly wrong.</p>
<p>But simultaneously, the people who say that every transaction should be traced and monitored, they’re probably wrong as well. We need to figure out exactly where the balance lies. And I don’t think that decision should be left to technologists, like me, I think that decision should involve civil society. And it will take some time, people like the Bank of England are saying that a Central Bank Digital Currency could be sort of five years away. I agree with them. But you know, it could easily take five years to work out all of these issues as to how exactly it should all work.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it can be, as you said, five years and still, do you know, in some countries there is more progress or more work on that, or how is it around the world?</p>
<p>David: Well, look, I mean, I think, you know, in different parts of the world, it’s progressing in different ways, because there are different cultural attitudes to how this should all work. So, what people in America might want and what people in China might want, will be very different, I think with this sort of thing. So, around the world, it’s progressing in different ways.</p>
<p>In the sort of developed countries, I think that those debates actually have some time to go, I really do. I don’t think it’s going to happen tomorrow. It’s just too complicated and too important to get those decisions right. Decisions that we make about how exactly is Central Bank Digital Currency going to work? These are important decisions that have ramifications for a long time. So, I am a big fan of Central Bank Digital Currency. I want to see it, but I don’t need to see it now. I need to see it; I need to see it in the future working in such a way as to benefit everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And I guess when you say, of course, some countries have more progress and Central Bank have more progress than others, of course, the ones who, yeah, have a right solution first, also we’ll take advantage like, that’s what I can– I could foresee. Yeah, it’s very difficult to see the future. What is your best way of foreseeing the first implementation, what kind of… yeah, how would you see it in practice?</p>
<p>David: We’re already seeing the pilot implementations in China, implementations in other places around the world. I think in the US and in the UK, my feeling is that we will choose privacy-enhancing technologies to be part of the infrastructure. So, if you talk to the technologists, they already have techniques, cryptographic blinding, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, this kind of thing. They already know how to do things in a more private way. What we need to decide is how exactly those will all come together to form the infrastructure.</p>
<p>But I’m actually quite optimistic about it, Oscar, because I think those technologies are already there. They already work. It could be that the legislators and the regulators may not understand how powerful those tools are or what they can do. But I do feel that we have the tools that we need. So once these stakeholders can come together and say, how anonymous or how non-anonymous it needs to be, then I think we can implement the relevant digital identity infrastructure. I think we already have all the technology; we need to do that. So yes, it will take a while, but I’m optimistic.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, there are already some pilots in some countries. Interesting. Definitely have to… yeah, interesting for everybody, I think, to have a look at those. And yeah, be prepared. Yeah. Because I think no matter which job functions, we are, I think we have to, as you say, not only technologists take part into making the decision how this system is going to be designed. Yeah, definitely very difficult to see the future. But we’ll see quite a lot progress in, as you say, in five years from now.</p>
<p>Final question I would like to ask you, David, for all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>David: I think for most businesses that I’m involved with and because I do a lot of work in finance and payments, I think for most businesses, what they need to do is to have a strategy towards digital currency. They don’t need to implement digital currency right now, it’s downstream. But they have to have a strategy because we need them to provide input into that stakeholder consultation process. So, it makes sense for retailers, for people in the value chain acquires, issuers processes, governments, law enforcement, it makes sense for them to have their strategy towards digital currency, because we need that strategy as input.</p>
<p>So just because it’s not going to happen for four or five years, well, four or five years is not a long time if you’re a bank. So, what I would say to them is, you don’t have to do anything about digital currency tomorrow, but you do have to start building a strategy towards digital currency. I hope that’s helpful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I think if you’re– I agree with having a strategy, preparing for the next 5, 10 years when this will for sure happen. OK, well, thank you very much, David. It’s super interesting this conversation about the Central Bank Digital Currency. Definitely, we’re going to hear more and more in the coming months and years. Please let us know, for someone who like to get in touch with you follow you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>David: Just follow me on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/dgwbirch">@dgwbirch</a>, or on LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgwbirch/">DGWBirch</a>, or you can always just go to my website, which is <a href="https://www.dgwbirch.com/">dgwbirch.com</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Again, Dave, it was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>

 Layer 1.5 AERGO — going&nbsp;forward <p>AERGO was an official sponsor of the Korea Blockchain Week 2022. AERGO took this opportunity to introduce the Dapps such as <a href="https://www.booost.live/">BOOOST</a>, <a href="https://plusfi.net/">Plusfi</a> and <a href="https://cccv.to/nft">CCCV</a>. CCCV also introduced CSB(CCCV Soul Bound&nbsp;Badge).</p><p><a href="https://www.booost.live/">BOOOST</a> is the first Live-To-Earn lifestyle app that pushes the boundaries of ‘To-Earn’ models while creating a Web 3.0 ecosystem that seamlessly integrates with your day-to-day activities. BOOOST recently released its <a href="https://www.booost.live/files/BOOOST%20Litepaper.pdf">litepaper</a> which you can find on its&nbsp;website.</p><p>AERGO has 3 key features; SQL base, D-DPoS (deterministic) consensus and Merkle Bridge. It is well known for being the leading hybrid blockchain for enterprises. In living up to its name, AERGO has built its partnership and use-cases with numerous companies.</p><p>From Dec. 2014 (even before Ethereum appeared), AERGO’s main aim was to become the de-facto blockchain for enterprises. Recognizing companies’ need for processing large volumes of data in real time with SQL/JDBC, AERGO targeted the private blockchain market specifically. This is where AERGO provides a conducive environment for traditional businesses to create their own mainnet immediately. AERGO’s sidechain allows enterprises to connect with AERGO’s public blockchain based on SQL’s high compatibility. Lastly, the Merkle Bridge that facilitates interoperability and asset transfer between each blockchain and sidechain allows AERGO-enabled enterprises to create their own blockchain and manage it flexibly. In summary, AERGO’s public mainnet acts as a kind of central dogma for sidechains.</p><p>During KBW 2022, AERGO was introduced as a ‘Layer 1.5’. The main reason AERGO is unique enough to be called a ‘Layer 1.5’ is due to its versatility. In other words, AERGO has both the characteristics of a Layer 1 and&nbsp;2.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that AERGO has a public chain with its own consensus structure like other layer 1s. AERGO also has layer 2 advantages — such as high ETH compatibility, low fees and high TPS — and characteristic of layer 2s which not all data is stored in a single chain but through each sidechains.</p><p>In summary, AERGO allows users to: <br> 1) configure on-demand sidechains;<br> 2) interconnect each sidechain through AERGO public; and <br> 3) provide interoperability with large blockchains such as&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>AERGO is an accessible smart contract platform for enterprises. Furthermore, AERGO enables enterprises to anchor data easily and transfer assets to a public chain by connecting the private chains in a single sidechain form. AERGO SQL, a smart contract engine, supports connecting existing DBs around the private&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Going forward, AERGO aims to expand its service scope for not only enterprises but also individual users, allowing for the issuing and utilisation of various tokens / STO / NFT / SBT, etc between all&nbsp;Layers.</p><p>These plans will be embodied through the upcoming AERGO&nbsp;Dapps.</p><p>아르고는 지난 8월 7일부터 14일까지 진행된 Korea Blockchain Week(KBW)에 공식 파트너로 참여했습니다. 아르고는 이번 행사에서 기존 파트너와 구축해온 다양한 블록체인 생태계를 소개하고, 아르고 체인을 기반으로 하는 최초의 Live-2-Earn 앱인<a href="https://www.booost.live/"> BOOOS</a>T, 디파이 서비스 <a href="https://plusfi.net/">Plusfi</a>, NFT 마켓플레이스인 <a href="https://cccv.to/nft">CCCV</a>에서 CSB(CCCV Soul Bound Badge)를&nbsp;공개했습니다.</p><p><a href="https://www.booost.live/">BOOOST</a>는 리브 투 언(live-to-earn, 일상생활에서 돈을 버는) 라이프 스타일 앱으로, P2E를 포함한 기존의 ‘-투 언(to-earn)’ 모델이 지닌 한계를 허무는 것은 물론, 우리의 일상 활동과 유기적으로 연결된 Web 3 생태계를 구성합니다. 최근 공개된 <a href="https://www.booost.live/files/BOOOST%20Litepaper.pdf">BOOOST 라이트페이퍼</a>는 <a href="https://www.booost.live/">웹사이트</a>에서 만나보실수있습니다.</p><p>이번 아르고 KBW 부스에서는 특히 ‘레이어 1.5’라는 표어가 추가되어 특히 눈길을 끌었는데요. ‘엔터프라이즈를 위한 하이브리드 블록체인’이라는 기존 표어가 아르고의 다양한 기업 파트너 및 상용화 사례를 바탕으로 했다면, 레이어 1.5는 어떤 의미를 담고 있을까요? 아르고는 어떤 의미로 레이어 1.5를 표방하고, 또 이를 달성하기 위해 어떤 노력을 진행하고 있는지, 함께&nbsp;알아보시죠.</p><p>아르고는 자체 합의 구조를 가진 레이어 1의 특장점은 물론, ▲높은 ETH 호환성 ▲높은 TPS ▲ 낮은 수수료를 비롯한 레이어 2의 특장점을 모두 갖췄습니다. 물론, 여러 레이어 1 체인들이 이더리움 생태계의 유동성을 흡수하기 위해 EVM 호환을 지원하며 최근 몇 년 사이 급격한 성장을 보여주기도&nbsp;했습니다.</p><p>아르고는 이더리움이 세상에 등장하기 이전인 2014년 12월부터 엔터프라이즈를 위한 블록체인이라는 초기 방향성을 바탕으로 기획되었습니다. 업종과 시대를 불문하고, SQL/JDBC 지원을 통해 대량의 데이터를 실시간으로 신속히 처리하고자 하는 니즈는 꾸준했기 때문입니다. 아르고는 기존의 기업 고객들이 바로 블록체인 메인넷과 연동할 수 있는 환경을 제공해 프라이빗 블록체인 시장을 공략해&nbsp;왔습니다.</p><p>아르고는 ▲SQL 언어 기반 ▲D-DPOS 합의 구조 ▲머클 브릿지라는 핵심 기능을 바탕으로 엔터프라이즈부터 퍼블릭 블록체인까지 다양한 환경에서 자원과 로직을 연동하고 활용할 수 있는 사이드 체인을 만들어&nbsp;왔습니다.</p><p>특히, 머클 브릿지는 각 블록체인과 사이드 체인간의 상호운용성과 자산 이동을 용이하게 하는 기술입니다. 아르고는 머클 브릿지를 통해 사이드체인 기반의 손쉬운 엔터프라이즈 블록체인 제작 및 유연한 운영을 지원합니다. 아르고 퍼블릭 메인넷은 각 사이드 체인의 일종의 센트럴 도그마와 같은 역할을 수행합니다. 아르고 생태계에서 모든 데이터는 하나의 체인에 저장되는 것이 아닌, 각 사이드 체인에 저장되고 운영됩니다. 레이어 2의 보편적인 특성을 갖고 있는 동시에 아르고 퍼블릭과 같은 레이어 1의 면모도 함께 갖춘, 말 그대로 ‘레이어 1.5’ 인&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>다시 한번 정리하자면, 아르고는 다음과 같은 3가지 핵심 기능을 구현하고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>1) 기업 고객 및 사용자가 용도에 맞는 별도의 사이드 체인을&nbsp;구성하고,</p><p>2) 각 사이드 체인은 메인 네트워크를 통해 상호&nbsp;연결되며,</p><p>3) 최종적으로 이더리움을 비롯한 다양한 블록체인과의 강력한 상호운용성을&nbsp;형성합니다.</p><p>기본적으로 아르고는 기업 입장에서 접근하기 굉장히 용이한 스마트 컨트랙트 플랫폼입니다. 대표적으로 아르고의 엔터프라이즈 제품은 프라이빗 체인을 중심으로 Aergo SQL이라는 스마트 컨트랙트 엔진을 통해 기존 DB를 연동하는 기능을 지원합니다. 이러한 이점을 기반으로 프라이빗 체인을 하나의 사이드 체인 형태로 연동하여, 퍼블릭 체인으로 쉽게 데이터를 앵커링하거나 자산을 이전할 수 있는&nbsp;기술입니다.</p><p>앞으로 아르고는 기업은 물론, 여러 계층의 개인 사용자를 중심으로 한 다양한 블록체인 서비스를 기획하고 있습니다. 이를 위해, 블록체인 간의 자산 이동과 각종 유틸리티 토큰/증권형 토큰/NFT/SBT 등을 적극적으로 발행하고 사용할 수 있도록 기술과 서비스를 제공하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>이러한 계획은 앞으로 선보일 아르고 Dapp들을 통해 구체화될&nbsp;것입니다.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/layer-1-5-aergo-going-forward-ad144a204823">Layer 1.5 AERGO — going forward</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

 Introduction 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieuglaude/">Mathieu Glaude</a>. I’m the CEO of Northern Block, a company bringing products to market that will help people regain sovereignty and privacy over their lives.</p>
<p>We’re hopeful that we can be one amongst the many contributors that put the building blocks in place to ensure that people’s rights are protected.</p>
<p>We’ve therefore chosen to build our products (<a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">Orbit Edge</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Orbit Enterprise</a>) on self-sovereign identity principles and open standards &amp; technologies.</p>
<p>I only personally started diving deeper into the world of digital identity in 2019, when as a company, we lacked an elegant way to let users interact with decentralized governance systems that we were building using combinations of blockchains, crypto, smart contracts, etc.</p>
<p>I must say that these past few years have been quite the learning journey for myself. I’m fortunate to be&nbsp; surrounded by a team of brilliant curious individuals who help push my knowledge every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also took it upon myself in 2021 to start doing the <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a> with thought leaders in the digital ID space, with an objective to push the industry forward.</p>
<p>Today, Northern Block is one of the many organizations contributing to Hyperledger Aries (and consuming it).</p>
<p>At this time, I felt like it made sense for me to share some of our learnings as contributors and developers of systems that use Aries, Indy and various verifiable credential implementations.</p>
<p>As I wrote this blog post, two things became apparent to me.&nbsp;</p>
 
 The various elements are evolving with the community to address specific use cases, and interdependencies between them are being eliminated to allow for ultimate flexibility and interoperability, where required. 
 Convergence seems to be happening across various elements of the ecosystem. Standards such as OIDC and mDL are all now in dialogue with W3C, AnonCreds, Aries, etc. Mobile is a predominant technology, just like the way laptops were once upon a time. To reduce consumer friction and drive adoption, convergence of all these different technologies is required inside a mobile environment 
 
<p>I hope this blog post is helpful both for people familiar and unfamiliar with Aries, Indy and AnonCreds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing learning together to help people regain sovereignty and privacy over their lives.</p>
 <br>
Learnings from Aries, Indy and Various Verifiable Credential Implementations 
 <br>
1&nbsp; Aries Protocols vs Aries Frameworks 
<p>When talking about Aries, I think it’s important to first differentiate Aries Protocols from Aries Frameworks.</p>
<p>Aries Protocols are the defined set of Request for Comment (RFCs) for the Aries project. They basically describe important topics that we want to standardize across the Aries ecosystem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Aries Frameworks are implementations of the Aries Protocols. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent – Python</a> (ACA-Py), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Aries Framework JavaScript</a> (AFJ), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Hyperledger Aries Framework Go</a>, and others.</p>
<p>Some folks in the community have reasons to use one Aries Framework over another. We at Northern Block have chosen AFJ for our mobile wallets and ACA-Py for our cloud wallets. We wrote about some of the reasons for choosing AFJ in <a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/">this recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Challenging implementations is one thing, but the protocols are what the community is committed to continuously improving together.</p>
<p>The tools (frameworks) can come and go, but if we mess up the protocols, it won’t matter what tool we wish to use to implement them.</p>
 <br>
2&nbsp; Aries Protocols Aren’t Tied to Indy 
<p>Aries is a messaging protocol between peers, with no reference to specific implementations, meaning that Aries is detached from Indy.</p>
<p>And what you move on these messaging pipes needs to refer to something stored externally, such as a wallet, ledger, or context.</p>
<p>You don’t know what tech stack the recipient is using. So you need interoperability on the pipes so that people can receive, interpret, etc. How they store it after that doesn’t matter. So Indy isn’t actually on the pipes.</p>
<p>The fact that Aries refers to Indy today is only as reference implementations. Though it’s mentioned, we shouldn’t read it as it’s tightly coupled, but instead a reference storage format.&nbsp; While it is important that protocol definitions stay independent from technical stacks, today they are not. Work must be done to make it clear in documentation that they aren’t tightly bound.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of an Aries RFC that refers to Indy. In the Present Proof protocol, you can implement the Aries protocol and attach different presentation formats.</p>
From Aries 0454-present-proof-v2, not tying Aries to any presentation formats
<p>The Aries protocol choreography (the heart of Aries) also shows that any presentation format can be attached to run it. It has nothing to do with any particular storage technology.</p>
From Aries 0454-present-proof-v2, Choreography Diagram
 <br>
3&nbsp; Aries Protocols Aren’t Tied to AnonCreds&nbsp; 
<p>Now that we’ve separated the messaging protocol from the storage, let’s look at how credentials can be stored.</p>
<p>Right now Northern Block is focused on building use cases which are privacy-preserving, thus best suited for AnonCreds. We have looked at use cases where JWT and JSON-LD credentials would be a good fit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">AnonCreds specification</a> is being developed to address a privacy-preserving specific use case with participation from the community.</p>
<p>It’s an independent specification which has evolved into its own things. AnonCreds are completely separate from Aries. And the community is working towards making AnonCreds independent of any ledger stack.</p>
<p>It’s good to see the data exchange protocol and the process protocol being developed independent of how credentials are stored. Aries is being developed to address data exchange and business process protocols, whereas AnonCreds are being developed for how credentials are stored and how they can be cryptographically secure. They are totally independent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the use case, you can choose the right combination of business process protocols. For example: mDL. For interoperability to work, one can replace Aries with mDL and use AnonCreds. Work is also in progress where the AnonCreds specification will be used to store credentials which can be consumed by OIDC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is interoperability and this is what we’re moving towards. That’s where community contributions are happening.</p>
<p>The next version of the AnonCreds specification (tentatively v1.0) will remove from the v0.1 specification any dependence on Hyperledger Indy by removing any requirements related to the storage of the objects used in AnonCreds, whether they be stored remotely on a “Verifiable Data Registry” (including Hyperledger Indy) or in local secure storage.</p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; AnonCreds are Purposely Different from the W3C VC Data Model 
<p>AnonCreds are intentionally different for a good reason:&nbsp; the ideal number of credential formats/types is &gt; 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain credential types are better for different use cases. Indy/Aries does support multiple credential types to allow for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest concern is with high assurance government credentials such as a verified person. This type of credential must support the privacy preservation provided by zero knowledge proofs and supported by AnonCreds. We don’t want to create the equivalent of a modern tracking cookie bound to a high assurance credential that uniquely identifies a person.</p>
<p>Further, we might want to use different credential formats for different schemas. Combining different credential formats could be great for certain use cases.</p>
<p>For example, I may want my address to be privacy-preserving (AnonCreds), whereas my tickets to a sports game shouldn’t be, and should be transferable (pick your W3C credential data model).</p>
<p>Again, If you’re looking for more details around this, we’d suggest you refer to <a href="https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/response-to-kaliyas-being-real-post-13fddb9410f0">Daniel’s paper</a>, which did a great job at explaining this.</p>
<p>Though current implementations are that credential and schema definitions are posted on an Indy ledger, nothing is stopping anyone who implements the Aries Framework and the AnonCreds specification to use their ledger technology of choice.</p>
 <br>
5&nbsp; CL signatures 
<p>Currently, CL signatures are used to serialize the payload prior to storage.</p>
<p>First, CL-signatures have a long history of successful usage. Real-world usage shows it is at an acceptable level for the performance of hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, Anoncreds are not explicitly tied to CL Signatures, and are replaceable/upgradeable in the future.</p>
<p>In the current state, CL signatures solve specific use cases around privacy preservation that are not possible with traditional public/private key cryptography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy preservation for high assurance issued credentials is a must have requirement for certain use cases and must be addressed by the digital ID community.</p>
<p>Now that some of the advantages of BBS+ signatures have become relevant for privacy-preserving use cases (such as selective disclosure), Northern Block is actively involved in having W3C verifiable credentials with BBS+ signatures in Aries agents. It’s being developed right now and is close to being available across the various frameworks.</p>
<p>This is an area of considerable alignment across all standards, although there are still some technical challenges to solve.&nbsp; As an industry we need to push NIST, BSI and other standards bodies to fully certify the core crypto technologies. This is not only an Aries problem.</p>
 <br>
6&nbsp; Aries Protocols Are Built with Interoperability in Mind 
<p>If VCs can be stored in different formats, can we achieve interoperability when business processes involve multiple participating entities who may choose different tech stacks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Peers can be on different tech stacks. For example, Northern Block uses ACA-Py for cloud agents and AFJ for mobile agents.</p>
<p>Interoperability isn’t about how credentials are stored. Interoperability is about the proofs that are exchanged, not what a holder is storing. How data is stored isn’t what matters in this context; what is returned is what matters. What a holder exchanges is a proof, not a credential itself.</p>
<p>Aries frameworks are where interoperability gets demonstrated and tested. Hence the message sent by one peer must be interpretable by the recipient peer. Aries agents / Aries frameworks developers must ensure that they are developing with interoperability in mind.</p>
<p>For those developers there are the Aries RFCs that outline all of the protocols and interopathon events to put all of the parties together. There are multiple reference implementations that any party can use to test their implementation, and all of this is open-source.</p>
<p>Interoperability is assessed using the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH), an open-source software that runs a series of Aries interoperability tests and uses a <a href="https://aries-interop.info/">Behavior Driven-Development</a> (BDD) framework to run tests that are designed to exercise the community-designed Aries Protocols, as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFC GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2021, Northern Block demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">AIP 1.0</a> Compliance of its Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet against the AATH (<a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">here</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>, builds on AIP 1.0 including how Aries agents can exchange several types of verifiable credentials, including W3C standard verifiable credentials.</p>
 <br>
7&nbsp; Aries Frameworks Are Built For Mobile 
<p>Now let’s move to Aries frameworks.</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we’ve built multiple Aries wallets. Over the past few years, we’ve built them using different architectures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, we have selected AFJ (<a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/">here</a>), but earlier we were using other technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more choices became available, we had more options to choose from. As the adoption of SSI increases, we expect more options to become available.</p>
<p>For the time being, there is no Aries Framework Swift – not because it is impossible – just that not enough people have wanted to put in the effort to make one. The same thing is true with Flutter. There is nothing stopping people from writing these and making them open-source.</p>
<p>AFJ is currently fitting the role with support for React-Native cross-platform mobile development.</p>
<p>Newer wallets have sizes of 50 megabytes or less. This represents 0.3% of the storage space on low end (cheap) smartphones.</p>
<p>We’ve however seen an issue in size with the limitation in the revocation registry, rather than storage. This is an issue to be addressed, but is proven to work today and is sufficiently scalable for real-world large credential deployments. No standard has a great revocation story right now and we need to ensure revocation scalability is there for use cases which need it.</p>
 8&nbsp; Aries Protocol And Frameworks Continue to Evolve Through Community Learnings 
<p>Open standards should be given time to emerge, evolve, and mature. And this has been the case with Aries protocols and frameworks. This has been a global effort.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take the evolution of how connections have been handled by Aries:</p>
<p>RFC-0160 –&gt; RFC-0023 –&gt; RFC-0434&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see an evolution of the protocol as we continued to learn, making this one a good example of agility and upgradeability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the first implementation (0160), there were challenges (e.g., the ability to re-use connections wasn’t possible, limited support for the type of DID Documents).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It evolved into the second RFC (0023) based on DID Exchange and supporting multiple DID Documents.</p>
<p>It was then superseded by 0434 which addressed remaining challenges and provided a way to support the previous two, while creating a space for new handshake protocols to be supported as they evolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main value is that when I create an invitation, I give the choice of protocols that are supported. And we can list any number of them, which takes ties away from any one specific way of doing things. Earlier this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>We expect other protocols to continue evolving through community participation.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we want to continue building robust privacy-preserving solutions and would love to engage in more conversations on how those solutions can be built while keeping interoperability with other use cases and tech stacks while avoiding vendor lock-in.&nbsp;</p>

				  Hyperledger Aries, AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy have given enterprises and governments a powerful way to build and use open source, interoperable decentralized identity technology. The reasons? A large and diverse community of developers and users is driving a virtuous cycle of robust, flexible technology and innovative implementations that meet market needs  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren and Mike Ebert</p>
<p>Hyperledger Aries, AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy are dedicated to making privacy-preserving identity solutions a reality, the exchange of trusted data easy and reliable, and the interactions between people, organizations, and systems enriching.</p>
<p>As a combination, they have demonstrated that they are robust, flexible, and extensible — capable of incorporating many new codebases, technologies, and cryptographic signatures, capable of delivering powerful solutions that have led to significant growth in implementations, community members, and customers.</p>
<p>While no technology runs perfectly on every device, a signal strength of Aries, AnonCreds, and Indy is that they work on the vast majority of current devices and systems, including $35 smart phones and low powered IOT/embedded devices. They represent the most inclusive way into this technology, which is an important factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>But as with any technology, they are also constantly evolving to meet the growing demand for decentralized identity solutions. To date, scaling has not been the primary challenge, but Aries and Indy are responding to this need. Important progress has been made, such as incorporating the Askar wallet, and work continues in areas such as clustering and multi-tenancy. The vision of having billions of verifiable credentials, devices, and users participating in trusted digital interactions all around the world has never been closer.</p>
<p>While solutions can’t simultaneously be new and tried and true, AnonCreds has been used since 2017. It is a battle-tested and reliable solution to identity and verifiable credential problems. Perhaps even more important, it is the only current credential specification that is able to meet the EU’s and real world privacy requirements; it offers the key privacy preserving features needed for marketplace identity solutions — selective disclosure, predicate proofs, and privacy-preserving holder binding. Formalization of the proven standards and best practices into an official specification is underway.</p>
<p>AnonCreds also coexists beautifully with other signature styles. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but when used for the right purposes, they complement each other powerfully. Aries added support for W3C credentials two years ago and is committed to supporting the best credentials and signature styles; Indy is incorporating cross-ledger compatibility and governance feedback.</p>
<p>All of this shows that Indy, Aries, and AnonCreds are robust, proven, trusted, dynamic, and adaptable — as are the community members, organizations, and customers that back them. They will continue to grow and be an important part of the decentralized identity and verifiable credential space, and we, as backers of these solutions and communities, are committed to creating the best solutions and making the right choices to implement and improve identity for all.</p>
 Some myths about Hyperledger Aries, AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy — and the reality 
<p>Inaccurate claims spread effortlessly on simplification, while understanding often requires mastering and translating complexity. That’s the challenge in communicating advances in science and technology. It’s easy to misunderstand what’s happening if you’re not immersed in the data or the code and then it’s hard to correct errors once they reach critical velocity or become sunk intellectual costs.</p>
<p>As leaders and active participants in the open source community, we urge people to attend these groups to learn about what they are doing, to ask questions, and, above all, to help solve problems that you see. This is the magic of open source technology—it’s open! And this openness accounts for its success in creating robust code and innovation.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is able to do this. Which is why we want to address some of the myths and misconceptions about the core open source technologies that we build on, contribute to, and use: Hyperledger Aries, and AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myth 1: Hyperledger Aries is fragile and isn’t flexible or extensible enough for decentralized identity to scale in part because it’s tied to AnonCreds</p>
<p>Reality: The reason Hyperledger Aries is the most widely used codebase for implementing verifiable credentials— by enterprises and governments alike— is that it currently provides the best extensible, flexible, and reliable platform for building verifiable credential solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Far from being structurally dependent on the AnonCreds verifiable credential specification, Hyperledger Aries supports multiple credential formats including those that follow the W3C data model. Again, this flexibility is why Hyperledger Aries is so popular: it’s the easiest way to get a verifiable credential solution implemented.</p>
<p>In addition to the support for JSON-LD W3C credentials that has been available for years, the Aries community is working on chained credentials which will, in many cases, carry both AnonCreds and JSON-LD credentials in the same message of a credential workflow. The DIDComm protocols for issuance and presentation first developed with Aries have no opinion about which credential types and signature schemes are passed within its messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all the open source codebases mentioned here, Aries has a large developer community devoted to improving the specification and code. One strength of this is that the community is able to respond to real-world needs in enterprise and public sector implementations. Technology evolves through use, and this synergy between implementation and development is an example of the virtuous cycle created by open source technology.</p>
<p>Some of the criticism of Aries appears to be driven by a “good is the enemy of the perfect” attitude; to which the answer is, “well come join the Aries community and make the good better.” We’re at the beginning of the decentralized identity journey, not at the end—and we’re in a phase of rapid growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Myth 2: Aries doesn’t adapt well to mobile use</p>
<p>Reality: We’ve heard concerns that there just isn’t enough space on a mobile phone to use Aries—or that the space issue will block scale. Newer digital wallet apps are around 50mb in size, and some are smaller. This represents just 0.3% of a low end $35 smartphone.<br><br>Other concerns focus on the unavailability of libraries for different mobile codebases. As Aries is an open source effort, libraries will be added or expanded when interest exists and contributors show up for the work. We’ve seen interest and work expand and anticipate it will continue.</p>
<p>Myth 3: Hyperledger Indy can’t manage large-scale issuance or verification</p>
<p>Reality: The idea that Hyperledger Indy networks can’t manage the mass use of verifiable credentials is contradicted by real world use. The Government of British Columbia <a href="https://www.orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">has issued millions of credentials</a> based on a few (&lt;10) writes to a ledger.</p>
<p>Any evaluation of scale requires understanding how a ledger is used. With AnonCreds, the use of a ledger scales with the number of issuers and credential schemas and, as nothing specific to a credential issuance is written to the ledger, issuance scales without impact on the ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification only requires a cached copy of the relevant ledger assets, allowing verification to scale according to the number of&nbsp; verifiers calibrated by caching policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words both issuance and verification scale independently of the number of issued or verified credentials and the assets required for verification will be downloaded and cached prior to verification, which solves the speed problem.</p>
<p>Myth 4: Current revocation is insufficient for business needs&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reality: Hyperledger Indy has the only working open source privacy-preserving revocation; it has not proved a limiting factor in any current business or public sector deployment that we’ve built and implemented.</p>
<p>Will it get better? Yes, the community is working to make it better. But the concerns about business needs are theoretical when contrasted with real world practice.</p>
<p>Myth 5: The AnonCreds specification is out of date&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reality: There are two key reasons why governments, in particular, choose to build verifiable credential solutions using AnonCreds and why the specification is the most widely used in decentralized identity solutions around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the AnonCred credential format&nbsp; is battle-tested. As an open source codebase, it’s been around and continuously updated since 2017. You can find the specification <a href="https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, it’s the only credential specification that provides the privacy-preserving features that enable verifiable credentials to comply with data privacy law. No other credential specification is able to meet these critical legal and political needs. This is a non-trivial issue (see answer below).</p>
<p>On both counts, newer isn’t better. But at the same time, open source specifications are constantly evolving. You want to make AnonCreds better? Then get involved in the <a href="https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG/anoncreds-spec">AnonCreds Specification Effort</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myth 6: Anoncreds doesn’t align with the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model.</p>
<p>Reality: The AnonCreds specification provides privacy-preserving features that no other credential specification provides: selective disclosure of data, and zero-knowledge proofs. AnonCreds also predates the W3C credential data model;&nbsp; as updating AnonCreds would yield few improvements in interoperability, such work has not been prioritized by the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The features provided by AnonCreds are essential for organizations to comply with data privacy law. This is not a theoretical point: Indicio has many global enterprise customers and they want and need privacy-preserving features in their verifiable credential implementation. If the current amendments to the European Union’s digital identity proposal are accepted, AnonCreds will be the only current verifiable credential specification that meets the EU’s privacy requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power of Hyperledger Aries and Indy is that they can support multiple credential specifications and thereby provide enterprises and organizations with the flexibility they need to build their solutions. The focus within the Aries community has been to support W3C credentials alongside AnonCreds, as they generally serve different use cases but are complimentary.</p>
<p>Two ways to learn more</p>
<p>Nothing beats learning by doing. And to this end, Indicio has created a<a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/"> series of hands-on workshops </a>on every aspect of open source decentralized identity technology for technical and non-technical audiences. We understand that the multiple concepts and codebases and workflows can be difficult to grasp on paper!&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those willing to dive in directly, we invite you to attend&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/join-a-group">the working group meetings</a> at Hyperledger. It’s always best to talk to the people actually developing these codebases rather than second-hand opinions!</p>

 IDnow is supporting IATA to simplify the passenger journey through digital identity 



<p></p>



 



<p>Munich, September 13, 2022&nbsp;– IDnow, a leading European identity proofing platform provider, is pleased to announce its participation in the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/press/accelerateiata-announces-new-airline-partners-and-3-batches-of-startups/?utm_campaign=mkg-twitter-pressrelease-all-europe-tvl-TRIBE&amp;utm_content=218930183&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-966737811448606720">Accelerate@IATA</a>&nbsp;2022 accelerator program. IDnow is working with IATA and its members, providing expertise and regulatory know-how in the field of identity proofing and digital identity. Together, IATA and IDnow are working on the shared goal of making&nbsp;flying more seamless and low-touch for passengers, while lowering fraud risks for airlines.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a href="https://www.iata.org/en/">IATA</a>&nbsp;is the trade association for the world’s airlines, representing some 290 airlines or 83% of total air traffic. As a leading industry association, IATA is shaping industry standards and the future of aviation.<br></p>



<p>Through the Accelerate@IATA program, IDnow is contributing to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">IATA One ID</a>&nbsp;working group.&nbsp;The goal of IATA One ID is to set industry standards that further streamline the passenger journey with digitalization of admissibility and a contactless process through secure biometric enabled identification. Under the One ID vision, upon completing document checks remotely, passengers will be able to arrive at the airport ready to fly and proceed through each airport touchpoint via simple biometric recognition. The objective is to achieve a truly interoperable global system across airports, airlines and governments.</p>



<p>IDnow is collaborating with airlines and other technology providers members of the IATA Think Tank on a white paper about the application of digital identity in the air travel industry. In parallel, a proof of concept is being developed to show how digital identity can support people with reduced mobility with traveling, and airlines and airports to prioritize the required staff for the necessary support.</p>



<p>“We are very pleased to have IDnow participation in the heart of industry innovation conversations. IDnow brings their expertise on the secure decentralized digital identity to support the airline industry for the journey to customer-centricity.” – Kat R. Morse, Senior Manager Innovation, Partnerships and Events at IATA.</p>



<p>“We understand that in the modern air travel industry, digital identities have a huge potential to shape a whole new traveler experience. From lowering the fraud risk for airlines, to creating a more seamless and low-touch experience for passengers and offering a GDPR compliant solution for storing and sharing of biometric pictures for airports and other players – Digital identity is the key. We are excited and proud to have been selected by IATA to work together and to partner with some of the most prestigious airlines of the world to shape the future of air travel”, says Michael A. Binner, Director Digital Identity at IDnow.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>If there is one universally true statement about every organization regardless of size, location, or industry – it is that they all have too many security problems to deal with comfortably and in time. If you believe that you have your cybersecurity well under control, you probably simply don’t have full visibility into every corner of your IT… Unsurprisingly, the idea of replacing overworked (and increasingly scarce) humans with some kind of automation both for daily administrative routine and for responding to security incidents looks universally appealing to everyone in IT. Or does it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210929005067/en/ThreatQuotient-Publishes-Research-Report-State-of-Cyber-Security-Automation-Adoption-in-2021">recent market study</a>, the majority of organizations have experienced problems implementing security automation for a variety of reasons, ranging from a lack of skills and budgets (obviously) to a much more bizarre claim of not trusting the outcomes of automation. In fact, many companies already having automation capabilities in place (such as SIEM or EDR products) do not trust them to perform any operations more advanced than sending out an alert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, we have <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/getting-a-grip-on-operational-technology">blamed industrial security experts</a> for sticking to their old ways and putting safety and process continuity above security. Meanwhile, AI and machine learning technologies have been making great strides and entire new market segments for intelligent and highly automated security solutions have emerged. And yet, even people not involved in OT security are still afraid of them. But why?&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding security automation&nbsp; 
<p>Before diving into technical details of implementing security automation, it can perhaps be useful to address a couple of common misconceptions about it. First, the goal of automating cybersecurity is not to eliminate humans from the decision-making process or drive security analysts to unemployment. On the contrary, the whole idea is to automate the least interesting but most tedious parts of the repetitive manual activities we have to face daily – from separating meaningful security events from false positives to making disjointed legacy tools work together efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless this unqualified menial labor is the only thing you do as a security analyst, there is really nothing to be worried about – automation will actually allow you to spend your time on more challenging and rewarding tasks. You will also always have the final say in every potentially disruptive decision (and a good automation tool will not just help you make the right one, but also to evaluate its potential risks beforehand). Unless, of course, you’ll decide to block any future attacks of the same kind automatically…&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, it is also important to stress that investigating and responding to security incidents is definitely not the only area of cybersecurity that needs to be automated. Proactive measures such as identifying vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure or application code, as well as regulatory compliance, can greatly benefit from intelligent automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And speaking of intelligence: contrary to many people’s beliefs, artificial intelligence and machine learning should not be the primary focus of any automation strategy. While AI/ML provide a multitude of opportunities to automate specific narrow tasks, on a strategic scale, automating processes, workflows and collaboration between people is much more important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80016/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar">Security Orchestration, Automation and Response</a> (SOAR) products are perhaps the most promising class of solutions that helps, well, orchestrate the processes between other tools and products that do not support this integration natively. However, this market is still evolving rapidly, and most currently available tools tend to focus on automating forensic investigations and incident response. Designing a universal platform that could automate all security-related processes in an organization is thus still a challenge that every company must address individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a sense, security automation as a concept can be compared to another popular buzzword – Zero Trust. Both do not refer to specific technologies or products, but rather deal with architectures and guiding principles. However, whereas you still “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022/blog/you-cannot-buy-zero-trust-but-thats-actually-ok">cannot buy Zero Trust</a>”, the situation with security automation tools nowadays is a complete opposite. There are so many various products that promise to solve all your automation needs that finding the right combination of tools becomes a problem that might need a bit of automation itself…&nbsp;</p>
 Would you like to know more?&nbsp; 
<p>Security automation will be one of the key topics at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit</a> in Berlin this November. Whether you are looking for strategic advice from industry analysts or are more interested in technical implementation details, you will surely find the right people and relevant presentations at the event. For example, check out “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5205/1">Sustainable vulnerability management: Case Study by KuppingerCole</a>” by Christopher Schütze, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5205/2">Security Automation Strategies to Succeed or Fail: You Choose</a>” by Dr. Donnie Wendt of Mastercard, or a panel discussion on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5205/3">Implementing Enterprise Security Automation for Threat Detection and Intelligence</a>”.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><a href="https://northernblock.io/">Northern Block</a> has been selected as part of 16 startups to join<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/innovation/accelerate/"> Accelerate@IATA’s</a> 2022 cohort, a travel tech startup accelerator jointly run by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Plug and Play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program is designed to give airlines and new entrants to the aviation industry an environment to connect and reach the pilot stage. Airline members and the value chain will have the opportunity to identify focus areas and select and engage with solutions providers/startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northern Block is part of the third theme of the program which is “Customer as the Reference”. We will be participating with six other startups to help airlines create more personalized offers and orders. We are excited to be working among a great group of airlines such as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-airlines/"> Singapore Airlines</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/emirates/"> Emirates</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/royal-air-maroc/"> Royal Air Maroc</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/copa-airlines/"> Copa Airlines</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/korean-air/"> Korean Air</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-airlines-group-iag-/"> International Airlines Group (IAG)</a>, and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/japan-airlines/"> Japan Airlines</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the aviation industry is in a post-covid boom, there are many opportunities to leverage DigitalTrust and Self Sovereign Identity to bring the aviation industry to the next level. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re interested in exploring SSI use cases in Aviation and/or Transportation,<a href="https://meetings.hubspot.com/odubeau">&nbsp;schedule a call&nbsp;</a>with us to discuss!</p>
<p>About Accelerate@IATA &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accelerate@IATA is a travel tech startup accelerator designed to support airlines through open innovation. This program gives airlines and value chain partners access to startups and leading-edge technologies, to facilitate projects, pilots, and implementations between the partners and the startups. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, Accelerate@IATA plans to accelerate ~5 startups per batch, 20 – 30 startups per year. Every batch will be selected by IATA and member airlines based on industry priorities.</p>
<p>During the program, startups have access to IATA Subject Matter Experts and Plug and Play’s mentor network, giving them a true innovation mindset to help them improve their solutions and scale to meet industry demand.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are super excited to join the Accelerate@IATA, ” said Khalid Maliki, COO at Northern Block. IATA is spot on for our activities, it will help us access an incredible network of talented people within the Aviation industry and two critical markets, Europe and MENA. We are looking to improve the overall travel experience through our SSI solutions” &nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>Spruce’s continued mission is to let users control their data across the web, whether it’s web2, web3, or beyond. This also applies to credentials issued by existing entities, such as the Mobile Driver License (mDL) issued by motor vehicle authorities across the world.</p><p>There is now a global standard called <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a> that describes how we can represent a digital driver’s license on someone’s smartphone, and the whole end-to-end process on how to present it in-person. However, the methods to provision them, refresh them, or send them online are still under active discussion within ISO working groups. In the US, TSA and other organizations have already committed to using this standard, so it impacts DMVs who want their mobile driver’s licenses to also be useful for travel at the airport. In other countries, there is beginning to be adopted as well.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/2021-07-29-aclu-eff-epic-comments-re-dhss-mdl">EFF, ACLU, and EPIC</a> recently have called out several concerns regarding implementations of the mDLs in their comments to a Department of Homeland Security request for comments, and as implementers of open source digital identity software, we have additional concerns in the mix that we felt it necessary to call out too:</p>  User choice for identity wallets may be restricted to just a few companies due to anti-competitive policies for device API access. Hardware manufacturers and operating system vendors use internal APIs that third-party developers cannot access, meaning wallets by app developers will not be able to create a competitive user experience or security model on a level playing field. Practically, this could funnel users to just the operating system-provided identity wallets and extinguish the possibility of increased user choice when handling their most critical data.  Is a large tech company the right decision maker for how state-issued digital identities can be used on billions of devices, especially in light of many recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/apple-sued-over-apple-pay-accused-of-antitrust-violations">antitrust allegations</a>? For example, gatekeeping of verifiers occurs with Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/wallet/verifying_wallet_identity_requests">PassKit restricting the verifier set</a> to Apple’s approved list of developers. In the physical world, we don’t have to ask Apple to inspect a driver’s license. This seems a lot like a policy decision for users who have mobile driver’s licenses. When was the last time your leather wallet told you that you couldn’t use something how you wanted?  <p>The EFF further has recommended W3C Verifiable Credentials due to their history of being developed in the public, and being an open standard. We agree with this. Vendors such as Microsoft, Ping Identity, Workday, and Spruce have already adopted these in pilots and production use cases. Furthermore, Underwriter Labs, an author of ISO 18013-5, has described how to <a href="https://www.ul.com/insights/verifiable-credentials-and-isoiec-18013-5-based-credentials">interoperate Verifiable Credentials with the ISO described data model</a> and protocols. We look forward to continuing our collaborations here such as demonstrating interoperability with TBD:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-and-tbd-demonstrate-decentralized-identity-interoperability/">  Spruce and TBD Demonstrate Decentralized Identity Interoperability  We have heard a lot about Decentralized Identity in the last few years. For both Spruce and TBD, Decentralized Identity and user control are at the center of both our missions, and we are excited to announce that we achieved another milestone towards interoperability.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We think that this can culminate in an Identity Wallet Bill of Rights that describes how a third party wallet provider can participate on an even playing field, allowing for an entire ecosystem instead of 2-3 vendors thereby increasing user choice. This way, users can enjoy increased wallet selection built on open protocols and standards, ensuring that a market can form to tailor to specific use cases. Identity is far too important and critical of a component to leave to two or three companies to dominate. </p><p>When was the last time you had to ask a tech company for permission to use your passport, with the implication that they could lock you out entirely? If things continue without an open ecosystem for identity wallets, this could be the unfortunate reality. Digital identity is still in its infancy, and it’s not too late to start now.</p><p>In our efforts to help lead this charge, we are sponsoring a community project <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">led by Kaliya Young</a>, a longstanding member of the identity ecosystem, to lead this and help create a level playing field for identity wallets without compromising on security. At Spruce, we believe that users should have a choice in which wallet manages their most critical data, and that two or three companies should not dictate the most meaningful and high-stakes digital interactions for billions of people.</p><p>Towards this, we are working on a set of requirements that we believe would enable wallet providers to achieve the same levels of user experience, functionality, and security that are enjoyed by wallets with privileged, internal APIs not currently available to third-party developers. We want to invite you to do the same through this community effort so that together we can ensure that wallets have a level playing field and that users have true choice. If we can get this right, we have a real opportunity to get it right for users across identity, payments, and beyond in the digital era.</p><p>We will continue to pursue our efforts in the decentralized identity ecosystem, and always champion architectures that put users first.</p><p>Check out this link for the full community project announcement:</p><a href="https://medium.com/@identitywoman-in-business/where-the-w3c-verifiable-credentials-meets-the-iso-18013-5-mobile-driving-license-2b0a6c992920">  Where the W3C Verifiable Credentials meets the ISO 18013–5 Mobile Driving License  New Community Project Sponsored by Spruce  MediumIdentity Woman in Business    </a> <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

 Ocean Protocol and Dimitra announce Phase 2 of the Data Challenge: Algorithms, Analytics, Narratives &amp;&nbsp;Reports <p>The strategic phase will incentivise data analysis and the building of algorithms to harness the power of agricultural data for global&nbsp;change.</p><p>Singapore, September 12th: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the Web3 platform to unlock data services for AI and business innovation, has launched the second phase of the Ocean and <a href="https://dimitra.io/">Dimitra</a> Data Challenge — an initiative guided by the mission to gather data-driven insights and encourage algorithm building to solve complex challenges in agriculture. From a prize pool of $10,000, the rewards for this phase are: 1st place: $4,000, 2nd place: $3,000, 3rd place: $2,000, Community Award: $1,000 (payable in OCEAN +&nbsp;DMTR).</p><p>The Phase 2 <a href="https://bit.ly/dimitra-p2">datasets</a> are live on the Ocean Market and the entry submission deadline is September 30 at midnight UTC. To enter the competition and access complete bounty details, go to the dedicated Questbook <a href="https://bit.ly/3RViD6N">page</a>.</p><p>The participants must at least perform the graphical methods outlined in the challenge <a href="https://bit.ly/3RViD6N">description</a> in order to be considered for the competition. They are free to augment the challenge dataset with any open-source real-data dataset of their choice. Bonus points will be awarded for publishing the referenced data on the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.</p><p>The partnership between Dimitra’s agricultural software and Ocean’s Web3 data sharing and monetization capabilities is focused on driving the next generation of agricultural solutions using data and accelerating the adoption of Web3. In line with this vision, the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</a> was launched in July 2022 with the aim to maximize yields and mitigate operational losses for farmers across the globe with relevant, valuable data-driven insights and algorithms.</p><p>Ocean Founder Bruce Pon&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“The global agriculture industry is facing its biggest changes and data-driven productivity improvements are the need of the hour. With our data challenge, we have all the tools in place to build relevant context around farming data, build models to improve outcomes and influence the direction of the agriculture sector for the&nbsp;better.”</blockquote><p>Jon Trask, CEO of Dimitra, commented:</p><blockquote>“As we enter Phase Two of our data science challenge we are looking forward to testing the data scientists’ use of a variety of techniques which may reveal important insights into the growth of soybeans based on ten years of historical data. I’m interested to understand the trends and changes that are affecting performance and possible insights into the nature or impact of recent climatic events that may influence crop performance. Hidden knowledge is disguised in the data and I hope to see how this group of data scientists reveal the opportunities hidden behind the&nbsp;mask.”</blockquote><p>As part of the Ocean-Dimitra Data challenge Phase 2: Algorithms, Analytics, Narratives &amp; Reports, participants will be presented with a dataset containing the crop yield data for soybeans in the 46 districts of Madhya Pradesh state, India and the MODIS satellite data on normalized difference vegetation, leaf area, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature and rainfall. The challenge is to study the target soybean yields satellite data, rank the factors that affect yields and accordingly build a simple model to predict yields based on the features. The participants will also identify and explain any trends in the yield data over a 10-year period. The goal of this phase is to gain insights into the nature and impact of recent climatic events that may have influenced crop performance.</p><p>A panel of evaluators from Ocean and Dimitra will independently review and rank submission entries selecting 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners. The selection will be announced publicly and the community will be invited to vote for the Community Choice award winner. All valid entries submitted will receive an award of 250 $OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>About Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</a> is part of the broader <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Data Bounty program</a> — a strategic initiative incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms to solve complex business challenges.</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ideation phase</a> focused on garnering valuable ideas on how agricultural datasets in the Ocean Market could be utilized to maximize yields and crop quality while minimizing risks for farmers in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. A panel of team judges chose the top three winners for their submissions on crop yield prediction algorithms, and key factors influencing yield and profitability through data analysis. The Community Award and 5 honourable mentions were also conferred based on the level of innovation, the value of opportunity, feasibility, and completeness of&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a New Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing&nbsp;it.</p><p>About Dimitra</p><p>Dimitra’s mission is to place technology in the hands of millions of small farmers around the world. By doing so, Dimitra aims to enhance productivity and, therefore, the lives of farmers, improve food safety, and enable greater food security globally.</p><p>In 2021 it set itself two additional objectives.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p> </p>
<p>Is the security sector served well by the standards, regulations, and frameworks we have?</p>
<p>The security industry has been around for a good few years and we've understood the importance of standards. If you look at the way that standards, frameworks, and regulations work, it does take quite some time for them to come into place. In the early days, we had standards, which may have been around specific technologies, but they were quite general. So for example, we had the standards around wireless encryption. So, there are those sorts of standards. We have standards around technologies. We have standards around products. We have standards around organizations. So for example, the BS 5577, a long time ago, was what eventually became known as the ISO 27,001 series or the starting of it.</p>
<p>The standards came first, then as time went on, we had more frameworks coming into play. For example, the Cloud Security Alliance is having some frameworks, ISACA itself has got a great framework, couple of frameworks. And also you find that over some time, different regulatory bodies have created their regulations. So the finance sector has often had its own. Now, the challenge with all of these things is that because they are trying to cover so many things and be all and everything to many, many people, especially those people that sit on these committees, it takes a long time to negotiate them. And because it takes a long time to negotiate them, it also takes a long time to greet them and get them out there. There are a lot of standards out there and it doesn't mean we've covered all the things that we need to cover in security. So they are evolving as time goes on. And again, this 27,000 series has shown because you've got different components of that now. We are beginning to get to the point where some of the technologies are converging in a direction that's quite useful. You're beginning to see some of the convergence aspects that are fit as well. And IoT is a very good example of that.</p>
<p>I'd say, yes, those are a lot of standards. There are regulations and frameworks, plenty of them, plenty to choose from and definitely, the security industry is well covered. But that doesn't mean that we've got everything covered. It's well covered in that we've got a good set of standards already at the moment that we can build on to meet the changing needs that we may have.</p>
<p>What role do standards and frameworks have in a world where threats and risks are forever changing?</p>
<p>We're in an environment where technology is changing so fast and responses to technology are a little bit slow because we can only really work in retrospect in many respects, looking at where the threats are, where the risks are. We tend to think backward rather than forwards quite often in many of these things, partly because we're in a position where we've got limited budgets, we can't go round trying to cover every risk, we have to cover those that are the biggest risks. And we have to look at the likelihood that things are going to happen, and the impacts those things are going to have. Because there are so many variations that we need to look at and the threats that are out there, we start to figure out where we want to spend our money and we start to think about the changes that are out there in terms of the threats that we need to respond to. Our budgets need to be forward-thinking. Yet at the same time, we've got technologies that are always backward thinking. We're trying to think about what's happened, where it's happened, why it's happened, and what we need to be doing next. So in terms of the standards, we're in a position where many of these things came about some time ago, and although they came about some time ago, they were almost ready for yesteryear's threats that were out there. My session thinks about that and I'll be covering what it is, and why they were good for their times at some point. And the fact that today we're in a much, much faster-changing world, that our standards if they're not changing just as fast as the threats are changing, they act, they're beginning to feel more like checklists. And if you've got checklists, as good as a checklist may well be, it's nothing more than a checkbox exercise. And that's one of the things that many security professionals are often saying about standards, there are many organizations out there that have been breached and they've been breached even though they comply with certain standards, frameworks, and regulations that comply with them. But even though they're complying, they are still being breached. And that's partly because they're complying with these things that were written five, six, seven, eight years ago in many cases. What we need to be looking at is how can we update them in shorter periods to reflect some of the threats that are emerging out there.</p>
<p>What will you be covering in your session?</p>
<p>In that keynote session, I'll be looking at giving a couple of examples of standards and frameworks that were out there, and I'll be looking at how they meet today's environment and pulling them to pieces intentionally. I know some of the ones that I've chosen are due to be changed or in the process of being changed, but effectively, the fact remains that standards do take a long time to change. We need to figure out how we can make the best use of them in a way that they're more than just a checkbox exercise. And in many respects, some organizations that may not have any security, they're a brilliant starting point. Having a good starting point is great. But if that starting point isn't going to take you anywhere more than a starting point, you need to think about the sort of threats that you're likely to get as an organization that you need to be doing. And I know that many organizations out there do have to comply in some respects with PCI DSS or HIPAA or with 27,001 and so on. So I've been looking at those as examples of saying what they were created for and how quickly they came out of date.</p>

				  Premature Standardization &amp; Interoperability  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>TL;DR: While I applaud the efforts to create “interoperability” in the SSI, decentralized identity, authentic data, and whatever else you want to call this domain, it’s premature to think we have real “standards.” We have, instead, premature standardization and tiny pockets of very focused interoperability.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is an early document that will likely evolve – in that more and more depth may be provided. The content may be re-factored enough that what this document looks like in mid-2022 could look wildly different in a short period.</p>
<p>Here’s my premise – we don’t have standards nor interoperability – at least not as people really need. We have been through a process that is powerful and good – but what we have is what I call “premature standardization.” It’s a great start but nowhere near where things will be.</p>
<p>There are many reasons we haven’t reached “interoperability,” and I believe we are far away from deep interop.</p>
<p>First, we have attempted an immaculate conception approach to achieve interoperability. We think we could define what the baby will be and not do the hard and messy work of really creating something.</p>
<p>You can’t jump the steps required to generate real Interoperability. The reasons are deeper than I will go into right now, but interoperability is born out of the desire for systems to interact. Sure we have that notionally in the various groups attacking this problem – <a href="https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/working-group-activity/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C CCG</a>, and other places – are working to create multiple things that will be needed in the complex symphony of interoperability that we require.</p>
<p>Here’s the starting point for my premise – you can’t skip steps.</p>
<p>It would help if you got your industry understanding things at a very, very deep and intimate depth. What is really needed as opposed to proposing ideas that haven’t been used in earnest for long enough?</p>
<p>There are two key dimensions that you need to understand.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 Industry/Ecosystems – Are you talking about a single ecosystem or moving between wildly different ecosystems? 
 Technical Stacks – Are you talking about interoperability between systems using the same stack or different stacks? 
 
<p>These two dimensions need to be handled separately.</p>
<p>Each dimension – the Ecosystems and the Stacks have different needs.</p>
<p>Different ecosystems will have competing requirements. Let’s use SSI as an example. Let’s compare two different industries to see their different needs.</p>



Industry One
Industry Two



<p>– credentials need to be small, and the devices providing them have a severe limit on power draw</p>
<p>– the credentials used are used in total (i.e. their full data payload is always at play)</p>
<p>– the credentials must work when major parts of the system are disconnected or offline for extended periods</p>


<p>– High-value credentials that contain very private information are key</p>
<p>– Verifiers of the information are legally required to ask only what is necessary for their query</p>
<p>– Offline is essential and, in some cases, critical, but not expected to be running offline for weeks on end</p>




<p>This is a somewhat artificial but not unreal scenario. Compare the IoT industry with the travel industry; you will see that they are pretty distinct. There certainly are similar patterns, though.</p>
<p>Let’s similarly look at different stacks.</p>



Stack One
Stack Two



<p>– used across various integration cases – data from databases, sensors, governments, etc.</p>
<p>– the system is message-centric</p>
<p>– the system is meant to run on mobile and low-power devices</p>


<p>– Broadly created to meet integration needs with IAM systems (e.g. OIDC).</p>
<p>– Used for data sharing in an API web-centric context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Both stacks above are valid and meet a particular set of needs.</p>
<p>How can these Ecosystems and Stacks be interoperable?</p>
<p>They do this in stages – and IN ORDER.</p>
<p>They all start in a Single Ecosystem and Single Stack. We’ve seen many of these.</p>
<p>THEN they start crossing into the Multiple sides – but they really only add one of the dimensions at a time. A Single Stack &amp; Single Ecosystem approach can do one of the following at a time:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 Add Mulltiple Ecosystems (Path 1) – given various business reasons, using the same stack and applying the approaches to multiple industries expands the breadth and significantly: the depth of knowledge of where the Stacks meets/falls short. 
 Add Multiple Stack (Path 2) – in the same ecosystem adding other stacks into play begins to learn where different approaches work better and where there is no need to duplicate capabilities. 
 
<p>The following two paths are more about pressure from outside, and both get pulled into the broader Multiple Ecosystem + Multiple Stack world.</p>
<p>The critical thing to understand here is that an Interoperability Compliance Suite is required for either of the following paths to be viable. This compliance suite sets the conditions by which competitors can point to a reference as their definition of interoperability.</p>
<p>Depending on which path (1 or 2) was taken, we have two courses:</p>
 
 A Multiple Stack + Single Ecosystem adds support for Multiple Ecosystems (Path 3) &nbsp;– the compliance suites here help more about context, ecosystem-specific semantics, and syntax. 
 A Single Stack + Multiple Ecosystem adds support for Multiple Stacks (Path 4) – this path required Interoperability Compliance Suites to prove that the competing stacks are not finger-pointing. 
 
<p>I am unaware of any real interoperable solutions that circumvented these paths. Further, each transition is expensive in terms of resources (people, time and funds), so the market pulls it. This is a “you can’t push a rope” scenario.</p>

We’d like to publish our response in the open. While we won’t get into specifics in this post, we resonate with many of her points and have been evolving our platform to not only remain relevant, but innovate on what it means to be a decentralized identity platform.</p>

				<p>The Hyperledger Indy + Aries bundle of technologies, complete with Anoncreds verifiable credential format, was the first production-ready suite of SSI technologies to hit the market. Trinsic’s founding team were key contributors in the <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">beginnings of the Aries project</a>. Shortly thereafter, Trinsic <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id/status/1232289435317784582">launched the world’s first full-stack SSI platform</a> based on these technologies. Subsequently, that Aries-powered platform has been used in hundreds of proofs-of-concept, pilot projects, and production deployments. Those experiences produced mountains of learnings critical for application developers, infrastructure vendors such as ourselves, and the open source community in our shared goal of self-sovereign identity.<br><br></p><p>As more customers went into production, we gathered their feedback and heard them loud and clear. We made improvements to our platform to address their concerns where it was possible. However, when we realized our customers were facing critical limitations caused by the underlying tech stack, we began developing an updated version of our platform that would reduce our dependency on these technologies and enable a better platform for our customers.</p>

				<p>Trinsic’s goal is to be the infrastructure of choice for developers who are building identity wallets and ecosystems to provide more people access to re-usable and self-sovereign identity. We make complex technology easy to use through turnkey APIs and understandable documentation.<br><br></p><p>As an infrastructure provider, it is critical we build on modular technologies that are scalable and extensible so we can:<br><br></p>  Support a variety of standards as they evolve, including verifiable credential formats like W3C VC Data Model, BBS Signature w/ VCs, KERI ACDCs, and ISO 18013-5 mDLs; communication protocols such as OIDC and DIDComm; and roots of trust such as ION, Ethereum, and traditional DNS infrastructure.  Scale to the volumes and metrics needed by our customers, in terms of throughput, response time, and reliability.  Build developer tools that fit our customers’ workflows, including wallets that are accessible using any device, available in multiple programming languages, and support built-in governance.  <p><br>These are the main motivations behind our development of Trinsic Ecosystems, the next iteration of our platform. Trinsic Ecosystems is built with the lessons learned from production deployments with over 100,000 live, end-users across the world. In addition, Trinsic Ecosystems already has customers using it in production with extremely positive results.<br><br></p><p>While we are investing all our efforts into making Trinsic Ecosystems the best it can be, we will continue to support our existing platform for the foreseeable future. We have many customers whose projects are built on the Indy/Aries stack, and we have every intention of making each of them successful. Moving forward:<br><br></p>  We will eventually sunset our existing platform based on Aries, although we do not have a specific date set for that. When we make that decision we’ll communicate it publicly and work with each team with production deployment on a migration plan.  Other than a few edge cases, Trinsic Ecosystems is far superior to Trinsic’s existing platform, and we will work closely with any of our customers who wish to migrate to ensure a smooth transition.  We are targeting for Trinsic Ecosystems to become the exclusive platform we provide to new customers by the end of the calendar year.  <p><br>For more information about Trinsic Ecosystems and the specific technical differences relative to our existing platform, please see our <a href="https://docs-v2.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/">Migration Guide</a> in our documentation.</p>

												<a>How do I get started with Trinsic Ecosystems?</a>
					 

					 <p>Trinsic Ecosystems is being used in production, and we (and our customers!) couldn’t be happier with the results. We’re working closely with an exclusive set of customers to ensure their feedback makes it into the product rapidly. If you’re interested in building on Trinsic Ecosystems, <a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">please </a><a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">reach out</a>.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>What about interoperability with Aries moving forward?</a>
					 

					 <p>Interoperability is a keystone of SSI and something our customers almost universally need eventually. Today, Trinsic Ecosystems supports the W3C verifiable credential standard and OIDC-based verifications, which are interoperable in their respective domains, but Trinsic Ecosystems is not interoperable with Aries yet.</p><p><br>We intend on bringing support for Aries interoperability to Trinsic Ecosystems over time. One of the most challenging issues with the Hyperledger Indy/Aries tech is how bundled the current implementations are. Trinsic Ecosystems is built in such a way where we can easily add support for components of the stack separately—and some of these components are on the roadmap already:<br><br></p>  Indy: a legitimate option for anchoring public DIDs  Aries: messaging protocols and interoperability profiles for exchanging data between wallets  Anoncreds: a variant of verifiable credential which is now beginning to be documented and standardized   
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>What should I do if I’m currently using Aries?</a>
					 

					 <p>Of course the answer is “it depends”. If you’re experimenting with a proof-of-concept, then you probably don’t have much to worry about. We wrote a document outlining who should migrate, and how, in our <a href="https://docs-v2.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/#motivations-to-build-the-new-platform">documentation</a>. If you’re intending on scaling to users in production or have questions about migration, we suggest you <a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">get in touch with us</a> to discuss your situation.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Why not fix Trinsic’s existing platform instead of build Trinsic Ecosystems?</a>
					 

					 <p>We invested months of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars on improving Trinsic’s existing platform. But we found some of the challenges with the underlying tech caused scaling and performance problems that couldn’t be feasibly overcome. The best option ahead of us was to develop something built from the ground-up with the requirements of real-world, production usage in mind.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Why not wait for the community to fix the problems with Aries?</a>
					 

					 <p>We’re focused on building the best products, period. We don’t have a <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/not-invented-here-syndrome/">“not built here” complex</a> with regard to developments in the SSI the space. Our customers and partners put their trust in us to be objective in our pursuit of the best possible platform. This is our only incentive—we don’t have consulting revenue or other forms of income to sustain us, so if we don’t create the best platform on earth, our business will be at risk.<br><br></p><p>So while we welcome developments of the open source ecosystem, we can’t sit around and wait for improvements like Anoncreds 2.0, which has been discussed for ~4 years, to be completed. If there are solutions that better solve our problems, we have a fiduciary duty to opt for those solutions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwords are knowledge-based, meaning they can easily be guessed or stolen. They’re also a source of user frustration, which can negatively impact employee productivity, customer satisfaction, and ultimately revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that considered, how do you reconcile this when passwords—despite their shortcomings—are really the only digital security solution society has ever known?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good question. The answer is going passwordless, which several leading enterprises across the industry are pursuing via FIDO passkeys.&nbsp;</p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN Insights, by our Americas Ecosystem Lead, Erick&nbsp;Pinos. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article written by Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology.</p><p>Web3 is an interconnected set of technologies, protocols, concepts, and frameworks that represent the next stage of a more decentralized Internet. These past few years, we saw glimpses of a Web3 enabled future through Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Both of these technologies enabled new kinds of online peer-to-peer interactions. DeFi allowed users access to financial instruments without meddling middlemen, and NFTs enabled provable ownership of virtual goods such as in-game assets, digital art, or intellectual property.</p><p>However, DeFi and NFTs are just two verticals of Web3. Other important verticals include Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for decentralized coordination in the creation of Web3 infrastructure, and Decentralized Identity (DID) for the self-sovereignty of one’s own data while interacting with Web3 services. We can predict what it will take for these remaining Web3 pillars to see similar adoption by studying the history of how the more well-known pillars saw rapid adoption.</p><p>DeFi</p><p>While DeFi became the most popular blockchain use case in late 2020, many of the most popular DeFi projects existed for years before. MakerDAO launched in 2017. Uniswap, Compound, and Aave launched in 2018. 1inch launched in 2019, and so on. You could use these services for their intended purposes, but it wasn’t until yield farming programs were put into place that usage took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Indeed, yield farming took the crypto world by storm in 2020. The prospect of earning tokens with your assets made many a millionaire and captured the attention of many new DeFi projects looking to grow a user base very quickly. As a result, a slew of projects launched in a short amount of time and aimed at capitalizing on this phenomenon. From decentralized exchanges and liquidity aggregators to decentralized lending and derivatives, almost any DeFi project could receive a massive boost in users and total value locked from offering token incentives to provide liquidity to their platform.</p><p>It’s no surprise that offering financial incentives will draw in a large user base, but what about retention? Unfortunately, many DeFi projects implemented yield farming unsustainably, issuing massive rewards through inflation of their own governance tokens, resulting in high but short-lived APYs at the expense of their project’s token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>NFTs</p><p>As the DeFi hype died down in 2021, attention moved to NFTs. It was possible to mint NFTs back in 2017, but it was technically challenging to do so. Even after no-code NFT minting tools became easier to use in 2020, pioneered by NFT marketplaces such as Rarible, it wasn’t until 2021 when prominent artists like Beeple repeatedly sold NFT art for tens of millions of dollars a piece that content creators from all over rushed to mint their art as NFTs in the hopes of earning an income through this new medium. PFP projects pushed the NFT hype forward even more. Why sell one or a few NFT art pieces when you can sell 10,000 programmatically generated variations of the same&nbsp;image?</p><p>For better or for worse, the financialization of a Web3 technology accelerates its adoption.</p><p>That leaves us with DAOs and DID. There are many Web3 projects that use these technologies today. But unlike DeFi and NFTs, DAOs and DID have yet to see adoption on a similar scale, and I believe it is mainly due to the lack of financialization of these technologies. Once it becomes straightforward as to how users can make money with this tech, we’ll see similar hype cycles and corresponding corrections on the likes of DeFi and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Lets see some examples of what such financialization would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>DAOs</p><p>There are many no-code tools that allow for communities to spin up their own DAOs, such as Snapshot for decentralized proposal-making and voting, and Gnosis for multi-sig management of a group’s treasury. In today’s DAOs, community members vote on governance decisions, elect committees, serve as signers on its multisig, etc. But how are they compensated for their time and contributions? Making participating in a DAO financially sustainable for participants is key for mass adoption.</p><p>One such way is through the standardization and automation of bounty programs. Manual bounty programs are cumbersome, with bounty creators needing to write out assignments and claim forms to manually review and disburse payments. If DeFi projects had to onboard liquidity providers one at a time, then manually sit down and disburse yield farming payments to each one, they would have never grown as big as they did as quickly as they&nbsp;did.</p><p>Similarly, bounty programs need to be re-invented like an assembly line. Bounties need to become standardized and easy to post, find, take, review, and integrate back into the main project. We also need to expand the idea of what constitutes a bounty to include tasks and micro-tasks. Designing a logo, voting in a proposal, reposting a tweet, and serving on a committee all should be valid bounties with different scopes and rewards. Once bounties become standardized and processes become automated, there could be as many bounty hunters as there were yield&nbsp;farmers.</p><p>Decentralized Identity</p><p>Currently, data brokers make billions of dollars off of peoples’ data collected via countless terms of service agreements and privacy policies signed every day. You see none of that revenue, and in some cases you can’t even opt out of having your data sold by these data&nbsp;brokers.</p><p>DID is a system that attaches decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for people, entities, and objects with verifiable credentials (VCs) that store properties about those identities. This new structure allows for users to hide their data, selectively reveal it only when necessary, and even charge to access it. This opens up a host of new monetization strategies for users. If you owned your own data, you could benefit from directly selling it. Examples are earning revenue for consensually selling your own data for surveys, targeted advertising, studies, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Scalability comes through the automation of these opportunities and programmatic access to such trusted and verifiable data, with streaming payments sent to the provider on a per-use basis. Such a process is not possible without a solid Web3 foundational infrastructure. It needs to become easier for projects to buy datasets directly from the community directly than from buying datasets from data brokers. And, on the user side, it needs to become easy for users to record and sell their data repeatedly easily to as many buyers as they would&nbsp;like.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>There are a plethora of Web3 technologies and even more projects implementing them. Financialization of these technologies isn’t all that matters to drive mass adoption, but it is a powerful driving force. We must take great care in implementing it sustainably and with properly aligned incentives in place to ensure Web3 develops optimally.</p><p>We are in the early stages and are just beginning to see glimpses of what a Web3 enabled future looks like. But, using the recent past as an example, we can predict what it will look like and what we need to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-06-the-financialization-of-daos-and-did-370d959f620d">OWN Insights 07: The Financialization of DAOs and DID</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 In a world where we rely increasingly on digital information, we need to know that the credentials we share are accurate. <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> (or Trust Hubs) will help us verify the authenticity of the information we share by storing digital certificates that can verify the identity of individuals and organizations. These certificates can authenticate online transactions, access sensitive information, or sign documents electronically.&nbsp;<p></p>
<p>Trust Registries will help to reduce fraud and ensure that only accurate information is shared. They will also help build back confidence in the digital economy and enable new types of interactions that are impossible with traditional paper-based systems.</p>
<p>As we continue <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registry-task-force/">highlighting the importance</a> of Trust Registries over the coming months, the following real-world example from the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets-series/">State of Digital Wallet Series</a> “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/further-research-and-effort-digitalwallet-part-10-16/">Further Research &amp; Effort</a>” gives us a great picture of how critical Trust Registries are within digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
 A Home Renovation. 
<p>Let’s imagine a home renovation project with three main groups to think about:</p>
 
 Homeowner 
 Contractor 
 City Inspector 
 
<p>Trust Registries allow us to know that the various shared credentials (e.g. proof of insurance) are accurate. A Homeowner can ask their Digital Wallet to verify an insurance Credential that the Contractor is honest. Their Digital Wallet needs to prove a few things:</p>
 
 The Contractor was the entity to which the Insurer (the Issuer) gave the Credential. Done inside the Contractor’s Digital Wallet – it uses cryptography to prove that they still control the insurance Credential. 
 That the Insurer cryptographically signed the Credential – letting the Homeowner know that the information hasn’t been tampered with. 
 That the Insurer is a bona fide insurance company, there will need to be a Trust Hub that lists insurers for a particular area for this to happen. 
 
<p>Digital Wallets can do all of the above in just a few seconds while doing other checks. Each party involved has pieces of information that they need to verify.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Homeowner wants to know that they have the proper permits and licences for the job and that their Contractor and employees are fully licensed, insured, and up to scratch.&nbsp; 
 The Contractor wants to know that the Homeowner has the proper permits, licence, inspections and insurance.&nbsp; 
 The City Inspector wants to know that the Homeowner and Contractor have the required licenses, training, and other paperwork. 
 
<p>The paper-based verification process takes so long that few homeowners ever do the checks they should. With digital wallets and the ecosystems behind them, verifications can get done in seconds—while we greet each other in person.</p>
 A critical tool for re-establishing trust 
<p>Trust Registries will be a critical tool for re-establishing trust online. They will help users identify trustworthy websites and online services and help businesses build trust with their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecosystems are evolving – quickly, and it’s time to start thinking about how we will manage trust and reputation and how Trust Registries help to anchor the confidence we need in our systems.</p>

 KILT in Action — The dena Blockchain Pilot&nbsp;Project <p>Introduction by Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>The project on machine identities led by dena, the German federal energy agency, was finished successfully. KILT served as a core partner in this project by supplying the machine identities and demonstrating the utility of a blockchain protocol in a highly regulated environment like the energy sector. This was an important milestone for us: DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and KILT in general are ready for large scale, institutional use cases that fulfil requirements from regulators. Blockchain technology is finding its way into industry!</p><p>Also of note: During the project we deployed a complete KILT node on a Raspberry Pi-based smart meter, demonstrating the efficiency of Parity Substrate-based blockchains.</p><p>Blog Post by Majella Horan, Lead Writer for KILT Protocol<br><a href="https://www.dena.de/en/home/">dena</a> has released a report on its pilot project on digital machine identities as the basic building block for an automated energy system. KILT was part of the project, providing decentralized machine identities registered on the KILT blockchain and showing how blockchain technology can be used inside a highly-regulated environment.</p><p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> collaborated on this initiative with industry leaders from the energy sector, the digital economy and science including <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.enbw.com/">EnBW</a>, <a href="https://www.eon.com/en.html">e-on</a>, <a href="https://www.riddleandcode.com/">Riddle &amp; Code</a>, <a href="https://www.my-oli.com/en/">Oli-Systems</a>, and <a href="https://www.50hertz.com/">50&nbsp;Hertz</a>.</p> dena Project: Background <p>Government agencies and industry are increasingly looking to blockchain solutions to help achieve effective and compliant digitalization. The modern energy industry faces challenges in coordinating an increasing number of energy-producing and energy-consuming devices in the grid infrastructure, from energy plants to electric vehicles, heat pumps and storage&nbsp;systems.</p><p>dena launched the Future Energy Lab pilot project in 2019 to explore these issues. The goal was to create a Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL), a decentralized digital registry that aimed to coordinate and connect devices and energy plants across the German energy&nbsp;system.</p><p>The project incorporated the current smart meter gateway technology, and required creating uniform digital identities for energy systems. It was designed as a three-pronged pilot project to demonstrate the technical, economic and regulatory feasibility of three variants:</p>  Storing the identity characteristics directly at the smart meter&nbsp;gateway  Storing the identity characteristics directly on the&nbsp;device  Storing the identity characteristics in the&nbsp;cloud  <p>All variants needed to meet governmental standards of data security and protection, scalability and privacy in a cost-effective way.</p><p>KILT Protocol was integrated for the first two variants, with the identities to be generated and stored directly on the&nbsp;devices.</p> Digital Machine Identities with&nbsp;KILT <p>As context for the KILT integration with dena, it’s important to understand KILT’s identity framework, which has two key components:</p>  A decentralized identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies an entity or device (as a fingerprint does for humans),&nbsp;and  Verifiable, revocable credentials that are confirmed by trusted parties (“Attesters”).  <p>In this way, a digital identity can be built for people, machines, services and anything that identities can be built&nbsp;on.</p><p>Standardized digital identities for machines form the basic building block for an automated and reliable energy system. For this pilot project with dena, the machine identities each contained:</p>  A decentralized identifier (DID), which uniquely identified the device,&nbsp;and  The characteristics, attributes or properties that made this machine different from others. These were attached to the DID in the form of digital certificates, or verifiable credentials (VCs). These credentials show the static and dynamic properties of the&nbsp;device.  <p>KILT is pleased to be part of the dena Future Energy Lab project, making a practical and effective contribution to current energy challenges and showing how blockchain technology can be used in a highly regulated, real-world environment.</p><p>The following is a technical description of the project including the technical integration of KILT. The full report is <a href="https://www.dena.de/fileadmin/dena/Publikationen/PDFs/2022/Digitale_Maschinen-Identitaeten_als_Grundbaustein_fuer_ein_automatisiertes_Energiesystem.pdf">published here</a> in German; dena will publish an English version&nbsp;shortly.</p> dena Project:&nbsp;Summary <p>The BMIL pilot project aimed to close an important gap that is currently a barrier to implementing a real-time energy economy using the smart meter gateway and blockchain technology: the lack of digital identities for energy&nbsp;systems.</p><p>One of the key elements was to agree on and test uniform digital identity standards, namely DIDs and verifiable credentials.</p><p>The DID enables end-to-end encryption between digital agents, allowing data to be exchanged between participants and systems without the need for a centralized data silo by establishing a Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL) that allows assets to register their identity (their unique DID and verifiable credentials).</p><p>These digital, self-sovereign and decentralized device identities were set up and either stored and anchored on the device itself, or via a digital twin in the cloud, depending on the&nbsp;variant.</p><p>Transmission of the digital identity was implemented in regular operation via the smart gateway infrastructure and could be linked to the BMIL through the installation of a BMIL-compatible smart&nbsp;meter.</p> dena Project: KILT Integration <p>The integration of the KILT Protocol into the BMIL project is summarized here, using the example of the device-centric identity management in conjunction with a dedicated Controllable Local System (CLS) device, the OLI Box. The integration was the same for both variants.</p><p>As the goal was to achieve a high degree of decentralization, the identities were stored directly on the respective devices and anchored on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>In the first step, the private/public key pair is generated on the box. The OLI box’s crypto chip provides the random input for generating the key pair to establish the necessary security and connect the keypair to the&nbsp;box.</p><p>Then the identifier or DID is generated on the device and anchored on the blockchain. The DID document is signed by the box in order to link it to the DID, and is then stored in the DID&nbsp;store.</p><p>Through the claimer application, the credential workflow is implemented on the OLI box. It implements the claiming of properties, the requesting of a credential, the storing of an issued credential on the box, and the sharing of credentials with the verifiers. It can either share the whole credential, or only single attributes via selective disclosure, if the verifier does not need to know the whole credential.</p><p>To ensure privacy, the credentials are not stored on the blockchain. Credentials remain with the device (the OLI box) and are only anchored on the blockchain as a hash representing the data by the issuer of the credential. The anchored credential on the blockchain does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the content and owner of the credential. Via the hash, only verifiers to which the credentials were disclosed can check the validity of that credential on the blockchain.</p><p>The different actors, e.g., the application of the Energy Web Foundation to prequalify device identities for different use cases through VC-based role assignment and others, communicate with each other via the KILT messaging service using encrypted messages.</p> dena Project: Conclusions <p>Digital identities built around DIDs and verifiable credentials provide the new standards needed for identity for governmental projects going forward. This standardization ensures uniformity, contributes to efficiency and security, and allows system services to be provided and called up fully automatically.</p><p>Future research will build on these findings and create services and applications to increase energy efficiency.</p><p>KILT is a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and DIDs, providing practical, secure identity solutions for enterprises and consumers.</p><p>Discover more on the KILT <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a>, or follow KILT on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> to keep up with the latest&nbsp;news.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-in-action-the-dena-blockchain-pilot-project-a384cb2629a7">KILT in Action — The dena Blockchain Pilot Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
