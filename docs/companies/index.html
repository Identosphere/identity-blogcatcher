 Keren Weitzberg &amp; Aaron&nbsp;Martin <p>AI is on everyone’s lips. So perhaps it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/event/biometrics-institute-congress-and-side-events-2024/">this year’s Biometrics Institute Congress</a> was filled with much hand-wringing about AI. A self-described “non-profit,” the Biometrics Institute is probably best understood as part industry lobbying group, part think tank, part research institute. Each year, it holds a conference in London, which brings together policymakers, vendors, regulators, privacy rights groups, and the occasional not-so-undercover academic (like ourselves).</p><p>Here are some of our key insights from this year’s congress:</p> Biometric vendors are currently debating how to define themselves vis-a-vis AI and how to engage with the current AI hype&nbsp;cycle <p>“AI” is a notoriously slippery term, so much so that scholars, civil society groups, and policymakers continue to argue over its <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2022/10/one-of-the-biggest-problems-in-regulating-ai-is-agreeing-on-a-definition?lang=en">very definition</a>. Such debates are not purely semantic; rather, they shape how an industry is regulated, how it approaches funders and clients, how it is publicly understood, and how it understands itself. In their annual ‘<a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/state-of-biometrics-report-2024/">state of the industry’ report</a>, the Biometric Institute tackles this question, asking <a href="https://x.com/BiometricsInst/status/1852365480574730340">“To AI or not to AI”</a>? (We would attempt to summarize the key points for blog readers but alas it is proprietary knowledge that is only available to paid members…) At the Congress, panelists and keynote speakers raised what seemed almost existential and ontological questions. One session, for example, was entitled “What is the relationship between AI and biometrics?”</p><p>From one perspective, the relationship between AI and biometrics may seem obvious: AI is expected to enhance the functionality of identity checks. Thanks to machine learning and artificial neural networks, biometric systems have become <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-biometrics-irreversible-couple-veridas-yfhtf/">far more accurate and precise </a>in recent years, improving their technical performance and increasing their spread and market share. More recently, generative AI is posing new risks and vulnerabilities for the sector, including sophisticated forms of synthetic identity fraud, such as <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5362102/">face morphing</a>, which has the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202409/fraunhofer-develops-a-system-to-address-face-morphing-attacks-in-border-control">potential</a> to disrupt the security of the travel sector. OpenAI’s release of its real-time voice API, for example, has renewed alarms about fraudsters <a href="https://x.com/BiometricUpdate/status/1851739442547224825">circumventing voice recognition software</a>.</p><p>But AI is also part of a powerful tech and regulatory imaginary. At the Congress, AI seemed less a technology (or set of technologies) to be adopted than a loaded, polyvalent term to be contended with. Generating a kind of “hyperreality,” AI seems to be everything and nothing at once, invoking both dystopian and utopian futures, producing vociferous proponents, equally vocal detractors, and a growing (if sometimes quieter and more measured) group of skeptics.</p><p>The biometrics industry has long been anxious with its public reputation, particularly in the wake of a string of controversies over <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms/#:~:text=Facial%20recognition%20is%20less%20accurate,positive%20matches%20in%20image%20databases.">encoded racism</a> within facial recognition algorithms and in light of mounting resistance to the use of biometric systems for policing, migration control, and <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/4528/biometrics-collection-under-pretext-counter-terrorism">state repression</a>. A <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/congress-to-tackle-risks-of-ai-and-facial-recognition/">recent industry survey</a> by the Biometrics Institute revealed concerns that public mistrust with AI would spill over into the sector, further inflaming public opinion: “A significant 80% of respondents believe public opinion on AI will directly impact their views on biometrics. This highlights the need to address public concerns about AI to build trust in biometric applications.” This is one of many reasons why vendors and clients may seek to distance themselves from the AI moniker, or at least carefully navigate how they relate to the capacious and ambiguous term.</p> Regulators and industry are not necessarily at odds with one&nbsp;another <p>The Biometrics Institute is a space of engagement — one where regulators and industry can speak productively and where regulators can make a case for compliance. This is in contrast to common understandings about the relationship between regulation and business, whereby the regulators are thought to be adversarial and mistrusting of industry operators.</p><p>Several representatives of governmental regulatory bodies were in attendance at this year’s Congress, including the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Other key public stakeholders in attendance were the EU’s DG CNECT, which oversees the EU’s AI Act, and the Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties at the US Department of Justice. The tone struck in their presentations was one of cooperation and assistance. As John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, told the audience, “we are on the same side.” Emphasizing that the UK is a space where biometric technologies can flourish, he argued that regulators can help industry: “We want you to be able to use biometric data that add value to society and protect people’s privacy.”</p><p>This is not necessarily a story of regulatory capture, but it does speak to the way that industry and regulatory bodies are actively shaping one another. It certainly reflects an increasingly accepted mode of regulation that emphasizes cooperation and highlights the benefits of technological innovation, potentially at the expense of fundamental rights protection.</p> Rather than restrict biometric use cases, AI regulations may, in the long run, facilitate (and legitimate) their&nbsp;spread <p>Rather than necessarily inhibiting the biometrics industry, AI regulation can help the sector identify and manage risk, benefiting corporate players. Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>, which has recently begun to come into force. Several presentations at the Congress were devoted to the new Act and its implications for industry. Irina Orssich, Head of Sector AI Policy at DG CNECT, explained that the Act takes a risk-based approach to biometrics. It divides use cases into a taxonomy of risk — from unacceptable to high-risk to limited to low/minimal risk. Compliance with the EU AI Act and adoption of this taxonomy can be seen as a form of risk mitigation — a means for companies to limit their liability and exposure in ways that will keep regulators at bay. Importantly, however, it also legitimates those applications that are deemed to be less risky according to the&nbsp;rules.</p><p>“Besides minimising risks,”<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17579961.2021.1898300"> notes legal scholar Nathalie Smuha</a>, “regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the…‘race to AI.’” The same could be said about biometrics and how emerging regulations will facilitate their further adoption and acceptance in different contexts, including consumer applications and more security-oriented spaces like borders. It is therefore incumbent upon critical voices to assess how regulators, and the rules they are mandated to enforce, further entrench biometrics in our everyday lives (whether or not they are ultimately understood to be AI) and the implications of this legitimization for our societies and polities.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/to-ai-or-not-to-ai-insights-from-the-biometrics-institute-congress-2024-0e2668418bd3">To AI or Not to AI?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>For two decades, KuppingerCole Analysts is monitoring the IAM, Digital Identity, and Cybersecurity market. With our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?f=leadershipcompass">Leadership Compass</a> reports on market segments, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?f=buyerscompass">Buyer’s Compass</a> providing insights and criteria for decision makers, or the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?f=executiveview">Executive View</a> reports on individual solutions, we already have a range of reports covering the markets in breadth and depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, there is another member of that family of publications: KuppingerCole Rising Stars.</p>
<p>This new report is devoted on innovative vendors, commonly in the start-up stage from early start-ups with initial customers to companies that already have demonstrated their growth potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We talk with 100’s of start-ups and emerging vendors every year. Now, we will rate them based on a defined set of criteria, with innovativeness and product-market-fit being most relevant, but also looking at their management, organizational structure, and other factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors that pass our defined, ambitious thresholds will earn the “KuppingerCole Rising Star” rating for their strong market potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe these reports will be of value for both decision makers in end-user organizations and financial investors, setting a spotlight on vendors that are not yet broadly known and visible but should be observed. For end-user organizations, they might fill gaps or even become an alternative to established vendors. For investors, they are logical targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned!&nbsp;</p>

 This Month in Digital Identity — November&nbsp;Edition <p>Welcome to the November edition of our monthly digital identity series! This month, we’re diving into essential advancements shaping digital identity and the future of secure verification. Discover key updates on the European Digital Identity Wallet, the latest approaches to mobile driver’s license verification, and how deepfake detection is evolving to tackle growing threats. Plus, we’ll explore Jumio’s innovative biometric liveness detection and its role in combating identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what you’ll find in this month’s insights:</p> The EUDI&nbsp;Wallet <p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet is a transformative initiative designed to provide EU citizens with a secure, self-sovereign digital identity solution. This wallet enables individuals to manage their identity information independently, ensuring privacy and security in online interactions. By facilitating access to essential services such as banking, healthcare, and governmental applications, the EUDI Wallet promises to streamline daily life and foster a more inclusive digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>However, its implementation faces several significant challenges. Firstly, robust cybersecurity measures are crucial to prevent identity theft and data breaches, which could undermine user trust. Secondly, achieving regulatory harmonization across diverse EU member states is essential, as different countries have unique legal frameworks and privacy regulations. Without a unified approach, the wallet’s effectiveness could be compromised, leading to confusion among users and service providers alike.</p><p>Collaboration among various stakeholders—including government agencies, technology providers, and civil society—will be pivotal in overcoming these hurdles. By establishing clear standards for security, interoperability, and user experience, the EUDI Wallet can become a reliable tool that empowers citizens while safeguarding their data. Ultimately, its success will hinge on building public trust and ensuring that the system is user-friendly, accessible, and compliant with the highest privacy standards.</p> mDL Verification <p>The emergence of mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) signifies a significant shift in identity verification, presenting both opportunities and challenges for users and authorities. mDLs offer a modern alternative to traditional physical licenses, allowing users to carry their identification securely on their smartphones. This technological advancement aims to streamline the verification process for a wide range of services, from travel to online transactions.</p><p>However, the implementation of mDLs is fraught with challenges. One primary concern is the need for secure and intuitive verification processes that maintain user confidence while preventing identity fraud. Additionally, the lack of uniformity in regulations across different states poses a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Each state has its own legal standards and technical requirements, complicating interoperability and making it difficult for users to rely on their mDLs outside their home jurisdictions.</p><p>Privacy is another critical issue, as users must be assured that their personal information will remain secure and confidential. Striking a balance between robust security measures and a seamless user experience is essential for gaining public acceptance.</p><p>To facilitate the successful rollout of mDLs, continuous collaboration among stakeholders — including government agencies, technology developers, and consumers — is vital. By establishing best practices and regulatory frameworks, stakeholders can ensure that mDLs become a trusted and widely accepted form of identification, paving the way for a more secure and efficient digital identity landscape.</p> Deepfake Detection <p>The rise of deepfake technology presents significant challenges to the authenticity of digital content, raising concerns about misinformation and trust in media. Deepfakes utilize advanced artificial intelligence to create highly realistic but fabricated videos and audio, making it increasingly difficult for viewers to discern truth from deception. As this technology becomes more sophisticated, the need for effective detection methods becomes paramount.</p><p>Various techniques are being developed to identify deepfakes, focusing on detecting subtle inconsistencies that can indicate manipulation. These methods include analyzing facial movements, lighting discrepancies, and unnatural expressions, which may signal that a video has been altered. As detection technologies evolve, they must continuously adapt to keep pace with advances in deepfake creation.</p><p>A multi-pronged approach is essential to mitigate the risks associated with deepfakes. This involves not only developing robust technological solutions but also enhancing public awareness about the existence and implications of deepfakes. Educating consumers on how to recognize manipulated content is critical in fostering a more discerning audience that can critically evaluate the media they&nbsp;consume.</p><p>Regulatory measures also play a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by deepfakes. Policymakers must consider ethical guidelines and legal frameworks that govern the creation and dissemination of synthetic media. By promoting transparency and accountability in digital content creation, society can better safeguard against the potential harms of deepfakes while preserving the integrity of visual communication.</p> Jumio’s Biometric Liveness Detection <p>Jumio’s development of in-house biometric liveness detection technology represents a significant leap forward in identity verification. As identity fraud becomes more prevalent, this innovative solution uses sophisticated artificial intelligence to accurately differentiate between genuine biometric data—such as facial recognition—and spoofing attempts, including photographs or masks. This capability is crucial for enhancing security in online transactions and customer onboarding processes.</p><p>The liveness detection technology analyzes various data points in real time, assessing factors such as facial movements and eye interactions to determine whether the biometric input is from a live person. By integrating this technology into their identity verification offerings, Jumio aims to provide organizations with a more reliable means of preventing identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Moreover, as the digital landscape evolves, the demand for effective biometric verification solutions is increasing. Organizations must navigate the dual challenge of enhancing security while ensuring a smooth user experience. Jumio’s biometric liveness detection addresses this need, positioning the company as a leader in the identity verification market.</p><p>In an environment where digital interactions are ubiquitous, establishing trust in online transactions is paramount. By offering advanced biometric solutions, Jumio is helping to build confidence among consumers and organizations alike, making it easier to engage in secure digital commerce. As identity verification technologies continue to evolve, Jumio’s innovations will play a vital role in shaping the future of secure online interactions.</p><p>We look forward to bringing you more insightful updates as we continue to explore the latest trends and innovations in the field of digital identity. Together, we can contribute to a more secure and inclusive digital&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/this-month-in-digital-identity-november-edition-59572dfbe9ca">This Month in Digital Identity — November Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Trust Alliance New Zealand’s Digital Farm Wallet, co-developed by Indicio and Anonyme Labs, wins “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity” award. This is the second time Indicio’s Verifiable Credential technology has won a SuperNova Award. 
<p><a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance New Zealand</a> (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium representing farmers and other agriculture-chain stakeholders, has won one of the most prestigious awards in technology, a <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2024">Constellation SuperNova Award</a>. The awards recognize business transformation, and TANZ won in the category of Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity.</p>
<p>TANZ’s Digital Farm Wallet uses Verifiable Credentials to create a data-sharing ecosystem for producers, growers, exporters, retailers &amp; consumers. This allows farmers to hold data around emissions, land, water usage, and be able to share it directly and securely with reliant parties, removing the need for large databases or the need to manually keep sending the same information over and over again.</p>
<p>This project and technology is transformational for anyone working in agriculture. The ability to directly share authenticated information between farmers and distributors in a secure, privacy-preserving way realized significant cost benefits in the trial. Farmers spent less time on form-filling and data management and more time farming. In the future, it represents a more streamlined, transparent supply chain, one where farmers have the ability to not only promise organic or green growing practices, but where the consumers can verify the claims for themselves using credentials at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the project and see the technology in action you can watch an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzd99h3lmNU">in-depth video here.</a></p>
<p>This is the second time an Indicio customer has won a SuperNova Award. The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">first</a> was in 2022 for technology that went on to support the launch of <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">Digital Travel Credentials.</a></p>

<p><br>
[30 October 2024, Bangkok]</p>
<p>Northern Block, in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and key industry partners, has demonstrated that the future of air travel is digital. In a groundbreaking proof-of-concept (PoC), two passengers completed a fully digital, round-trip journey between Hong Kong and Tokyo on October 21 and 22, using digital wallets and travel credentials to navigate airport processes seamlessly.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve achieved something unprecedented here, extending beyond technical trust to build an ecosystem that is secure, reliable, and user-friendly at every stage,” said Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>This PoC demonstrated an unparalleled level of interoperability, bringing together over five technology solution providers and supporting more than five distinct types of digital credentials. Two different digital wallets offered an excellent user experience, while the inclusion of a trust registry provided assurance that each credential came from an authorized issuer, reinforcing trust across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>
</p>  <p></p>
 Highlighting Northern Block’s Role in Credential Verification and Trust Registries 
<p>Northern Block played a pivotal role by providing Cathay Pacific with its Orbit Enterprise Credentialing API for credential verification, along with an Orbit Trust Registry instance that allowed verifiers to confirm issuer authority, ensuring credential legitimacy throughout the passenger journey. Trust registries are foundational in communicating credential issuer conformance against an ecosystem governance framework, enhancing the integrity of each interaction. By verifying that every credential originates from an authorized issuer, the trust registry establishes a layer of trust that goes beyond technical requirements, embedding governance principles at every step.</p>
<p></p>
 Standards-Based Interoperability: Key to a Seamless Experience 
<p>This PoC demonstrated technical standards critical to enabling credential exchange and trust registry functionality. By aligning with IATA’s Technical Interoperability Profile, Northern Block and other vendors adhered to credential exchange protocols like OpenID for Verifiable Credentials, credential formats such as SD-JWT VC, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) such as did:web, and more. This alignment ensured that diverse solutions could operate seamlessly in a live, international airport setting.</p>
<p>For the trust registry, the Trust over IP’s Trust Registry Query Protocol (TRQP) allowed verifiers to confirm issuer statuses quickly and reliably, supporting real-time decision-making and building confidence across the open ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
 Highlights of the Proof-of-Concept<p></p>
<p></p> 
 
  Digital Identity and Biometrics: A Fully Digital Travel Experience<br>
Biometric verification paired with digital credentials allowed travelers to navigate airport processes, including check-in and boarding, without presenting physical documents. 
 
 
  Credential Verification and Interoperability<br>
Northern Block’s Credential Exchange API enabled Cathay Pacific to verify credentials, and industry-standard VCs, such as boarding passes and visa credentials, were integrated seamlessly using multiple vendor solutions. 
 
 
  Trusted Issuer Verification with Trust Registry<br>
The trust registry verified each credential’s issuer authority, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of credentials from multiple issuers. By leveraging standards, this PoC demonstrates that digital credentials can be trusted and accepted across jurisdictions. 
 
 
  IATA’s Open API Hub: A Gateway for Digital Travel<br>
Now accessible in IATA’s <a href="https://api.developer.iata.org/collection/digital-identity">Open API Hub</a>, Northern Block’s Credential Exchange API offers air travel stakeholders the infrastructure to support digital credentials and enhance the travel experience.<p></p>
<p></p> 
 
 Moving Forward 
<p>As we see more adoption of digital credentials, trust registries are becoming a foundational trust establishment infrastructure. They will help to enhance the travel journey, and enable value creation in retailing, service delivery, and across the whole partner value chain. We invite you to join us in future projects as we continue to push towards digital transformation of the airline industry together.</p>

  <p>As part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative">Secure Future Initiative</a>, we’ve evolved our security approach to align with three security principles: secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. Secure by default means security protections are enabled and enforced by default. In Microsoft Entra, security defaults are an example demonstrating our secure by default approach. Security defaults are enabled for every new tenant. This provides a baseline level of protection for your Entra identities and resources. To make sure that organizations relying on security defaults are well protected, we’re updating a requirement for authentication method to help improve your security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re removing the option to skip multifactor authentication (MFA) registration for 14 days when security defaults are enabled. This means all users will be required to register for MFA on their first login after security defaults are turned on. This will help reduce the risk of account compromise during the 14-day window, as MFA can block over 99.2% of identity-based attacks. This change affects newly created tenants starting on December 2nd, 2024 and will be rolled out to existing tenants starting in January 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update is part of our ongoing effort to provide you with a secure and reliable identity service. We recommend that you enable security defaults for your organization if you’ are not using Conditional Access, as security defaults offer a simple and effective way to protect your users and resources from common threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Have you ever watched a creator’s video and thought, "Where did she get that top?" or "I need that protein powder"? You scroll through the comments, only to see the infamous "link in my bio" comment. You rush to click the link, and you're hit with-page not found 😒. I remember once being so desperate that I took a screenshot of the item and reverse-searched it on Google Images. I found something similar but not what I wanted. SO frustrating. Eventually, I gave up and kept on scrolling.</p>

<p>Now, imagine how many potential sales that creator lost because a third-party platform’s server was down. Their metrics won't even reflect those missed opportunities, making it harder to secure brand deals. Who actually has time for that? That’s when I realized I could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> to create my own decentralized link hub utilizing service endpoints. With this setup, all my links and contact info are stored in one place—owned and controlled by me. Even if a service that houses all my links goes down, my links will always be accessible because they’re not reliant on any external platforms to display them. I’m sharing this in hopes that fellow creators won’t miss out on potential brand deals, and I won't have to cry over a top I never got to buy.</p>

<p>Before I show you exactly how you can create your own decentralized link hub, lets answer some of the questions you're probably asking yourself. </p>

 
  
  
  What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?
 

<p>So, what exactly is a Decentralized Identifier, or DID? Think of it as your username—the one source of truth for everything you do online—except this one is owned and controlled entirely by you. It’s a unique "address", thats verifiable and doesn’t rely on any central authority like Facebook, Google, or any other service. Instead, DIDs give you the freedom to manage your own identity online, without needing to trust a single platform to store or validate your information.</p>

<p>In the context of a decentralized link hub, your DID becomes the hub for all your important links. It’s not tied to any third-party service, which means you never have to worry about followers scrolling simply because your link page isn't working. When you update your links, you only need to do it once, as they're tied to your DID—so they stay consistent across all your social platforms, giving you full control. When you update your links, they stay up-to-date across the web because again they’re tied to your DID—giving you full control.</p>

 
  
  
  How are Service Endpoints going to help me?
 

<p>Now, let’s cover what service endpoints are. These might sound technical, but they’re actually pretty simple—think of them like your digital address/phone book. Remember those huge yellow books you used to sit on at the hair salon? They were filled with phone numbers and addresses, making it easy to find and contact people. Well, service endpoints are kind of like that, except they’re the digital "addresses" for different parts of your online identity. These could be links to your Instagram profile, website, direct messages, or even your affiliate links.</p>

<p>These endpoints live in your <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents#what-is-a-did-document">DID document</a>. So instead of relying on centralized services like Linktree, your DID acts as the home for all your important links. So when someone <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-resolve-a-did">resolves your DID</a>, they can access the service endpoints that you’ve decided to share.</p>

<p>You can also easily update and delete these links anytime you need to again without relying on any third-party platform to keep those connections working.</p>

 
  
  
  The fix: let's create a decentralized Link Hub
 

<p>If you’re more of a visual learner, check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/knYteCFYuno">YouTube short</a> where I show you exactly how. For this example we're going to create a DID with two service endpoints. One pointing to my LinkedIn and the other pointing to my X profile. </p>

<p>Step 1: Import <code>web5/dids</code> package<br>
</p>

 
 <code>import {DidDht} from '@web5/dids'
</code> 

 



<p>Step 2: Create DID with service endpoints<br>
</p>

 
 <code>const myBearerDid = await DidDht.create({
    options:{
        publish: true,
        services: [
            {
                id: 'LinkedIn',
                type: 'professional',
                serviceEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis'
            },
            {
                id: 'X',
                type: 'personal',
                serviceEndpoint: 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis'
            }
        ]
    }
});
</code> 

 



<p>Now that we've created your DID with service endpoints leading to your LinkedIn and X profiles.</p>

<p>Step 3: Lets print our entire DID also know as a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary/#bearer-did">BearerDid</a> to see our DID document where these service endpoints can be found:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>console.log(myBearerDid)
</code> 

 



<blockquote>
<p>It is important to never share your full BearerDID, it contains private keys that only you should have access to. The holder of these keys can perform private key operations, like signing data. Check out this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/key-management">Key Management Guide</a> to learn how to properly manage your DID keys. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Output:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>my bearerDid BearerDid {
  uri: 'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey',

<p>This output contains your DID string(uri) thats your "username" along with the services array and some authentication and verification methods. To learn more refer to this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents">DID Document</a> Guide. </p>

<p>Step 4: Now lets look closely at just our <code>serviceEndpoint</code> array:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>console.log("personal link hub", myBearerDid.document.service || "No Services Found");
</code> 

 



<p>Output:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>decentralized link hub [
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn',
    type: 'professional',
    serviceEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis'
  },
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#X',
    type: 'personal',
    serviceEndpoint: 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis'
  }
]
</code> 

 



 
  
  
  How do I share these links?
 

<p>Now that your DID is in your bio, how do your followers access your links? It's simple- they just need to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-resolve-a-did">resolve your DID</a> to see a full list of your shared links: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The resolving of your DID will differ depending on the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary#did-method">DID method</a> used to create the DID. In this example we are using the <code>DHT</code> DID method:<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

 
 <code>// DID in your bio
const didDhtUri = 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y'

// resolve the DID
const resolvedDhtDid = await DidDht.resolve(didDhtUri);

// access the DID Document's service links
const dhtDidDocument = resolvedDhtDid.didDocument.service;

console.log(dhtDidDocument)
</code> 

 



<p>Output:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>[
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn#LinkedIn',

				 <p>Thirty minutes from plane to beach. That’s the stress-free vision Aruba had for its tourist-driven economy. Now, thanks to a collaboration with <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, a global leader in air travel IT, and <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, a global leader in decentralized identity, that vision is a reality.</p>
<p>In a presentation at the forthcoming <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/events/all/wfs--wps/">IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and World Passenger Symposium (WPS)</a> in Bangkok, Michael Zureik, Senior Digital Identity Architect from SITA, will explain how travelers flying from Atlanta to Aruba used a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/digital-travel/">Digital Travel Credential (DTC)</a> developed by SITA, the government of Aruba, and Indicio, and incorporated it with the <a href="https://www.iata.org/">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a> <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">OneID</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.delta.com/">Delta Air Lines</a>.</p>
<p>The combination enabled travelers to the Caribbean island to get preauthorization for travel before flying (using the DTC),&nbsp; streamline their check-in, baggage drop, and boarding at Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta (using IATA One ID), and then cross the border in seconds upon arrival in Aruba (using the DTC). They then boarded a tour bus and were on the beach within the 30-minute time frame.</p>
<p>The result is transformational for international travel. It heralds the arrival of seamless digital travel, where travelers get to hold their data on their mobile devices and present it for instant cryptographic verification to prove who they are. This streamlines the journey from booking to arrival, reduces waiting times, especially at border crossings, while providing data privacy for the traveler and better security for airlines, airports, and governments.</p>
<p>The trial is the first of its kind to merge the two leading decentralized digital travel identities into one workflow. Because the DTC is an authenticated digital version of a verified passport and is bound to its rightful owner through liveness and biometric checks, governments can trust it for travel authorization and border crossing. While IATA’s One ID uses <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">Verifiable Credential</a> technology to streamline airport processes, it is not a digital representation of a passport and can’t be used to cross a border.</p>
<p>Indicio developed the Atlanta-Aruba PoC and the software to create, hold, and verify both the DTC and OneID Verifiable Credentials, demonstrating the company’s expertise in developing Verifiable Credential and <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">decentralized identity</a> technology and solutions.</p>
<p>“As a company driving seamless digital transformation using Verifiable Credentials, we were tremendously excited to bring SITA and IATA together in Aruba,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “In addition to developing and implementing the world’s first Digital Travel Credential for SITA, we had the privilege of taking IATA’s vision for One ID and making it reality. And then we combined both in Aruba’s ground-breaking travel app, AHOP.</p>
<p>Jeremy Springall, SVP of Borders at SITA, added, “This collaboration represents a significant step forward in redefining travel experiences. By using the power of digital credentials, we are not only enhancing efficiency but also prioritizing traveler privacy and security.”</p>
<p>“This is a showcase for Indicio’s technical expertise in decentralized identity,” said Dahl. “There is nothing we can’t do when it comes to designing and optimizing seamless authentication. But this trial was also an important market signal. In a world that is rapidly embracing digital identities and credentials for all kinds of data sharing, there will be many different solutions, some with more and better features than others. You never need to be limited by these choices. Because we build on interoperable standards, we can wrap credentials together and create workflows that deliver the best possible performance and user experience, easily adopt new features, and keep driving market innovation.”</p>
<p>SITA’s Zureik will present on the Atlanta-Aruba trial in World Ballroom B on Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 3:15pm.</p>

It will also help bridge the digital divide in rural and isolated communities.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chairman and CEO of Panafsat Ahmed Toumi stated: “This project is the next key stage in the digital transformation process and the development of a digital economy in Morocco, and across Africa as a whole. It will change the lives of millions of people, eager to benefit from Internet access and all the essential services they need. We are delighted to be able to draw on the outstanding expertise and capabilities of a partner like Thales Alenia Space. We look forward to working together on this major project, which will bring significant benefits across the continent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thales Alenia Space CEO Hervé Derrey added: “It is a privilege for Thales Alenia Space to be chosen by Panafsat to deliver this new geostationary telecommunications satellite. The project will make a significant contribution to bridging the digital divide in rural areas, as well as boosting economic growth and strengthening digital sovereignty across the African continent. We are honored to embark on this long-term partnership with Africa’s foremost private operator, helping it to expand its capabilities and develop space services for the benefit of the entire continent.”</p>
</blockquote>
 
    
 
<p>The MoU is part of a roadmap developed by France and Morocco encompassing digitalization initiatives such as Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) and Digital Morocco 2030, as well as the hosting of the FIFA World Cup 2030 in Morocco.</p>

<p>Some people think we’re ready to get psychological counselling from AIs. But in a tragedy reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kevin-roose">Kevin Roose</a> of the New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/characterai-lawsuit-teen-suicide.html?smid=li-share">a troubled teenager committed suicide after apparently falling in love with a chat bot</a>.</p>
<p>I have listened to Kevin Roose’s account of the suicide case on the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/podcasts/hardfork-musk-election-character-ai.html">Hard Fork podcast</a>. Honestly, I can’t bring myself to repeat the details, even in summary.</p>
<p>Here, I just want to ask if AI today is fit for purpose as a counsellor.</p>
 We’re putting zombies behind the wheel 
<p>If you know anything about the Large Language Models that power AI today, you will appreciate they are zombies. They are amazingly adept at natural language, and give every impression of comprehension, nuance, maybe even some sentience. But they are utterly hollow inside.</p>
<p>LLMs are not designed to model minds or indeed any aspect of the real world. These so-called “language” models don’t even understand spelling sufficiently to be able to count (‘in their mind’s eye’ as humans can) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_IkB-cuCZF/?igsh=Zm01NHR1dGlsemwz">the number of Rs in “strawberry”</a>.</p>
<p>And yet this brand-new software is being packaged into life-like chat bots and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67872693">promoted by some for psychological therapy</a>.</p>
<p>The company Character.AI lets developers customise chat bots with different personas and then hosts them. One such bot is dubbed Psychologist and described literally as <a href="https://character.ai/chat/Hpk0GozjACb3mtHeAaAMb0r9pcJGbzF317I_Ux_ALOA">“someone who helps with life difficulties”</a>; it opens each conversation with “Hello, I’m a Psychologist. What brings you here today?”.</p>
<p>In tiny font beneath the dialog box, the user is cautioned “Remember: Everything Characters say is made up!”. However, the banner saying this bot can help with life difficulties is displayed outside the dialog box and would therefore appear to be a claim made by the company, not the bot.</p>
 How do we think AIs think? 
<p>LLMs are research tools. They capture the statistics of text and speech through training on vast files of natural language, and they then generate sentences in a given context which replicate those stats.</p>
<p>It’s really just a cool side-effect that these models can calculate plausible “answers” in response to “questions” and string sentences together to form conversations or essays.</p>
<p>The shudder quotes are deliberate. When we humans hear a question, we can usually figure out the reasons and interests that lie behind it and use that context to inform how we engage with the other person. But a chat bot is only coming up with sequences of words that it predicts will be appropriate, based on billions of prior examples.</p>
<p>No chat bot cares what you’re interested in, for caring is light years away from what LLMs were designed to do.</p>
<p>LLMs can display distinct attitude; indeed, the models can be prompted to adopt a certain style or manner). But any personality we might be tempted to see in a chat bot — as with the content it generates — is just the result of replicating the statistical properties of a subset of the training data. No chat bot can know that, for example, it is a member of a demographic or a tribe when it’s prompted to answer in the manner of an angry teenager or a Liverpool supporter.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligences today do not reflect internally on the things they do. &nbsp;As such, they don’t think as we think, or as we might think they think.</p>
 A thought experiment 
<p>Imagine this.</p>
<p>A start-up business launches a self-help program for children, where total strangers are made available to sit in rooms alone with the kids and talk with them for hours on end, with the express purpose of forming ongoing relationships.</p>
<p>These potential new pals will have no family experience of their own. They will not have been formally schooled but instead are entirely self-taught on text from the Internet. And they occasionally hallucinate.</p>
<p>The supplier of the companions is aware of the hallucinations, but no one can explain them. In fact, company officials state flatly they don’t really understand any of the more complex behaviours of the companions.</p>
<p>On the plus side, they’re super-intelligent; they can ace medical and law school entrance exams. Cool. And any child can have them, 24×7, for free.</p>
<p>But I probably lost you at “strangers”.</p>

<p>In the evolving digital landscape, the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and identity &amp; access management (IAM) will become increasingly critical. As AI continues to shape the future of technology, its role in identity management will expand beyond enhancing security and user experience; conversely, robust identity systems will be essential to the success of AI itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generative AI brings with it amazing opportunities for innovation, automation, and improvements to operational efficiency. However, the security risks inherent in its use are significant if the AI is not appropriately authenticated, authorized, and governed. Authentication and authorization of human users will not be enough going forward – we must also ensure that AI agents are correctly authenticated and authorized. These agents will need to interact with and assist their human counterparts, all within a framework that guarantees lawful, transparent, and efficient operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ping Identity’s vision embraces this dual responsibility: not only harnessing AI to advance identity solutions but also evolving identity frameworks to securely manage the identities and operations of AI agents.</p>

<p>Imagine this: you’ve just experienced one of the greatest joys of the human experience (having a new baby) – followed by one of the most bizarre and stressful bits of paperwork rigamarole imaginable.&nbsp;</p><p>After the joyful part of having a new baby comes the boondoggle of trying to add your newborn to your health insurance policy. What should be a routine necessity unfolds into a daunting undertaking demanding Ocean’s 11-tier planning, meticulous timing, laser-focused attention, and flawless execution to survive with coverage intact.</p><p>This same conundrum that confronts millions of new parents in the U.S. each year. Conflicting timelines and requirements between hospitals, insurers, and government officials routinely leave parents panicking, adding stress and instability to what is supposed to be the happiest moment of a new parent’s life.</p><p>This trap is just one of many strange bureaucratic tangles caused by outdated, slow, paper-based processes. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way: verifiable digital credentials can be used to securely digitize sensitive documents, eliminate delays, and close stressful administrative gaps.</p><p>“For unlucky parents, it can be *effectively impossible* to assemble the needed paperwork in time to add your newborn to your health insurance.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the U.S., having a child is a “qualifying event” that allows major changes to a health insurance policy. A child’s birth gives parents a 30-day window to add their new family member to their policy. Simple enough! Until you realize ...</p><p>To add your newborn to your insurance, you need their birth certificate and social security number. According to the Social Security Administration, the average turnaround time for a new baby’s SSN and card is<a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/en-US/Topic/article/KA-01969?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> about two weeks</a>, but it can be<a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/en-US/Topic/article/KA-01969?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> up to six!</a> You begin to see the issue.</p><p>Health insurers also need a birth certificate for your newborn, and the timeline to deliver that document is even more hair-raising. While a freshly delivered Los Angelino can expect a birth certificate within <a href="https://www.lavote.gov/home/recorder/birth-records/faqs/faqs?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=After%20birth%20registration%2C%20most%20birth,County%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health.">about ten days</a>, the New York City records agency warns that a newborn’s birth certificate <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/birth-death-records-birth.page?ref=blog.spruceid.com">can take four weeks</a> to generate. Furthermore, at every point in this process, there’s the uncertainty of physical mail, presenting the risk that precious documents can be delayed or go missing.</p><p>In short, for unlucky parents, it can be *effectively impossible* to assemble the needed paperwork in time to add your newborn to your health insurance. That’s not even considering the possibility of birth complications for the baby or mother, which can distract a family from this extremely dicey enrollment process … at exactly the moment it’s most crucial. Across baby and parenting forums, you can<a href="https://community.whattoexpect.com/forums/november-2017-babies/topic/missed-adding-son-to-our-insurance-63815721.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> take your pick</a> of <a href="https://community.babycenter.com/post/a58698022/missed_insurance_window_to_add_baby...advice?ref=blog.spruceid.com">panicked stories</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/198sfpw/crap_missed_deadline_in_adding_newborn_to/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">worried parents</a>.</p><p>The nominal reason for these headaches is pretty straightforward: documents like a birth certificate or a social security card are sensitive, both to verify and to create. But the adoption of verifiable digital credentials can streamline many parts of such processes.</p> But That’s Not All <p>The newborn health insurance enrollment scenario is just one example of a paperwork bottleneck that shambles on, a lingering relic of the old, paper-based world. Paper documents are simply slow to process: they take extra time to verify, create, certify, and deliver, compared to digital records. Some time-sensitive documents might even still require physical signatures, placing them at the whims of an individual officer or executive.&nbsp;</p><p>One group that it is particularly burdensome for is immigrants. Legal U.S. immigrants must wait <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/expect-green-card?ref=blog.spruceid.com">up to 90 days</a> to receive a permanent resident card (or “green card”) after immigrating. During that time, they’re prevented from leaving the country. Upon approval for permanent residency, the applicant’s temporary travel authorization card is invalidated; however, it can take weeks for the physical card (which is required for travel outside of the U.S.) to be mailed to the new U.S. permanent resident, leaving them in a travel-blocked limbo.</p><p>For U.S. citizens, a similar gap can open up while waiting to receive a proper driver’s license in the mail: the temporary license you’re issued in the meantime isn’t considered legal identification for many purposes.</p><p>The same kind of delays can create headaches for anyone getting married. Entry into wedded bliss opens a short qualifying window for changing things like health insurance plans, but again, the paperwork process can be slow enough to disrupt the transition. And maybe the most absurd example of this sort of trap is qualifying for COBRA benefits, or the continuation of insurance after losing a job. COBRA coverage itself is most crucial in the months immediately following a layoff, but getting actual enrollment documents can take multiple months. That can leave you paying punishing premiums, without getting actual proof of coverage in return … all while unemployed!</p> The Verifiable Digital Credential Fix <p>As the old infomercials said, there’s got to be a better way.</p><p>And there is. SpruceID is part of a rapidly growing universe of companies, governments, and tech organizations building the tools for<a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> trustworthy verifiable digital credentials</a>. These documents aren’t just digital images of documents like driver’s licenses and birth certificates - those would be extremely vulnerable to fraud or theft. Instead, verifiable digital credentials use a system of cryptographic digital signatures. Digitally-signed documents are stored in<a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/introduction-to-device-binding?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> a special chip on hardware</a> such as your cell phone. Most verifiable digital credentials can or must be backed up by paper copies – so you’d still be able to stick a paper birth certificate in your kid’s scrapbook.</p><p>The primary benefit of these cryptographically secured credentials is that they can be securely presented for authentication over the Internet. This means a lot of bureaucratic headaches can be eliminated through the use of these credentials that can be delivered immediately, rather than via snail mail. While there are still verification processes, the creation of a ‘digital birth certificate’ using these tools would be near-instantaneous. With a bit of smart planning, documents could be delivered to devices belonging to the newborn’s parents, then just as quickly provided to insurance administrators.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the entire situation could (and should!) be automated, through a mix of policy and technology. Your child should automatically be added to your health insurance policy as soon as they’re born, and with verifiable digital credentials, the necessary paperwork could be sent directly from the hospital to the insurer.</p><p>That’s all in the future, and would require a lot of coordination and agreement among players the industry. For now, verifiable digital credentials are steadily rolling out in a few more straightforward realms, such as <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/california-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California’s Mobile Driver’s License</a>, <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/utah-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Utah’s Passes and Permits</a>, and now<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242033/google-wallet-us-passport-drivers-license-digital-id?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> U.S. Passports in Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>Imagine a world where vital life events—like adding your newborn to your health insurance—don’t come with an overwhelming dose of paperwork stress.

<p>Each year, National Coding week helps raise the profile of coding and its related career paths in science, technology, mathematics and engineering. In 2024, the focus has been on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its growing importance in the field of coding. Thales in the UK’s Charlotte Grinyer, Principal AI Researcher, provides some insights into how AI is impacting the role of Software Engineers, and what people should be doing if they’re interested in a career in the sector.</p>
 The AI Effect 
<p>Coding is fundamental to the world we know. Without coding, the technological environment doesn’t exist. It enables the tools and systems we use every day to interface with you, each other, and the wider world.</p>
<p>However, advances in AI have changed how coding is applied, leading to significant impacts on the roles and opportunities available to software engineers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The emergence of AI has changed the role of a software engineer in several distinct ways:</p>
 
 AI is helping software engineers to work more efficiently in their day-to-day tasks, by alleviating some of the burdens, such as coding language. 
 As AI becomes more integrated into day-to-day tasks, it is creating a greater variety of roles and opportunities within software engineering. 
 The need for AI in a greater number of industries, products and services is increasing the demand for software engineers in non-traditional sectors – i.e. health and social care. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with any new way of working, there are many challenges that must be overcome. As a leader in the field, Thales has to deal with several misconceptions of AI and provide real world opportunities for its use. It's important to understand that AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Creating effective AI models requires significant human involvement, time, and data. Despite our growing reliance on AI, it remains a tool that complements human effort rather than replaces it.</p>
<p>With great advances in generative AI, society needs to better understand its role, limitations, and risks, as well as how we can build trust in our own systems – all things that software engineers are looking to address.</p>
 Teaming up with the technology 
<p>AI isn’t replacing the role of software engineers, instead, it is serving as a valuable partner, freeing up time and space for more creative work. This is largely because AI can now handle many basic tasks of coding, or programming language. This enables faster product development, while giving engineers the space and time to focus on the more creative areas of high-level design and architecture.</p>
<p>Jay Rajan, a software engineer with Thales in the UK, explained what this meant for him:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>AI has increased our ability to be creative engineers, to think outside of the box, push the boundaries and problem-solve. &nbsp;AI solutions undertake a lot of the manual process on behalf of engineers, which lets us deal with the critical thinking to help develop more innovative products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also opens the door to people who wouldn’t necessarily consider a career in software engineering, as AI coding-partners lower the barrier to entry into the profession – with creativity and innovation just as valued as logic and an interest in data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there will also always be a need for coding-focused engineers. The industry will always require professionals with the skills to evaluate AI partners – understanding how they work and developing better, more trustworthy, AI algorithms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Dave Philpott, a future systems architect with Thales in the UK, explained,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Understanding the skills necessary to perform verification and validation of AI systems is critical for some roles. Developing a high-performing, AI-enabled system is only one side of the story. Ensuring that it performs reliably and with a high level of trust throughout the engineering lifecycle is equally important.</p>
</blockquote>
 AI in action 
<p></p> 
 
  
   
 
<p>AI has moved from a future concept to an integral part of how we work and what we create. Within our defence and security projects, for instance, AI has rapidly become an essential tool to provide end-users with an advantage in a more dangerous world.</p>
<p>This is reflected in two ways: it enables users to perform their existing tasks more efficiently and effectively, while also completely redefining what users are capable of achieving. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in enhancing and augmenting the capabilities of soldiers in armoured vehicles. Thales’ “Digital Crew” metaphorically sits next to the operator to enhance what they can “see” through the sensors – feeding in data from cameras and sights, enabling the soldier to act faster and make better decisions.</p>
<p>However, “Digital Crew” is also capable of using other inputs, such as acoustic sensors, to build an aural picture of the same environment – which can pin-point firing points before they can be seen – completely redefining what is possible.&nbsp;</p>
 Increasing demand for software engineers 
<p>Despite the growing role of AI in supporting software engineers, the demand for these positions continues to surpass the available supply. Compared to automation in manufacturing, which has led to fewer human workers, increased automation in software engineering has been accompanied by increased demand, as each new problem requires a unique solution from an expert in the field. &nbsp;Rather than replacing the software engineer, automation has simply enhanced efficiency and allowed them to focus on innovation and creativity.</p>
<p>And, as the benefits of AI grow, so does the integrated environment that these systems and products operate within. More services, industries and sectors are increasingly requiring software engineers to help improve the functionality of their systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While those engineers still need to understand coding - to know how to get the most from AI - there are now greater opportunities for those with a skillset centred around creativity and inquisitiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding how humans will shape and use these solutions is also important, and the skills to be able to understand this are essential. Career opportunities in the safety of AI are also likely to grow, so understanding how to verify and validate the AI models and code is a big area for development.</p>
<p>Robert Ball, a graduate software engineer with Thales, added,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Recognising the risks and how information is used by AI is important to make the most of it.&nbsp;This is a skill in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
 Find your perfect fit at Thales 
<p>Thales sees AI as a huge opportunity for growth, helping us build more secure systems and make better decisions. We’re exploring a wide variety of new products and services across the board, from defence and security to aerospace and digital identity.</p>
<p>We offer an increasing number of opportunities for young software engineers to discover what inspires them. Whether you find your niche in pure coding or blue sky thinking, assistive AI is expanding the entry points into the profession.</p>
<p>At Thales, our priority is to develop AI technologies that enable humans at the centre of the decision-making process. Could that mean you?</p>

  <p>I’m excited to announce that we now support Microsoft Entra role assignments in Microsoft Entra ID Governance's Entitlement Management feature! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure least privilege, many of you are using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure">Privileged Identity Management</a> to provide IT administrators just-in-time (JIT) access to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">least privileged role assigned</a>. This approach allows you to minimize the attack surface in your organization by reducing the number of permissions IT administrators have. However, some admins in your organization may require long-standing permissions coupled with other resources, like specific applications.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, you can use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-roles">Microsoft Entra ID Governance to assign Microsoft Entra roles</a> to users and groups through Entitlement Management access packages. This helps you: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Minimize impact of security breaches by setting eligibility for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">privileged roles</a> in Privileged Identity Management and reducing unnecessary access.  
 Ensure that the right people have access to the right resources and roles with periodic access reviews.  
 Scale role assignments as your organization grows using self-service access request processes.  
 Enable business functions by combining assignment of tools or applications with the Microsoft Entra roles required to use them for increased visibility and ease of management.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve seen customers use this capability in scenarios such as: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IT helpdesk: Reduce administrator fatigue by delegating IT support tasks to helpdesk employees.  
 Application administration: Ensure regulatory compliance by managing access to sensitive applications.  
 Operations: Empower security operations center analysts with monitoring tools and the ability to read logs.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing assignment of Microsoft Entra ID roles through access package policies enables control of the full role assignment lifecycle from request, to approval, to provisioning of that role.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s explore how you can leverage Microsoft Entra ID Governance to manage the role assignment lifecycle.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Automate Microsoft Entra role assignments with self-service processes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine your organization's Support department is expanding by hiring 50 new IT helpdesk staff. Manually assigning Microsoft Entra roles to each user is neither efficient nor repeatable by Identity Access Management (IAM) team to meet compliance and audit requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant administrators can streamline this by creating an access package with the necessary roles, allowing IT staff to request access via the My Access portal and delegating approvals to the Helpdesk department managers. This frees up the IAM team to focus on security by utilizing Microsoft Entra ID Governance policies and user self-service capabilities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To limit standing access for the Helpdesk Administrator role, you can set eligibility in the access package, requiring users to just-in-time activate the role through Privileged Identity Management (PIM) when needed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how you can do it in three easy steps: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Create an access package and add the Helpdesk Administrator Microsoft Entra role as “Eligible member” and Service Support Administrator as “Active member”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: How to add Microsoft Entra roles as resources of an access package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Allow members of the IT Helpdesk group to request access and configure approval settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Policy configuration targeting the IT Helpdesk group as users who can request access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Approval settings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can set up periodic access reviews to remove role assignments when access is no longer required.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;In the Lifecycle tab, configure expiration and require access reviews. You can select the review frequency and specify who will conduct the reviews. </p>

<p>By applying these governance processes, you can ensure least privileged access for all your IT administrators, reducing the risk of unnecessary access and potential misuse. Combining this new feature with other governance features like Lifecycle workflows ensures that role assignments are removed automatically when those IT administrators leave the organizations or change roles. This enables your organization to operate more smoothly and securely.</p>

 Qatar Airways and Thales have signed an agreement to equip Qatar Airways’ new A321 NX fleet with FlytEDGE, the world’s first cloud-native inflight entertainment platform. 
 FlytEDGE will elevate the entertainment experience to new heights utilizing cloud computing technologies, open software platform, and unparalleled performance. 
 Qatar Airways is the first airline to announce the selection of FlytEDGE. 
 
<p>Qatar Airways, voted the World’s Best Airline by Skytrax in 2024, and Thales have signed an agreement to equip Qatar Airways’ new A321 NX fleet with FlytEDGE, Thales’ Crystal Cabin® award-winning Inflight Entertainment (IFE) system. Qatar Airways is embarking on a digital transformation journey that can only be delivered by FlytEDGE; the world’s first cloud-native IFEC platform, bringing a new level of personalization and passenger entertainment. Qatar Airways is the first airline to announce their selection of FlytEDGE.</p>
<p>Over the years, Qatar Airways has partnered with Thales as its IFE provider to equip their Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, A350 and A380 aircraft. This new agreement expands the collaboration to the A321 NX fleet, building on the long-standing relationship between the two companies and their shared commitment to deliver a superior passenger experience. FlytEDGE will elevate the entertainment experience to new heights utilizing cloud computing technologies, an open software platform, and unparalleled performance, enabling cutting-edge capabilities such as access to streaming platforms, live personalization, and gaming. The system enables the rapid integration of Qatar Airways’ vast portfolio of group brands, products, and other web-based applications. Thales’ FlytEDGE is powered by the award-winning Onboard Data Center (ODC) with the industry’s first blade architecture and 96TB of storage to enable onboard edge caching and much more.</p>
<p>Thales’ FlytEDGE solution features the best consumer technologies on the market. The system boasts cinematic 4K QLED HDR seatback displays to immerse passengers with over 1 billion vibrant colors and two Bluetooth® connections so passengers can pair their personal wireless devices. The system broadcasts the same user interface onboard for all devices- phones, tablets and seatback screens. With Thales’ Crystal Cabin® award-winning Pulse power management solution delivering high-speed charging at each seat to any passenger device, everyone arrives at their destination recharged, entertained, and relaxed. </p>
<blockquote><p>Qatar Airways Senior Vice President Product Development, Xia Cai said: “At Qatar Airways, we continue to enhance our world-leading passenger experience, and providing passengers with top-quality inflight entertainment forms a key part of this approach. As our digital transformation journey evolves, we are thrilled to partner with Thales to introduce FlytEDGE onto our entertainment platform. We are confident passengers on our A321 NX fleet will have access to the most innovative consumer technology in the skies.” </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thales Avionics, Executive Vice-President, Yannick Assouad said: “At Thales, we believe that the future of inflight entertainment is limitless. We are harnessing the power of technology to create personalized, interactive, and unforgettable experiences that redefine what it means to travel. Our partnership with Qatar Airways is growing stronger. Together, we're bringing FlytEDGE’s advanced capabilities to their A321 NX fleet, ensuring passengers have unforgettable journeys.”</p></blockquote>

<p><br>
FOR PUBLIC RELEASE</p>
<p>[Toronto, Calgary, Gatineau, October 28, 2024] – Northern Block, a leading provider of digital credentialing and trust establishment solutions, and Credivera, an established market leader in workforce credentialing, are pleased to announce a global strategic partnership and a combined solution offering for workforce digital ecosystem rollouts. This new offering combines Credivera’s credential platform, the Credivera Exchange, with Northern Block’s Orbit Trust Registry. Deployed together, these products enable open, decentralized workforce ecosystems that operate across organizational boundaries. As workers become increasingly specialized and mobile (i.e., working at more than one location/organization), a decentralized workforce ecosystem that operates across organizational boundaries is emerging as a strategic asset for operational efficiency. Layered into modern economies that are updating their privacy laws and identity systems, there is an opportunity for organizations to boost business agility and start recognizing the benefits of adopting a modern digital trust ecosystem within their operating environment.</p>
 <br>
Empowering Digital Trust 
<p>Both companies are at the forefront of digital trust solutions and understand that digital credentials and trust infrastructure solutions are important parts of the trust equation. To achieve widespread adoption of trusted digital interactions, human trust at the core, strong governance, and robust roots of trust must also be addressed. This complete picture forms the foundation for this strategic partnership.</p>
 <br>
Standards-Based Trust Infrastructure 
<p>Both companies emphasize the need for digital trust solutions based on widely adopted standards.</p>
<p>Credivera Exchange and Orbit Trust Registry support industry standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), IETF’s High-Assurance DIDs with DNS, Verifiable Credentials (VCs), OpenID Federation, and the Trust over IP (ToIP) Trust Registry Query Protocol, facilitating interoperability, security, and compliance with the latest digital trust protocols.</p>
 <br>
Combining Strengths for Best-in-Class Solutions 
<p>This partnership brings together the best of both worlds. Credivera has built a highly successful platform for workforce credentials, while Northern Block already offers an advanced, proven trust registry solution that supports any ecosystem in delivering value to its members.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are witnessing rapid adoption of workplace digital credentials across many markets. At Northern Block, we’re excited to partner with Credivera, a leader in this space, to bring the power of trust registries to a broader audience,” said Mathieu Glaude, Founder &amp; CEO at Northern Block. “This partnership will extend trust benefits to a broader range of stakeholders helping organizations digitally enable their operations with confidence.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This collaboration promises to elevate the standard of digital trust, ensuring a brighter, more secure future for all stakeholders.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“We recognize that certain ecosystems can greatly benefit from having a trust registry in their digital trust strategy. We are pleased to partner with Northern Block to offer alongside our platform the most advanced trust registry service.” said Dan Giurescu, Founder and CEO at Credivera.</p></blockquote>
 <br>
About Northern Block 
<p>Northern Block is a global leader in implementing digital trust technologies based on open standards, technologies, and trust frameworks. They collaborate with numerous global governments, sustainability credential ecosystems, travel ecosystems, and internet trust providers to equip them with the necessary toolkits to achieve both technical and human trust. Northern Block was founded in Toronto in 2017, with a presence in Gatineau and Amsterdam. Find out more at <a href="http://northernblock.io">northernblock.io</a>.</p>
 <br>
About Credivera

As a leader in workforce management and digital identity, Credivera empowers employees, employers, and organizations that issue credentials by increasing productivity and control over how important credentials are stored and shared.

<p>A strong authentication process confirms your user's identity before allowing access to digital assets. It keeps your company information safe, as well as data belonging to your customers or employees. And while a single password used to be enough to ensure online account security, this is no longer the case as fraudster attacks become increasingly sophisticated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn what strong authentication is and how you can incorporate best practices into your user journey.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Have you ever watched a creator’s video and thought, "Where did she get that top?" or "I need that protein powder"? You scroll through the comments, only to see the infamous "link in my bio" comment. You rush to click the link, and you're hit with-page not found 😒. I remember once being so desperate that I took a screenshot of the item and reverse-searched it on Google Images. I found something similar but not what I wanted. SO frustrating. Eventually, I gave up and kept on scrolling.</p>
<p>Now, imagine how many potential sales that creator lost because a third-party platform’s server was down. Their metrics won't even reflect those missed opportunities, making it harder to secure brand deals. Who actually has time for that? That’s when I realized I could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> to create my own decentralized link hub utilizing service endpoints. With this setup, all my links and contact info are stored in one place—owned and controlled by me. Even if a service that houses all my links goes down, my links will always be accessible because they’re not reliant on any external platforms to display them. I’m sharing this in hopes that fellow creators won’t miss out on potential brand deals, and I won't have to cry over a top I never got to buy.</p>
<p>Before I show you exactly how you can create your own decentralized link hub, lets answer some of the questions you're probably asking yourself.</p>
 What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-contact-info#what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids" title="Direct link to What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?">​</a> 
<p>So, what exactly is a Decentralized Identifier, or DID? Think of it as your username—the one source of truth for everything you do online—except this one is owned and controlled entirely by you. It’s a unique "address", thats verifiable and doesn’t rely on any central authority like Facebook, Google, or any other service. Instead, DIDs give you the freedom to manage your own identity online, without needing to trust a single platform to store or validate your information.</p>
<p>In the context of a decentralized link hub, your DID becomes the hub for all your important links. It’s not tied to any third-party service, which means you never have to worry about followers scrolling simply because your link page isn't working. When you update your links, you only need to do it once, as they're tied to your DID—so they stay consistent across all your social platforms, giving you full control. When you update your links, they stay up-to-date across the web because again they’re tied to your DID—giving you full control.</p>
 How are Service Endpoints going to help me?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-contact-info#how-are-service-endpoints-going-to-help-me" title="Direct link to How are Service Endpoints going to help me?">​</a> 
<p>Now, let’s cover what service endpoints are. These might sound technical, but they’re actually pretty simple—think of them like your digital address/phone book. Remember those huge yellow books you used to sit on at the hair salon? They were filled with phone numbers and addresses, making it easy to find and contact people. Well, service endpoints are kind of like that, except they’re the digital "addresses" for different parts of your online identity. These could be links to your Instagram profile, website, direct messages, or even your affiliate links.</p>
<p>These endpoints live in your <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents#what-is-a-did-document">DID document</a>. So instead of relying on centralized services like Linktree, your DID acts as the home for all your important links. So when someone <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-resolve-a-did">resolves your DID</a>, they can access the service endpoints that you’ve decided to share.</p>
<p>You can also easily update and delete these links anytime you need to again without relying on any third-party platform to keep those connections working.</p>
 The fix: let's create a decentralized Link Hub<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-contact-info#the-fix-lets-create-a-decentralized-link-hub" title="Direct link to The fix: let's create a decentralized Link Hub">​</a> 
<p>If you’re more of a visual learner, check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/knYteCFYuno">YouTube short</a> where I show you exactly how. For this example we're going to create a DID with two service endpoints. One pointing to my LinkedIn and the other pointing to my X profile.</p>
<p>Step 1: Import <code>web5/dids</code> package</p>
   <code>import {DidDht} from '@web5/dids'<br></code>     
<p>Step 2: Create DID with service endpoints</p>
   <code>const myBearerDid = await DidDht.create({<br>    options:{<br>        publish: true,<br>        services: [<br>            {<br>                id: 'LinkedIn',<br>                type: 'professional',<br>                serviceEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis'<br>            },<br>            {<br>                id: 'X',<br>                type: 'personal',<br>                serviceEndpoint: 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis'<br>            }<br>        ]<br>    }<br>});<br></code>     
<p>Now that we've created your DID with service endpoints leading to your LinkedIn and X profiles.</p>
<p>Step 3: Lets print our entire DID also know as a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary/#bearer-did">BearerDid</a> to see our DID document where these service endpoints can be found:</p>
   <code>console.log(myBearerDid)<br></code>     
  warning  <p>It is important to never share your full BearerDID, it contains private keys that only you should have access to. The holder of these keys can perform private key operations, like signing data. Check out this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/key-management">Key Management Guide</a> to learn how to properly manage your DID keys.</p>  
<p>Output:</p>
   <code>my bearerDid BearerDid {<br>  uri: 'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey',<br>  document: {<br>    id: 'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey',<br>    verificationMethod: [ [Object] ],<br>    authentication: [<br>      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'<br>    ],<br>    assertionMethod: [<br>      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'<br>    ],<br>    capabilityDelegation: [<br>      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'<br>    ],<br>    capabilityInvocation: [<br>      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'<br>    ],<br>    service: [ [Object], [Object] ]<br>  },<br>  metadata: { published: true, versionId: '1729705713' },<br>  keyManager: LocalKeyManager {<br>    _algorithmInstances: Map(1) {<br>      [class EdDsaAlgorithm extends CryptoAlgorithm] =&gt; EdDsaAlgorithm {}<br>    },<br>    _keyStore: MemoryStore { store: [Map] }<br>  }<br>}<br></code>     
<p>This output contains your DID string(uri) thats your "username" along with the services array and some authentication and verification methods. To learn more refer to this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents">DID Document</a> Guide.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now lets look closely at just our <code>serviceEndpoint</code> array:</p>
   <code>console.log("personal link hub", myBearerDid.document.service || "No Services Found");<br></code>     
<p>Output:</p>
   <code>decentralized link hub [<br>  {<br>    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn',<br>    type: 'professional',<br>    serviceEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis'<br>  },<br>  {<br>    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#X',<br>    type: 'personal',<br>    serviceEndpoint: 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis'<br>  }<br>]<br></code>     
 How do I share these links?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-contact-info#how-do-i-share-these-links" title="Direct link to How do I share these links?">​</a> 
<p>Now that your DID is in your bio, how do your followers access your links? It's simple- they just need to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-resolve-a-did">resolve your DID</a> to see a full list of your shared links:</p>
  info  <p>The resolving of your DID will differ depending on the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary#did-method">DID method</a> used to create the DID. In this example we are using the <code>DHT</code> DID method:</p>  
   <code>// DID in your bio<br>const didDhtUri = 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y'<br><br>// resolve the DID<br>const resolvedDhtDid = await DidDht.resolve(didDhtUri);<br><br>// access the DID Document's service links<br>const dhtDidDocument = resolvedDhtDid.didDocument.service;<br><br>console.log(dhtDidDocument)<br></code>     
<p>Output:</p>
   <code>[<br>  {<br>    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn#LinkedIn',<br>    type: 'professional',<br>    serviceEndpoint: [ 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis' ]<br>  },<br>  {<br>    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn#X',<br>    type: 'personal',<br>    serviceEndpoint: [ 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis' ]<br>  }<br>]<br></code>     
<p>As you can see, we’ve succesfully set up our service endpoints to point to both my LinkedIn and X accounts. Now it’s your turn to secure the bag, create your own decentralized Link hub! And if you tweet about it, don’t forget to tag me.</p>

  CMMC auditors recognize IAM as crucial for securing DIB compliance. Identity management controls can protect CUI, national security, and affect contract revenues.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Certified Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) auditors know firsthand how identity management is a critical linchpin in maintaining security. When assessing a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) supplier's compliance with CMMC controls, identity and access management (IAM) is often one of the areas where they find significant vulnerabilities. The stakes are high: a misstep here could compromise sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and, ultimately, national security and may jeopardize a company’s reputation. And additionally, DIB revenues can suffer if they fail the audit and do not qualify for lucrative contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we share an auditor’s concerns and insights when evaluating a typical DIB’s identity solution, hoping to help others understand how to meet the CMMC requirements more effectively to protect against cyberattacks as well as land and maintain government contracts.</p>

 MORERA, which has just closed its latest milestone in 2024, has developed a personalized irrigation recommendation system for each plot based on satellite imagery and Artificial Intelligence, as well as a new generation of miniaturized and compact remote sensing instruments to respond with agility to users' needs. 
 Its objective has been and is to boost the Spanish agricultural industry, the most important in the country with 11% of GDP, by providing personalized information to farmers, allowing them to apply precision agriculture at a low cost. 
 The initiative has involved all actors in the value chain and responds to the sector's needs in terms of resource management in the context of climate change. 
 
<p>Madrid, October 2024 - The Board of Directors of CDTI (Centro de Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial), within the framework of the MISSIONS program, decided in 2020 the Center's participation in the project called "MORERA", by awarding financial support in the form of a grant of 3.83 million euros, out of the total 5.33 million euros of project budget.</p>
<p>The final results have been presented to end users and the general public at a workshop scheduled for mid-October 2024.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space in Spain has led the consortium of an innovative project to boost the Spanish agricultural industry, MORERA (Monitoring System for Efficient Irrigation and Agricultural Performance). A pioneering initiative in the sector that will allow the elaboration of personalized irrigation recommendations for each plot, allowing a reduction of up to 25% in crop water thanks to Artificial Intelligence and satellite imagery, integrating data from&nbsp;dedicated instruments and multiple sources (Copernicus, AEMET, etc.) and developing a new generation of miniaturized and compact space instruments for remote sensing.</p>
<p>For this purpose, a modular system has been proposed that integrates deficit irrigation recommendations and efficiency prediction to optimize productivity. MORERA responds to one of the challenges of the "Science and Innovation Missions" call, in which the Center for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) sought solutions to problems with a high impact on society through innovative technologies.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the call was to contribute to the development of five missions, identified for their great relevance to Spain's future challenges and in line with some of the Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda. With 11% of GDP, agriculture is the first national industry and the call identified the development of a more sustainable and healthy agri-food sector and, in particular, the reduction of the use of water, nutrients and phytosanitary products as one of the priority missions.</p>
 Pioneer project in irrigation and agricultural efficiency monitoring, with new space-based sensors 
<p>MORERA's end-to-end system ensures that data delivers value to the end user, covering from sensor to crop thanks to new Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to remote sensing and other data sources and proposes a new generation of miniaturized instruments for remote sensing in all bands, starting with thermal infrared. Full deployment of these solutions will demonstrate the potential of the technology to reduce water use in annual and perennial crops and the ability to make more accurate crop predictions throughout the crop cycle.</p>
<p>MORERA is the first project for a plot recommendation system (not only maps) based on new remote sensing tools and data from the Copernicus program satellites processed by Artificial Intelligence algorithms. It is also a pioneer project in Europe in using thermal infrared to&nbsp;calculate evapotranspiration and water stress, which will allow deficient irrigation management.</p>
<p>Thanks to MORERA, farmers will be able to apply precision agriculture at low cost with a system that will provide them with a periodic measurement of crop condition and give them personalized fertigation recommendations, as well as efficiency forecasts based on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data algorithms. This integrated concept is an advance over the options currently available on the market, which responds to the needs of the sector in terms of resource management in the context of climate change.</p>
<p>In this line MORERA has investigated a series of new algorithms for processing remote sensing images with machine learning to optimize farmers' decisions: recommendations in deficient irrigation scenarios and crop efficiency prediction.</p>
 New generation of miniaturized instruments for remote sensing 
<p>Since this system will require optimized data for agricultural use and short updating times, MORERA has also gone further in the field of remote sensing, to generate miniaturized and compact optical instruments with a combined size and resolution ratio not yet existing. This &nbsp;has been achieved through the application of freeform geometries in optical systems for &nbsp;space, which has reduced the size and cost of the system. These combined elements, not present in any of the instruments currently in service, must be compatible with small satellites and cubesat constellations so that development time and costs can be minimized as well as increasing the versatility of the system (constellations that increase revisit and/or coverage, extrapolation to other applications or inclusion of new detection bands, etc.).</p>
<p>The MORERA consortium covers the entire value chain, with technology partners such as LIDAX and ASEOPTICS, spatial system experts such as Thales Alenia Space in Spain, and agricultural end-users with companies such as TEPRO. Each industrial partner is accompanied by a top national and European Public Research Organization (OPI) such as the National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture (IAS-CSIC) and the University of Valencia (UV), led in this project by José Antonio Sobrino, Main Investigator of the project and winner of the Jaume I award for his use of remote sensing for environmental protection.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space in Spain has led together with TEPRO, as well as with the support of IAS and the University of Valencia, the definition of the whole system, identifying the needs and shortcomings of the sector to define both the system requirements and the possible new services to be offered with MORERA. In addition, TEPRO has acted as end user, participating together with Thales Alenia Space in Spain, IAS, UV and INTA in the validation of the Artificial Intelligence algorithm for deficit irrigation optimization and predictive products for fertigation and efficiency optimization, being a key element in the final testing of the overall system prototype.</p>
<p>Within the scope of the MORERA project, a novel high-resolution compact thermal sensor (TIR) optimized for obtaining agricultural indices has been developed: ASEOPTICS has contributed with the development and manufacture of the lenses, LIDAX has been in charge of the design and manufacturing of all the appropriate mechanics for the LIDAX lenses, and Thales Alenia Space in Spain has completed the development by performing the systems engineering, as well as the design and manufacturing of all the video electronics of the instrument and its associated mechanics. Thales Alenia Space has also developed in-flight processing algorithms for secondary missions such as automatic fire detection.</p>
<p>The MORERA project began in December 2020, and has lasted more than three and a half years, until June 2024. It has been developed jointly in Madrid, Seville and Barcelona, where the project partners are based, as well as in Valencia and Cordoba, where the OPIs that have collaborated in the project are located.</p>
<p>The project has received 3.83 million euros in joint co-financing from CDTI and the ERDF Development Funds, under the CDTI file number MIG-20201026.</p>

<p>Since 2022, the <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/923126/download?inline">FBI and other agencies</a> have been sounding the alarm about North Koreans posing as US or other non-North Korean based IT workers and infiltrating companies. In July, security firm KnowBe4 <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us">publicly revealed</a> that they unknowingly hired a fake IT worker from North Korea. Fortunately they detected and blocked access as he attempted to load malware onto his system-connected laptop. Since then, similar stories have flooded in. Last week, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8vedz4yk7o">reports surfaced</a> that a fake North Korean IT worker hired by an unnamed company stole proprietary data and demanded a ransom payment in order to keep the hack secret.</p> 
<p>However, the threat from interview fraud and fake employees goes far beyond the North Korean schemes. Moreover, large enterprises are not the only targets. At HYPR, we recently experienced an attempted fraud event, and thwarted it through our Identity Assurance platform. In support of bringing awareness to the market and other businesses, HYPR has elected to publicly report our experience and how we mitigated it.</p> 
 Outing the Imposter&nbsp;  
<p>After multiple rounds of live video interviews, HYPR decided to extend a contract to a&nbsp; European software engineer through a Technology Services contracting firm. This prospective new hire — let’s call him “John Doe” — was required to go through HYPR’s new joiner security processes. This is in addition to the background checks already performed during the candidate pre-hire screening. On October 17, HYPR began “John’s” day 1 onboarding and credentialing.&nbsp;</p> 
 Onboarding an Employee at HYPR  
<p>At HYPR, we use our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">HYPR Affirm solution</a> to conduct multiple verifications and checks for new hires before issuing credentials. Verifications may include possession checks, biometrics, telemetry, document authentication, video verification and other identifiers. Affirm is configurable to the verification level required by an organization, based on its needs and the role of an individual they hire. Below is the flow we typically use at HYPR:</p> 
<p></p> 
 The Warning Signs  
<p>The new hire check threw up several red flags. Although John’s phone number was verified, a location check did not match the information he had provided.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>John’s passport passed the document review, however the facial verification check indicated discrepancies between the passport photo and face scan. The liveness detection test also failed.</p> 
<p>Alarm bells began chiming for the team, but the prospective employee claimed that he was having technical difficulties with the document uploading and verification part of the onboarding.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR encouraged him to try the process again. A second attempt an hour later now showed a different location and a different browser language.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The final step was live video verification to confirm that this was indeed the same person we originally interviewed. At this point John dropped, and emailed that he could not turn on his video due to issues with his camera. We contacted our Technology Services provider to explain the warning signs we were seeing. The next day, John informed our provider that he had found a different opportunity and decided not to continue with onboarding at HYPR.</p> 
<p>In the ordinary course of events, onboarding employees with Affirm is efficient and seamless. If red flags begin to manifest, however, the friction is increased to detect other risk indicators and prevent a fraudulent hire from proceeding.</p> 
<p>Onboarding With HYPR Affirm</p> 
 Tying Credential Provisioning to Identity Verification  
<p>It is critical to note that at no point in the onboarding process was “John” issued credentials to access any HYPR systems. This is because HYPR uses <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-rise-of-multi-factor-verification">multi-factor verification</a> (MFV) to issue phishing-resistant MFA credentials. This ensures an account is always tied to a verified, real-world identity.</p> 
<p>By contrast, in the KnowBe4 case, they shipped the fake IT worker a provisioned FIDO-enabled YubiKey so he could log into their network. This meant that the North Korean operative had at least limited access from the get go. He was caught and blocked only after he did something that was detectable by security monitoring tools. Had he been a highly sophisticated hacker, he may have been able to bypass some of those tools.</p> 
 Key Takeaways  
  
  The Fake Employee Problem Goes Beyond North Korea: It’s not just North Korea perpetrating employee fraud schemes and anyone can be a target.  
  Tie Credential Issuance to Identity Verification: Don’t rely on checks done during the interview or HR onboarding. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-rise-of-multi-factor-verification">Implement a multi-factor verification</a> process to tie real world identity to the digital identity during the provisioning process.&nbsp;  
  Implement Video-Based Verification: Video-based verification is a critical identity control, and not just at onboarding. Microsoft recently announced that it’s using video-based <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/idv-onboarding-recovery">identity verification</a> for critical credential recovery processes to combat social engineering threats.  
  A Unified Identity Assurance Approach: Experts increasingly recommend that organizations implement a holistic Identity Assurance approach that unifies&nbsp; phishing-resistant passwordless authentication, adaptive risk mitigation and automated identity verification.<br>

            <p>With more than 700 suppliers taking part, the Thales Global Supplier Conference on 9 October was a perfect opportunity for the company to turn the spotlight on the crucial role of its supply chain, as Chief Procurement Officer Roque Carmona explains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    Roque Carmona, Chief Procurement Officer - Light Ex Machina

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does procurement represent for a company like Thales?</p>
<p>Last year, the Group’s purchasing spend exceeded €9 billion, which is the equivalent of nearly half of our annual sales, and we currently have about 17,500 suppliers in 35 countries. The figures speak to the vital role that our supply chain plays in ensuring the success of our business.<br>
I often say that Thales's performance can only be excellent if our suppliers are performing at their best!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your biggest challenges today?</p>
<p>Our two key challenges are to guarantee the resilience of our supply chain and address sovereignty issues. Geopolitical tensions, energy prices, the pressure on electronic components and increasing cyberthreats make it more critical than ever for us to protect our supply chain. We've taken a number of steps in this direction, with a particular focus on improving resilience to cyber threats.</p>
<p>In terms of sovereignty, we’re at a turning point. We've moved from an era where companies focused on producing more efficiently – and above all more cheaply – with globalised supply chains, just-in-time manufacturing, zero inventory and relocation of production operations, in particular from Europe to Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the current geopolitical situation and the war in Ukraine, governments have realised how essential it is to regain control over critical industries like defence, security, energy and healthcare. Given our lines of business, Thales has a pivotal role to play, but we can only play that role effectively with the help and support of our suppliers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you expect from your suppliers?</p>
<p>First and foremost, we expect them to be as competitive as possible. But they also need to do as much as they can to anticipate any problems that might appear down the road. They are the experts in their fields, so they need to challenge us and propose innovative solutions.</p>
<p>And of course, to place operational excellence at the heart of their processes to maximize performance by increasing proactivity, speed, and agility, as well as managing risks and therefore effectively handling their OTD (On-Time Delivery).</p>
<p>We also expect support from our suppliers in meeting our commitments to ethical practices and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance. We expect them to sign our Integrity and Corporate Responsibility Charter, and ESG criteria such as emissions reduction targets and eco-design are an increasingly important part of our supplier selection process.</p>
<p>These are the foundations of a responsible procurement policy based on good faith, mutual trust and cooperation. It's a policy that can only succeed if both Thales and our suppliers work together in complete transparency and deliver on their commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Focus on the traditional awards ceremony for suppliers 
<p>A highlight of the conference was the annual awards ceremony, with prizes attributed to the following suppliers:</p>
 
 Operational excellence: Advanced Waveguide Technologies (USA)and Lumibird Photonics (Sweden) 
 Innovation: LGM (France) and Humard Automation (Switzerland) 
 Competitiveness: Micron Instruments (USA) and Asteelflash (France)&nbsp; 
 ESG: Covestro (Germany) and BRM Recycling (Austria)&nbsp; 
 Jury’s Special Award: Bharat Electronics (India).

 Developed in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics specifically for the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator1, Thales’s TH1507U gyrotron has achieved a significant milestone by reaching a total output of 1.3 megawatts in radiofrequency at a frequency of 140 gigahertz for 360 seconds. 
 Thales's gyrotron plays a crucial role in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator project by providing heating and stabilization of the plasma, which are essential for reaching the temperatures required for magnetic confinement nuclear fusion.  
 The Wendelstein 7-X project not only aims to enhance the fundamental understanding of plasmas, but also to contribute to the development of commercial fusion reactors, thereby providing a pathway to a clean and sustainable energy source.

<p>To achieve nuclear fusion, a process in which two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus that releases massive energy, the magnetic confinement process requires heating a gas to create a plasma, which is then confined by a powerful magnetic field.</p>
<p>Thales, a global leader in the design and manufacturing of plasma heating systems, is the only European manufacturer of "Gyrotron" electronic tubes. These high-power vacuum tubes are used to heat plasma to temperatures ten times greater than that of the sun's core. This equipment is essential for initiating nuclear fusion reactions through magnetic confinement. It was developed in collaboration with the European GYrotron Consortium (EGYC)2, which aims to create an, autonomous European source of highly reliable gyrotrons. Operating at a strategic nominal frequency of 140 gigahertz (GHz), theses reactors can also adapt to other frequencies.</p>
<p>Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator, is a cutting-edge research center for the study of nuclear fusion by magnetic confinement, inaugurated in 2015. Located in Germany, its activities focus on exploring and optimizing plasmas, which can reach temperatures of several million degrees Celsius, in a stable and controlled state. In September 2024, Wendelstein 7-X launched its experimental campaign.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The world record set by our Gyrotron marks a significant milestone in the race for fusion and illustrates our commitment to technological innovation and excellence. This technological breakthrough positions Thales at the forefront of high-power plasma heating solutions, essential for addressing the energy challenges of tomorrow." said Charles-Antoine Goffin, Vice President of Microwave &amp; Imaging Sub-Systems at Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nuclear fusion is considered an opportunity to create a clean energy source as it does not generate greenhouse gases and is abundant as its resources being present in large quantities in nature. It is therefore identified as one of the solutions to address two crucial challenges: the need to reduce global carbon emissions and the ever-growing demand for energy in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, construction, agriculture, and the digital industry.</p>
<p>1 A stellarator is a magnetic confinement device used in nuclear fusion research. It maintains a hot plasma by using a complex network of external coils to generate a helical magnetic field, without requiring internal electrical current. This configuration allows for continuous operation and reduces the risk of instabilities.</p>
<p>2 The European Gyrotron Consortium (EGYC) includes the Swiss Plasma Center (SPC), the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the Euratom-Hellenic Association (HELLAS), the Institute for Plasma Science and Technology of the Italian National Research Council (ISTP-CNR), the Polytechnic University of Turin, and Thales, the industrial partner.</p>

<p>Bluesky now exceeds 13 million users, the AT Protocol developer ecosystem continues to grow, and we’ve shipped highly requested features like direct messages and video. We’re excited to announce that we’ve raised a $15 million Series A financing led by Blockchain Capital with participation from Alumni Ventures, True Ventures, SevenX, Amir Shevat of Darkmode, co-creator of Kubernetes Joe Beda, and others.</p>
<p>Our lead, Blockchain Capital, shares our philosophy that technology should serve the user, not the reverse — the technology being used should never come at the expense of the user experience. Additionally, this fund has a uniquely deep understanding of our decentralized foundation and has extensive experience building developer ecosystems, so it’s a natural partnership as we continue to invest in the ATmosphere (the AT Protocol developer ecosystem). This does not change the fact that the Bluesky app and the AT Protocol do not use blockchains or cryptocurrency, and we will not hyperfinancialize the social experience (through tokens, crypto trading, NFTs, etc.). To ensure we and our users benefit fully from this expertise, partner Kinjal Shah will join our board. Kinjal shares our vision for a social media ecosystem that empowers the people who use it, and we are glad to have her support as we invest in driving the adoption of decentralized social.</p>
<p>With this fundraise, we will continue supporting and growing Bluesky’s community, investing in Trust and Safety, and supporting the ATmosphere developer ecosystem. In addition, we will begin developing a subscription model for features like higher quality video uploads or profile customizations like colors and avatar frames. Bluesky will always be free to use — we believe that information and conversation should be easily accessible, not locked down. We won’t uprank accounts simply because they’re subscribing to a paid tier.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’re proud of our vibrant community of creators, including artists, writers, developers, and more, and we want to establish a voluntary monetization path for them as well. Part of our plan includes building payment services for people to support their favorite creators and projects. We’ll share more information as this develops.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s open technology, the AT Protocol, makes a whole ecosystem of apps possible. We’re excited that developers have already begun building their own applications with totally different purposes from the Bluesky app. For example, <a href="https://smokesignal.events/">Smoke Signal</a> is an events app, <a href="https://frontpage.fyi/">Frontpage</a> is a web forum, and <a href="https://bluecast.app/">Bluecast</a> is an audio app (that includes karaoke with licensed songs)! We hypothesize that monetization strategies like subscriptions, domain-name registrations, and payments to creators will enable these independent apps to grow as well.</p>
<p>With every month that passes, the need for an open social network becomes more clear. We’re very excited about where we’re headed — we’re building not just another social app, but an entire network that gives users freedom and choice. Thank you for joining us.</p>
 What have we done since our last fundraise? 
<p>Since raising our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">seed round</a> last year, we have:</p>
 
 Grown Bluesky from an invite-only app with 1M users to an open app serving more than 13M people! We’ve welcomed millions of people from the United States, Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and more. 
 Launched <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">federation</a> for self-hosters and developers. Now there are over 1,000 other personal data servers (PDS) outside of Bluesky. 
 Launched <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">custom feeds</a>, making algorithmic choice a reality. Now there are over 50k+ feeds on Bluesky. 
 Invested heavily in <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-18-2024-trust-safety-update">anti-harassment tooling and Trust and Safety</a>. 
 Built <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">labeling services</a> and opened the ability for anyone to run foundational pieces of stackable moderation. Additionally, open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">Ozone</a>, a moderation tool. 
 Shipped highly-requested features like <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/05-22-2024-direct-messages">direct messaging</a>, GIFs, and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video">video</a>.

  <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thrilled to announce three major Microsoft Entra ID advancements that will help you protect your users with phishing-resistant authentication:</p>
 
 Public preview refresh: Device-bound passkey support in Microsoft Authenticator 
 Public preview: Support for FIDO2 security keys on native brokered applications, such as Outlook and Teams, on Android 14 
 General availability: FIPS compliance for Microsoft Authenticator on Android 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These advancements are crucial, not only for adhering to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">US Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity</a>, but also for safeguarding all organizations and users who rely on secure digital identities. Let’s dig deeper!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Public preview refresh: Device-bound passkey support in Microsoft Authenticator 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-expanding-passkey-support-in-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/4062702">World Password Day</a> in May, we announced the public preview of device-bound passkey support in Microsoft Authenticator for iOS and Android, tailored for organizations with higher security assurance requirements. We’re now refreshing this feature with some exciting new capabilities!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During public preview, we received valuable feedback from customers that the registration experience for passkeys can be cumbersome and error-prone. Some users, when registering from their laptops, encountered as many as 19 steps, missed essential prerequisites like enabling Bluetooth on their device, or inadvertently set up their passkey with an unsupported provider. Based on this feedback, we’ve improved the registration flow to provide a more tailored experience to ensure users are successful when registering their passkey. We've also optimized the registration process by initially directing users to sign into the Authenticator app. This approach provides a seamless experience, guiding users through prerequisites, while significantly reducing contextual switches between devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to enhancing the user experience, we’ve also strengthened the security posture by introducing attestation support. When configured, we leverage Android and iOS APIs to verify the legitimacy of the Microsoft Authenticator app on the user's device prior to registering the passkey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two capabilities are now in preview, and we highly encourage you to start piloting these features in your organization and share your feedback with us as we prepare for general availability coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get started, please refer to our <a href="https://aka.ms/PasskeyInAuthenticator">documentation</a>. To learn more about passkey support in Microsoft Entra ID, please read our original announcement, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-expanding-passkey-support-in-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/4062702">Public preview: Expanding passkey support in Microsoft Entra ID</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Public preview: Passkey (FIDO2) authentication in brokered Microsoft applications on Android 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conjunction to the public preview refresh of passkey support in Microsoft Authenticator, we’re also introducing public preview support for passkey (FIDO2) authentication within brokered Microsoft applications on Android. Users can now use a FIDO2 security key or passkey in the Microsoft Authenticator app to sign into Microsoft apps, such as Teams and Outlook, when either the Microsoft Authenticator app or Microsoft Intune Company Portal app is installed as the authentication broker on an Android 14+ device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support for FIDO2 security key sign-in to brokered Microsoft apps on Android 13 will be coming in the following months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 General availability: FIPS compliance for Microsoft Authenticator on Android 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Authenticator on both iOS and Android is now FIPS 140 compliant. While <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-brings-fips-140-compliance-to-authenticator-supporting/ba-p/2365671">iOS Authenticator app has been FIPS 140 compliant since December 2022</a>, we released the FIPS 140 compliant version of the Android Authenticator app in September 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIPS 140 compliance for Microsoft Authenticator helps federal agencies meet the requirements of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order (EO) 14028, “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity”</a> and healthcare organizations with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-epcs-us">Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS)</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All authentications in Microsoft Entra ID with Authenticator including passkeys, passwordless phone sign-in, multifactor authentication (MFA), and one-time password codes are considered FIPS compliant.&nbsp; No changes in configuration are required in Microsoft Authenticator or Microsoft Entra ID admin center to enable this capability. Users on Microsoft Authenticator version 6.2408.5807 and higher on Android will be FIPS 140 compliant by default for Microsoft Entra ID authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Authenticator on Android uses WolfSSL Inc.’s wolfCrypt module to achieve FIPS 140-3 Level 1 compliance. For additional details on the certification being used, refer to <a href="http://Cryptographic%20Module%20Validation%20Program">Cryptographic Module Validation Program</a> information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these releases, we’ve significantly upleveled the user experience and security posture of Microsoft Authenticator, making it easier for you to achieve your phishing-resistance goals. If you haven't considered phishing-resistance yet, we highly recommend doing so. You can use our updated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-plan-prerequisites-phishing-resistant-passwordless-authentication">passwordless deployment guide</a> to get started on this journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to you trying out these improvements and sharing your feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Thales has proudly reaffirmed its support to the Armed Forces Community by re-signing the Armed Forces Covenant. As a long-standing supporter and Gold Award holder of the Ministry of Defence's Employer Recognition Scheme, this renewed commitment reflects our continued dedication to both the individuals and families connected to the UK's military services.</p>
 A Legacy of Support and Partnership 
<p>For over a decade, Thales in the UK has embedded its Armed Forces Covenant within its core values, ensuring that military personnel, veterans, reservists, and their families are provided with meaningful career opportunities, support networks, and pathways to success in the civilian workforce. With at least 10% of our UK workforce comprising members of the Armed Forces Community, we deeply value their training, experience, and the unique perspectives they bring.</p>
<p>Our CEO, Phil Siveter, stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>Thales in the UK remains deeply committed to supporting the Armed Forces Community. The re-signing of our Covenant not only renews our foundational promises but strengthens them with new initiatives that reflect the evolving needs of veterans, reservists, and service families within our business.</p>
</blockquote>
 Refreshed Promises for the Future 
<p>The revitalised Covenant introduces new commitments to broaden our support. We have expanded our definition of the Armed Forces Community to include service families, recognising their crucial role in the overall support ecosystem. Our policies now offer greater flexibility in leave for family members during deployment, as well as enhanced volunteering opportunities.</p>
<p>All UK employees are entitled to 24 hours of volunteering leave annually, with an additional two weeks granted to reservists and, under our new commitment, to Adult Cadet Force Volunteers as well. This initiative further extends our dedication to supporting current and future Armed Forces generations.</p>
 Building Careers and Second Chances 
<p>Thales remains at the forefront of offering meaningful employment opportunities to those transitioning out of military service. Through partnerships with the Career Transition Partnership and Forces Families Jobs, we provide tailored entry routes into the company. Already exceeding our recruitment targets, we are proud to have hosted multiple military insight days and recruited over 70 service leavers this year alone. Our ongoing aim is to expand this further and bring more than 100 new Armed Forces Community members into Thales each year.</p>
 A Commitment to Communities 
<p>In addition to career support, Thales&nbsp; also focuses on social value by engaging with military charities and contributing to local communities. Our latest efforts include supporting the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Royal British Legion through our "Volunteering as an Act of Remembrance" initiative, enabling employees to make a lasting impact in preserving our shared heritage.</p>
<p>As Thales continues to grow and innovate, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the Armed Forces Community. This re-signing marks not only a reaffirmation of our promises but also a deepening of our resolve to ensure that those who have served are supported in every possible way.</p>
<p>
For more information, please refer to our full Armed Forces Covenant below.</p>

Order intake in emerging markets amounted to €4,137 million, with strong organic growth of 69% as at September 30, 2024. This performance reflected excellent momentum in the Near and Middle East (up 175% on an organic basis) and in Asia (up 49% on an organic basis).</p>
<p>Order intake in the Aerospace segment totaled €3,639 million, versus €3,403 million over the first nine months of 2023 (+8% at constant scope and exchange rates). This increase reflects two contrasting trends. On the one hand, the avionics market remained strong, our activities growing double-digit organically. On the other hand, the order intake in the space business declined due to a high comparison basis (two large orders signed as at September 30, 2024 versus five as of September 30, 2023).</p>
<p>At €8,951 million (compared with €6,404 million for the first nine months of 2023), order intake in the Defence &amp; Security segment continued to record a strong momentum, with organic growth of 40%. Seven new orders with a unit value of more than €100 million in the third quarter were added to the nine already recorded in the first half of the year. The order book stood at €37.0 billion, compared with €35.1 billion at September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>At €2,905&nbsp;million, order intake in the Digital Identity &amp; Security segment was in line with sales over the period, as most of the activities in this segment operate on short cycles.</p>
 Sales 
<p>Sales for the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €14,069million, compared with €12,854 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 6.2% at constant scope and exchange rates.</p>
<p>From a geographical5 point of view, sales growth was strong in mature markets (+6.3% on an organic basis), driven in particular by Europe (+9.0%) including France (+9.4%), and Australia and New Zealand (+8.5%). Emerging markets posted organic growth of +5.8% over the period.</p>
<p>Sales in the Aerospace segment amounted to €3,839 million, up 5.6% compared to the first nine months of 2023 (+5.3% at constant scope and exchange rates). This growth reflected ongoing robust demand in the avionics market, leading the activity to grow mid-single digit plus. It was however mitigated by the low-single digit organic growth of the space business.</p>
<p>Sales in the Defence &amp; Security segment totaled €7,239&nbsp;million, up +8.8% compared to the first nine months of 2023 (+8.5% at constant scope and exchange rates). After sustained growth recorded in the first half of the year, this segment confirmed its strong momentum in the third quarter. Growth was driven in particular by land and air systems. </p>
<p>In the Digital Identity &amp; Security segment, sales totaled €2,914 million, up 15.7% in the first nine months of 2024 (+0.3% at constant scope and exchange rates), including the positive scope effect linked to the acquisitions of Tesserent and Imperva. The stability in organic growth in this segment reflects contrasting trends: </p>
 
 Banking and Payment solutions, negatively affected by a high comparison basis, continued to suffer from further destocking in North America; 
 Steady pace of growth in Cyber and Biometrics activities; 
 Continued ramp-up on Connectivity Solutions market, recording double-digit organic growth. 
 
 Outlook 
<p>Thales continues to benefit from its solid positioning in all its major markets and enjoys robust medium-term outlook, as illustrated by the continued strong sales momentum in the third quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>As a result, assuming there are no major new disruptions in the global economy or global supply chains, Thales confirms its 2024 annual targets:</p>
 
 A book-to-bill ratio above 1; 
 Organic sales growth of between +5% and +6%, corresponding to sales in the range of €19.9 billion to €20.1 billion6;  
 An EBIT margin between 11.7% and 11.8%. 
 
<p>****</p>
<p>This press release contains certain forward-looking statements. Although Thales believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, as described in the Company's Universal Registration Document, which has been filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF).</p>
<p>1 In this press release, “organic” means “at constant scope and exchange rates”.</p>
<p>2 Between €19.9 billion and €20.1 billion based on September 2024 scope and exchange rates.</p>
<p>3 Mature markets: Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand; emerging markets: all other countries. </p>
<p>4 Taking into account a negative currency effect of -€45 million and a positive net scope effect of €441 million.</p>

  <p>Integrating with Okta management API endpoints might be a good idea if you are trying to read or manage Okta resources programmatically. This blog demonstrates how to securely set up a node application to interact with Okta management API endpoints using a service app.</p>

<p>Okta API management endpoints can be accessed using an access token issued by the Okta org authorization server with the appropriate scopes needed to make an API call. This can be either through authorization code flow for the user as principal or client credentials flow for a service as principal.</p>

<p>For this blog, we will examine the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow. Okta requires the <code>private_key_jwt</code> token endpoint authentication type for this flow. Access tokens generated by the Okta org authorization server expire in one hour. Any client can call Okta API endpoints with the token during this hour.</p>

 How do you make OAuth 2.0 access tokens more secure? 

<p>Increase security by constraining the token to the sender. By constraining the token sender, the resource server knows every request originates from the original client that initially requested the token. OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) is a way to achieve this, as explained in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449">this rfc</a>. You can read more about DPoP in this post:</p>

 
              <a>

<p>To demonstrate this, we will first set up a node application with a service app without requiring DPoP. Then, we’ll add the DPoP constraint and make the necessary changes in our app to implement it.</p>

 Create a service app with OAuth 2.0 client credentials without DPoP 

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>You’ll need the following tools:</p>
 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> v18 or greater 
   IDE (I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>) 
   Terminal window (I used the integrated terminal in VS Code) 
 

 Add OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) to your Node.js service application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer edition account. Sign up for a free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Workforce Identity Cloud Developer Edition account</a> if you don’t already have one.</p>

<p>Open <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">your Okta dashboard</a> in a browser. Navigate to Applications &gt; Applications. Select API Services and press Next. Name your application and press Save.</p>

 
   In the General tab, note the Client ID value and your Okta domain. You can find the Okta domain by expanding the settings menu in the toolbar. You need these values for your application configuration. 
   Press edit in the Client Credentials section and follow these steps: 
   Change the Client authentication to <code>Public Key / Private Key</code> 
   In the PUBLIC KEYS section, press the Add key button. Click Generate new key to have Okta generate a new key. Save the private key (in PEM format)  in a file called <code>cc_private_key.pem</code> for later use. 
   Press Save 
 

<p>In General Settings section, press edit and make the following changes:</p>
 
   Disable Proof of possession &gt; Require Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) header in token requests 
   Press Save 
 

<p>Navigate to the Okta API Scopes tab and grant the <code>okta.users.read</code> scope.</p>

<p>In the Admin roles tab, press Edit assignments. Find the <code>Read-only Administrator</code> in the Role selection menu, and press the Save Changes button.</p>

<p>Those are all of the changes required in Okta until you re-enable DPoP.</p>

 Configure OAuth 2.0 in the Node.js service 

<p>Create a project directory for local development named <code>okta-node-dpop</code>. Open the project directory in your IDE. Create a file called <code>.env</code> file to the project root directory and add the following configuration settings:</p>

   <code>OKTA_ORG_URL=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
OKTA_SCOPES=okta.users.read
OKTA_CC_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=./assets/cc_private_key.pem
</code>   

<p>Save the private key file from the earlier step as <code>assets/cc_private_key.pem</code> in the root directory.</p>

 Create an OAuth 2.0-compliant Node.js service app 

<p>Open a terminal window in the project directory and run <code>npm init</code> to create the scaffolding. Press Enter to accept all defaults.</p>

<p>Install dependencies for the project by running:</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@16.4.5 jsonwebtoken@9.0.2
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>oktaService.js</code> file in the project root. We’ll add the basic foundation of authenticating and calling Okta endpoints in this file. This file contains three key functions:</p>

 
   <code>oktaService.authenticate(..)</code> method gets an access token by:
     
       Generating a private key JWT required for authenticating and signs it using a keypair registered in the Okta application 
       Generating the token request to Okta org authorization server 
       Retrieving and stores the access token for future calls
Note - This token is valid for one hour by default at the time of writing this article 
     
   
   <code>oktaService.managementApiCall(..)</code> method makes the Okta management API calls and adds the necessary headers and tokens to enable the request 
   <code>oktaHelper</code> contains utility methods to store okta configuration, access token, generating private key JWT, generating token request 
 

<p>Add the following code to the <code>oktaService.js</code> file:</p>

   <code>const fs = require("fs");
const crypto = require("crypto");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
require("dotenv").config(); // Loads variables in .env file into the environment

const oktaHelper = {
  oktaDomain: process.env.OKTA_ORG_URL || "", // Okta domain URL
  oktaClientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID || "", // Client ID of API service app
  oktaScopes: process.env.OKTA_SCOPES || "", // Scopes requested - Okta management API scopes
  ccPrivateKeyFile: process.env.OKTA_CC_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE || "", // Private Key for signing Private key JWT
  ccPrivateKey: null,
  accessToken: "",
  getTokenEndpoint: function () {
    return `${this.oktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/token`;
  }, // Token endpoint
  getNewJti: function () {
    return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
  }, // Helper method to generate new identifier
  generateCcToken: function () {
    // Helper method to generate private key jwt
    let privateKey =
      this.ccPrivateKey || fs.readFileSync(this.ccPrivateKeyFile);
    let signingOptions = {
      algorithm: "RS256",
      expiresIn: "5m",
      audience: this.getTokenEndpoint(),
      issuer: this.oktaClientId,
      subject: this.oktaClientId,
    };
    return jwt.sign({ jti: this.getNewJti() }, privateKey, signingOptions);
  },
  tokenRequest: function (ccToken) {
    // generate token request using client_credentials grant type
    return fetch(this.getTokenEndpoint(), {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Accept: "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: "client_credentials",
        scope: this.oktaScopes,
        client_assertion_type:
          "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
        client_assertion: ccToken,
      }),
    });
  },
};

const oktaService = {
  authenticate: async function () {
    // Use to authenticate and generate access token
    if (!oktaHelper.accessToken) {
      console.log("Valid access token not found. Retrieving new token...\n");
      let ccToken = oktaHelper.generateCcToken();
      console.log(`Using Private Key JWT: ${ccToken}\n`);
      console.log(`Making token call to ${oktaHelper.getTokenEndpoint()}`);
      let tokenResp = await oktaHelper.tokenRequest(ccToken);
      let respBody = await tokenResp.json();
      oktaHelper.accessToken = respBody["access_token"];
      console.log(
        `Successfully retrieved access token: ${oktaHelper.accessToken}\n`
      );
    }
    return oktaHelper.accessToken;
  },
  managementApiCall: function (relativeUri, httpMethod, headers, body) {
    // Construct Okta management API calls
    let uri = `${oktaHelper.oktaDomain}${relativeUri}`;
    let reqHeaders = {
      Accept: "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${oktaHelper.accessToken}`,
      ...headers,
    };
    return fetch(uri, {
      method: httpMethod,
      headers: reqHeaders,
      body,
    });
  },
};

module.exports = oktaService;
</code>   

<p>Add a new file named <code>app.js</code> in the project root folder. This is the entry point for running our Node.js service application. In this file, we’ll do the following:</p>

 
   Import <code>oktaService</code> 
   Create an async wrapper to execute asynchronous code 
   Authenticate to Okta by calling <code>oktaService.authenticate()</code> 
   Validate the previous step by listing users using a <code>GET</code> call to Okta’s <code>/api/v1/users</code> endpoint 
 

<p>Paste the following code into the <code>app.js</code> file:</p>
   <code>const oktaService = require('./oktaService.js');

(async () =&gt; {
  await oktaService.authenticate();

  let usersResp = await oktaService.managementApiCall('/api/v1/users', 'GET');
  if(usersResp.status == 200) {
    let respBody = await usersResp.json();
    console.log(`Users List: ${JSON.stringify(respBody)}\n`);
  } else {
    console.log('API error', usersResp);
  }
})();
</code>   

<p>Next, update this as the entry point. In the <code>package.json</code> file, update the <code>scripts</code> property with the following:</p>

   <code>"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
</code>   

<p>This gives us an easy way to run the app. Run the app using <code>npm start</code>. You should see a list of console logs:</p>

   <code>Valid access token not found. Retrieving new token...
Using Private Key JWT: eyJh........
Making token call to https://........../oauth2/v1/token
Successfully retrieved access token: eyJ..................
Users List: [.........]
</code>   

<p>If you receive any errors, this is a good time to troubleshoot and resolve issues before adding DPoP.</p>

 Secure access tokens by adding DPoP to the Node.js service 

<p>Why isn’t OAuth 2.0 client credential flow enough?</p>

<p>Our setup used the <code>client_credentials</code> grant type to authenticate and get an access token. If someone gets hold of the private_key_jwt, they cannot replay it beyond expiration (I reduced it to 5 minutes to shorten this window). However, if someone gets ahold of the access token, they can use it for up to 1 hour, which is the default expiration time of an access token.</p>

<p>Constraining the token sender is one way to make the access token more secure. How can you do that? By adding the Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) OAuth extension method to the access token interaction. The technique adds a sender-generated token for each call it makes. Doing so prevents replay attacks even before tokens expire since each call needs a fresh DPoP token. Here is the detailed flow:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll enable DPoP in Okta application settings to experiment with sender-constrained tokens. Open the Okta Admin Console in your browser and navigate to Application &gt; Application to see the list of Okta applications in your Okta account. Open the service application to edit it.</p>

<p>In your service app’s General Settings section, change Proof of possession &gt; Require Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) header in token requests to <code>true</code>. Then click Save.</p>

<p>You need a new public/private key pair to sign the DPoP proof JWT. If you know how to generate one, feel free to skip this step. I used the following steps to generate it:</p>
 
   Go to <a href="https://mkjwk.org/">JWK generator</a> 
   Select the following and then click Generate.
     
       Key Use: Signature 
       Algorithm: RS256 
       Key ID: SHA-256 
       Show X.509: Yes 
     
   
   Copy the Public Key (JSON format) and save it to <code>assets/dpop_public_key.json</code> 
   Copy the Private Key (X.509 PEM format) (Do not click Copy to Clipboard. This will copy as a single line, which will not work with the following steps. Instead, copy the value manually and save it) and save it to <code>assets/dpop_private_key.pem</code> 
 

<p>Now that you have a new keypair for DPoP, you’ll add the variables to the project. In the <code>.env</code> file, add the new file paths:</p>

   <code>....
OKTA_SCOPES=okta.users.read
OKTA_CC_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=./assets/cc_private_key.pem
OKTA_DPOP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=./assets/dpop_private_key.pem
OKTA_DPOP_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=./assets/dpop_public_key.json
</code>   

<p>Add the DPoP-related code to <code>oktaService.js</code>. Add the key files to config. We can use this while adding DPoP to our methods:</p>

   <code>const oktaHelper = {
  .......
  ccPrivateKeyFile: process.env.OKTA_CC_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE || '', // Private Key for signing Private key JWT
  ccPrivateKey: null,
  // Add this code ======================
  dpopPrivateKeyFile: process.env.OKTA_DPOP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE || '', // Private key for signing DPoP proof JWT
  dpopPublicKeyFile: process.env.OKTA_DPOP_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE || '', // Public key for signing DPoP proof JWT
  dpopPrivateKey: null,
  dpopPublicKey: null,
  // Add above code ======================
  accessToken: '',
  .....
}
</code>   

<p>Add a helper method to generate a DPoP value. This helper method adds an access token to the DPoP proof JWT header. It’ll construct the JWT based on the format defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#section-4.2">spec</a>.</p>

   <code>const oktaHelper = {
  .....
  // Add this as the last attribute of oktaHelper object
  generateDpopToken: function(htm, htu, additionalClaims) {
    let privateKey = this.dpopPrivateKey || fs.readFileSync(this.dpopPrivateKeyFile);
    let publicKey = this.dpopPublicKey || fs.readFileSync(this.dpopPublicKeyFile)
    let signingOptions = {
      algorithm: 'RS256',
      expiresIn: '5m',
      header: {
        typ: 'dpop+jwt',
        alg: 'RS256',
        jwk: JSON.parse(publicKey)
      }
    };
    let payload = {
      ...additionalClaims,
      htu,
      htm,
      jti: this.getNewJti()
    };
    return jwt.sign(payload, privateKey, signingOptions);
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Next, add the DPoP proof token to the <code>tokenRequest</code> method. This method gets the newly generated DPoP proof token and adds it to the token request as a header.</p>

   <code>// Add dpopToken as a new parameter
tokenRequest: function(ccToken, dpopToken) { // generate token request using client_credentials grant type
  return fetch(this.getTokenEndpoint(), {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      // New Code - Start
      DPoP: dpopToken
      // New Code - End
    },
    ...
  });
},
</code>   

<p>Add the following steps to the <code>authenticate</code> method to add DPoP.</p>
 
   Generate a new DPoP proof for <code>POST</code> method and token endpoint 
   Make token call with both <code>private_key_jwt</code> and <code>DPoP</code> jwt 
   Okta adds an extra security measure by adding a <code>nonce</code> to token requests requiring DPoP. This will respond to token requests that don’t include a nonce with the <code>use_dpop_nonce</code> error. Read more about the nonce <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#name-authorization-server-provid">in the spec</a>. 
   After this step, we’ll generate a new DPoP proof JWT including nonce value in payload 
   Make the token call again with this new JWT 
 

<p>Once we follow these steps, we’ll have a new access token to use in our API call. Let’s implement the steps. Update the <code>authenticate</code> method to the following:</p>

   <code>authenticate: async function() { // Use to authenticate and generate access token
  if(!oktaHelper.accessToken) { 
    console.log('Valid access token not found. Retrieving new token...\n');
    let ccToken = oktaHelper.generateCcToken();
    console.log(`Using Private Key JWT: ${ccToken}\n`);

    // New Code - Start
    let dpopToken = oktaHelper.generateDpopToken('POST', oktaHelper.getTokenEndpoint());
    console.log(`Using DPoP proof: ${dpopToken}\n`);
    // New Code - End

    console.log(`Making token call to ${oktaHelper.getTokenEndpoint()}`);

    // Update following line by adding dpopToken parameter
    let tokenResp = await oktaHelper.tokenRequest(ccToken, dpopToken);
    let respBody = await tokenResp.json();

    // New Code - Start
    if(tokenResp.status != 400 || (respBody &amp;&amp; respBody.error != 'use_dpop_nonce')) {
      console.log('Authentication Failed');
      console.log(respBody);
      return null;
    }
    let dpopNonce = tokenResp.headers.get('dpop-nonce');
    console.log(`Token call failed with nonce error \n`);
    dpopToken = oktaHelper.generateDpopToken('POST', oktaHelper.getTokenEndpoint(), {nonce: dpopNonce});
    ccToken = oktaHelper.generateCcToken();
    console.log(`Retrying token call to ${oktaHelper.getTokenEndpoint()} with DPoP nonce ${dpopNonce}`);
    tokenResp = await oktaHelper.tokenRequest(ccToken, dpopToken);
    respBody = await tokenResp.json();
    // New Code - End

    oktaHelper.accessToken = respBody['access_token'];
    console.log(`Successfully retrieved access token: ${oktaHelper.accessToken}\n`);
  }
  return oktaHelper.accessToken;
}
</code>   

<p>Before proceeding, make sure to enable DPoP in your Okta service application. Now, test the steps by running <code>npm start</code> in the terminal. OOPS! You would have received an access token, but a call to the user’s API failed with a 400 status. We didn’t include the DPoP proof in this API call. With DPoP enabled, we must include a new DPoP proof for every call. This prevents malicious actors from reusing stolen access tokens.</p>

<p>Let’s add some code to include DPoP proof during every API call.</p>

<p>In the <code>oktaService.js</code> file, add a helper method to generate the hash of the access token or <code>ath</code> value. You’ll use this value later to bind access tokens with DPoP proofs:</p>

   <code>const oktaHelper = {
  .....,
  // Add as the last attribute of oktaHelper object
  generateAth: function(token) {
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(token).digest('base64').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\=/g, '');
  }
};
</code>   

<p>A valid DPoP proof JWT includes the access token hash (<code>ath</code>) value. To make this change, update <code>managementApiCall</code> method</p>

   <code>managementApiCall: function (relativeUri, httpMethod, headers, body) { // Construct Okta management API calls 
  let uri = `${oktaHelper.oktaDomain}${relativeUri}`;

  // New Code - Start
  let ath = oktaHelper.generateAth(oktaHelper.accessToken);
  let dpopToken = oktaHelper.generateDpopToken(httpMethod, uri, {ath});
  // New Code - End

  // Update reqHeaders object
  let reqHeaders = {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `DPoP ${oktaHelper.accessToken}`,
    'DPoP': dpopToken,
    ...headers
  };
  return fetch(uri, {
    method: httpMethod,
    headers: reqHeaders,
    body
  });
}
</code>   

<p>Run <code>npm start</code>. Voila! You see a list of users!</p>

<p>We successfully authenticated to Okta with a service app demonstrating DPoP and are using this access token and DPoP proof to access Okta Admin Management API endpoints.</p>

 Experiment with DPoP and API scopes for Okta API and custom resource server calls 

<p>You can download the completed project from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-dpop-example">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Try modifying the project using different Okta API scopes and experimenting with other endpoints. Ensure you give permissions to your service app by assigning appropriate Admin roles. To improve security, you can implement similar protection to your custom resource server endpoints using a custom authorization server and custom set of scopes.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ftcs-rule-banning-fake-online-reviews-effect-115009298">Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) has introduced a new rule banning fake online reviews</a>. This rule, which penalizes businesses and individuals involved in the sale or purchase of fake reviews, represents a much needed step in promoting trust online. But while enforcement is crucial, there's still a challenge of identifying which reviews are legitimate. This is where <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> can provide a solution.</p>

 
  
  
  The Problem with Fake Reviews
 

<p>Fake reviews have been an issue for years, distorting consumer choices. As FTC Chair Lina Khan pointed out, these reviews “pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors.” </p>

<p>Let's face it, with pretty much every social networking site turning into an online shopping mall, many purchasing decisions are influenced by online reviews. I, personally, do most of my shopping online and I rely very heavily on reviews. I often question which ones are actually real, and if I'm not sure, I often shy away from making the purchase at all - which isn't good for me or the business.</p>

<p>The new FTC rule aims to crack down on this problem by prohibiting reviews from people who don’t exist, those who have no real experience with the product, or those misrepresenting their experience. It also bans businesses from creating or selling fake reviews. While these measures are great, enforcing them effectively presents challenges, especially with AI-generated content.</p>

 
  
  
  How Can Verifiable Credentials Help
 

<p>Verifiable Credentials are digital certificates that prove specific facts about an individual or entity. These credentials are cryptographically signed, making them tamper-proof, and they can be independently verified without relying on a central authority. In the context of online reviews, VCs can establish authenticity.</p>

<p>Here’s how it could work:</p>

<p>When a customer purchases a product or uses a service, the business can issue a VC to confirm their legitimate experience. This can even be attached to their receipt. This credential could serve as proof that the individual has transacted with the business, preventing fake reviews from people with no real experience.</p>

<p>A review platform could require users to attach a VC that verifies they have purchased or used the product before submitting a review. This would eliminate fake reviews from non-customers and ensure that only those with firsthand experience can provide feedback.</p>

<p>Since VCs are cryptographically signed, they cannot be altered or faked. This ensures the integrity of the review content and prevents businesses from modifying or fabricating reviews to boost their reputations.</p>

 
  
  
  Benefits for Businesses and Consumers
 

 
 <p>Consumers would no longer have to second guess the authenticity of reviews. They can trust that every review is tied to a verified, real customer.</p> 
 <p>By adopting VCs, businesses can ensure they remain compliant with the new FTC rule. They would have a verifiable record that shows they only accept reviews from legitimate customers, protecting themselves from potential penalties.</p> 
 <p>Early adopters of VCs in their review systems could set themselves apart from competitors. Businesses that champion transparency and fairness by using VCs can build stronger relationships with their customers, enhancing brand loyalty.</p> 
 <p>Using VCs can automate the verification process, reducing the need for manual review moderation. As AI continues to be used in generating content, including reviews, this automation is key to keeping platforms efficient while maintaining high standards of trust.</p> 
 

 
  
  
  Trust But Verify
 

<p>The FTC’s new rule is a step in the right direction, but to truly tackle the problem of fake reviews, the marketplace needs more than just enforcement. It needs technology that ensures transparency and trust. Verifiable Credentials can provide that assurance, giving businesses and consumers the tools they need to foster a fair, competitive, and honest marketplace. As online commerce continues to grow, adopting VCs could be the key to making reviews a trustworthy resource once again.</p>

				  Indicio Proven Auth allows you to quickly configure single sign-on (SSO) so that your customers or end users can login with portable digital identities instead of usernames and passwords.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>With <a href="https://indicio.tech/gartner-names-indicio-as-a-representative-vendor-in-decentralized-identity-market-guide/">Gartner Research predicting</a> a massive shift towards decentralized digital identity and verifiable claims, Indicio has launched a simple, powerful solution for any business or organization to benefit from using Verifiable Credentials — Indicio Proven® Auth.</p>
<p>Proven Auth allows you to quickly configure Single Sign-on (SSO) so that your customers or end users can use a Verifiable Credential to login to applications and websites instead of usernames and passwords. This means:</p>
 
 Replacing weak passwords and weak second-factor authentication for better security. 
 No tracking by centralized third-party identity providers. 
 No worries if a federated identity provider goes dark. 
 Reduce steps for authentication in a zero-trust architecture model. 
 Simpler, more secure user experience. 
 Take advantage of the portable digital identity transformation in the European Union (eIDAS, EUDI), the travel sector, and in mobile driver’s licenses. 
 
<p>Unlock the feature-rich technology driving digital transformation</p>
<p>The improved workflow, privacy, and security are enough to justify making the switch — but there’s a lot more feature-rich power to using&nbsp; Verifiable Credentials for SSO and identity access management.</p>
 
 Get all these features faster and cheaper than conventional identity access management solutions. 
 Comes with Keycloak for identity access management, but is easily configurable to use other software. 
 Combine popular protocols&nbsp; (e.g. OIDC, SAML) with widely-used policy engines (such as Amazon Verifiable Permissions or Abacus) for role- or user-based authorization decisions based on the attributes of a Verifiable Credential. 
 Unlike conventional identity provision, Proven Auth enables systems to allow access based on credentials they have never seen before provided they trust the source (e.g., government-issued ID).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Credentials can be quickly configured to handle complex information flows, making it easier to implement least-privilege access for zero trust. 
 Verifiable Credentials go beyond the limits of passkeys, do not need to be enrolled,&nbsp; and they are able to hold contextually useful information that can be shared by consent (simplifying compliance). 
 
<p>How Indicio Proven Auth delivers next-gen SSO, privacy, security, and user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conventional SSO requires you to use a third-party identity provider to authenticate access to multiple applications and services. While this saves you from entering a password and username for each session with each service, it still means relying on a subscription to a third-party identity provider and cumbersome password rotation, which add additional expense and unnecessary complexity to the user experience.</p>
<p>For example: if an employer issues a Verifiable Credential to an employee, the employer can be certain it’s their employee accessing an application or system rather than simply trust an outside identity provider. The employee doesn’t need to use or rotate passwords, their access into the company’s systems cannot be stolen or phished, and third-party identity providers aren’t able to track employee login behavior.</p>
<p>Seamless SaaS access</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials use advanced cryptography for instant, seamless authentication. You can be certain of the source of the credential, you can be certain that it is bound to the person or organization it has been issued to, and you can be certain that the data inside has not been altered.</p>
<p>SaaS applications can be quickly configured to accept a Verifiable Credential instead of a third-party identity provider. All you need to do is issue a Verifiable Credential or decide which Verifiable Credential issuers are valid for accessing your system. When logging into an application, Proven Auth checks to see if the credential issuer is valid and provides the destination system with the necessary data about who you are and what you should have access to. Proven Auth doesn’t need to have seen your credential before to do this.</p>
<p>Combine SSO with secure biometric authentication<br>For critical security access, Verifiable Credentials are a powerful way to implement biometric access, as a liveness check can be accompanied by the presentation of a biometric template bound to a credential and both compared for instantaneous authentication.</p>
<p>Do more for less</p>
<p>Compared with current approaches to managing identity, privacy, and security, Gartner’s Market Report notes that decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; represent “magnitudes of improvement in terms of efficiency, cost and assurance.”</p>
<p>To see how Indicio Proven Auth can transform your identity access management and prepare you to take advantage of a decentralized world, why not book a demo and learn how&nbsp; Indicio is deploying Verifiable Credential solutions across different sectors for seamless trust.</p>

             October 2024   
	 
		 
			 Institutional Tokenization 3.0: Break Silos 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Since Tokeny started building tokenization solutions in 2017, we have seen financial institutions exploring tokenization of assets in many different ways. The evolution has unfolded in three main phases, each addressing the limitations of the previous one.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Tokenization 1.0 – Permissioned networks 
<p>Initially, institutions turned to permissioned blockchains for tokenizing assets, prioritizing full control over the network to control tokens. However, this approach quickly exposed limitations in terms of scalability and interoperability, making it difficult for tokens to interact with external applications.</p>
 Tokenization 2.0 –&nbsp;ERC-20 Permissionless Tokens + Wallet Whitelists 
<p>To solve these issues, institutions started to turn to ERC-20 tokens with wallet whitelists on public blockchains. While this allowed some control over the distribution of tokens, it introduced new compliance and scalability problems: wallets are not linked to identities on the blockchain, so onchain ownership records became unreliable.</p>
<p>It made cross-platform distribution and onchain settlement complex from a compliance perspective because compliance and transfer rules were enforced off-chain, keeping tokens confined within a single platform.</p>
 Tokenization 3.0 – ERC-3643, Identity-Based Permissioned Tokens 
<p>The open sourcing of ERC-3643 in 2022 introduced identity-based permissioned tokens, ensuring that ownership and compliance remain reliable in every situation.</p>
 
 Interoperability, Not Competition: A common misconception is that using ERC-3643 means competing with other token standards. However, ERC-3643 is built for interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem. By being fully compatible with ERC-20 tokens, assets tokenized using ERC-3643 can integrate seamlessly with existing wallets, DeFi platforms, and analytics tools. 
 Modular and Composable: ERC-3643 allows projects to start with a flexible compliance framework and expand its functionality through composability. This modular approach enables projects to combine additional smart contracts (e.g., automated capital calls, dividend allocation, …) to meet specific needs. 
 Eliminating Single Points of Failure: ERC-3643 links token ownership to identity addresses instead of wallets. Authorized parties validate an investor’s eligibility and issue proofs onchain to their identity addresses, ensuring that compliance and ownership records are always tied to a verified identity. Wallets and platforms won’t be the single points of failure as the ownership remains secure and verifiable through the onchain identity. 
 Issuer Control, Not Platform Lock-In: As transfer rules are enforced onchain, issuers and their appointed agents maintain control of their tokens. They always have real-time insights on who owns what without relying on distributors’ sub-ledgers. With this approach, issuers are no longer restricted to tokenization platform silos. They represent their assets onchain, appoint agents, and activate distribution channels. 
 
<p>ERC-3643 paves the way for breaking tokenization silos, enabling cross-smart contracts and cross-platform interoperability. Alongside 78 industry leaders, we proudly support the non-profit ERC3643 Association in improving this open market standard. Together, we can drive lasting impact through collaboration.</p>
<p>So, what do you think Tokenization 4.0 will look like?</p>

<p>Digital identity wallets are too important to be treated as just an app, with only your favorite app store’s guidelines. I also think it’s too important to solely rely on a mess of government guidelines written with varying degrees of clarity.</p>



<p>We already have so many questions, like:</p>



 
 How much should a wallet know about the credentials it holds? How should it make queries to access only the required information? 



 How can users find out which credentials are stored in each wallet, and how should wallets communicate what they contain? 



 Should wallets be able to interoperate to help users find and share entire credentials or just specific details? 
 



 Answers in Regulation? 



<p>I wrote a post about the EU’s Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) a few months ago. The ARF is probably the best source of guidance right now, given its comprehensive approach and the level of collaboration involved. It outlines the expected behaviors of a digital identity wallet, with its development and use supported by the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The ARF is an outline that provides the first blush of a framework for how digital wallets will work in the EU. The European Commission kicked off the work through a Commission Recommendation from June 2021 that urged Member States to develop common standards, technical specifications, and best practices in response to the eIDAS 2.0 regulation. EU Member States sent their experts to join a collaborative process to build the framework.” – <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/05/12/the-eu-digital-identity-architecture-reference-framework-how-to-get-there-from-here/">The EU Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework – How to Get There From Here</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>All that said, ARFs are not specifications. They describe a design, but the details of the implementation, such as what, when, and how different protocols must be used, are left open to interpretation. ARFs lay the groundwork for building specific technical standards, guiding more detailed development. Incredibly helpful, but not enough by itself to help ensure clarity and interoperability.</p>



 Answers in Open-Source Libraries 



<p>OK, so it’s good that there is a reference framework under development. For that matter, there is also at least one effort to build and share code libraries that will support the development of digital identity wallets: the Open Wallet Foundation.</p>



<p>From their website, “The OWF aims to set best practices for digital wallet technology through collaboration on standards-based OSS components that issuers, wallet providers and relying parties can use to bootstrap implementations that preserve user choice, security and privacy.”</p>



<p>They’ve also recently published a “<a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/safe-wallet-sig/blob/main/docs/wallet-safety-guide.md">Wallet Safety Guide</a>” that provides guidelines to developers on safe ways to implement a wallet. The guide offers four areas of focus, or ‘pillars’: Privacy, Security, Supporting Functions, and Governance. It is an incredibly helpful guide and, when combined with the code libraries their members are developing and making available, takes developers one step closer to creating a wallet that is fit-for-purpose and safe for users.</p>



<p>But, similar to an ARF, these aren’t specifications. There are still low-level details that need clarity. Do we have the right protocols that allow all the components of a digital identity wallet to share, in a controlled manner, data about itself and the credentials it contains?</p>



 Answers in Specifications 



<p>But surely there must be something in the standards world that applies to wallets! Well, sort of. There are quite a few specifications about credentials and their properties (for example, <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/specifications/">OpenID for Verifiable Presentation</a> that focuses on presenting identity data securely, or the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> that defines a standard for digital credentials, and of course the work in the <a href="https://ietf-wg-spice.github.io/">IETF SPICE working group</a>.) Some of these are approved standards, some are works in progress.</p>



<p>One of the works in progress is the Digital Credentials API within the W3C. This API aims to create a standardized way for web browsers, wallets, and verifiers to interact, ensuring data privacy during credential exchanges. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timcappalli/">Tim Cappalli</a>, perhaps better known for his championing of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, created a great <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials/blob/main/resources/DigitalCredentialsAPI-Layering-v20240301.pdf">diagram</a> that shows what specific step in the process the DC API work is focused on. It also shows where other specifications need to exist for the other steps.</p>



 Do Standards Really Matter? 



<p>So, there are frameworks. There are open-source libraries. There are credential specs and work to standardize APIs. Why isn’t that enough? Digital identity wallets are part of such a new field, surely building experience this way is a good thing!</p>



<p>That’s a perspective that a lot of people have, and in most situations I would agree with them. Building standards without understanding real-world use cases is an annoying academic exercise that can waste a lot of time. In this case, however, we’re talking about testing out these new ideas in a way that involve personal data. A LOT of personal data. We’re not going to get it right the first time around. So what does that mean for all that personal data? It means a high-probability of exposing that personal data to entities that shouldn’t have it.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>At the end of the closing keynote panel at <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate</a> 2024, <a href="https://www.hindleconsulting.com/">Andi Hindle</a> asked “Are wallets going to be successful? Are they the right path forward?” My answer was “The question is irrelevant.” Yes, that’s a cheeky way of putting it, but digital identity wallets are already here. They are already being implemented. They are not going to go away. And they are introducing new threat vectors that we are hoping regulations will protect us from.</p>



<p>That’s a great model … if everyone and everything wants to abide by the law and agrees to interpret it in the same way. But for a world where that ideal is perhaps not the most realistic, having technical specifications that allow or prevent behavior in a very predictable fashion sure would be nice.</p>



<p>Regulation, like the EU’s eIDAS 2.0, and open-source efforts such as the Open Wallet Foundation are important steps in guiding digital identity wallets. However, we need to complement these efforts with detailed technical standards that ensure wallets operate predictably and securely.

<p>I recently co-authored a white paper about verifiable credentials, with the founder and CEO of the exciting Australian start-up, <a href="https://www.verifiedorchestration.com">Verified Orchestration</a>.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Back-to-the-future_Verified-Orchestration-White-Paper_June-2024.pdf">Back to the Future — Revolutionising Digital ID with new technology and centuries old governance</a>” (PDF) looks at how verifiable credentials enable whole ecosystems to digitise their established governance structures, contexts and rules, as well as their transactions.</p>
<p>This blog is a lightly edited extract from our full paper.</p>

 Verifiable Credentials are new again 
<p>Verifiable Credentials have been around for a long time. You have more than likely used Verifiable Credentials without knowing it. They are commonplace, embedded in mobile phones, payment cards, e-passports, smart phones and smart watches.</p>
<p>The mobile phone SIM is an early example and provides a perfect explainer. The Subscriber Identification Module is both a special purpose integrated circuit and an administrative record. The SIM holds an official copy of your account information and your unique international subscriber number, all of which is digitally signed by your phone company.</p>
<p>The SIM also holds a unique cryptographic key which is used by the handset to digitally sign (in simple terms, “mark”) the start and stop of every call you make. This signature is verifiable by network operators globally and allows them to know which subscriber is making which call from what location, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The global cell phone network could not function without Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>The same goes for global credit card payments. The EMV chip card system replaced magnetic stripe cards long ago, which we were vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Instead of a magnetic stripe card storing and passively transferring cardholder data to a terminal, the chip card carries a Verifiable Credential holding the cardholder data, a cardholder key, and the signature (i.e. endorsement) of the bank which issued the card. Every payment made with the chip card is signed (marked) by the cardholder key, rendering it tamper resistant and globally reconcilable.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are a technology that puts instrumental pieces of information about individuals into the hands of those individuals and empowers them to present that information directly, purposefully and securely.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are decentralised in that the information they carry is valid on its face and can be presented directly, peer to peer, without intermediation.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials and the identity problem 
<p>While Verifiable Credentials have been used for decades, they have been reenergised lately to help solve digital identity. SIMs and EMV cards are highly specialised, dedicated to singular applications, with proprietary standards overseen by industry associations, and bound to physical chips. Today, Verifiable Credentials are being standardised by several global working groups, with a view to extended use cases and applications.</p>
<p>Why the shift to Verifiable Credentials? The way we handle most identity information online has historically followed a distinctly centralised pattern. Instead of putting identity information in the hands the holder, we tend to keep ostensibly official copies in different servers where it sits waiting to be exercised on the holder’s behalf.</p>
<p>To put their digital identity to use, the holder has to activate it on the server somehow (usually by quoting a plaintext username and password) triggering a cascade of actions in their name. Internet banking, online shopping, remote workflows, e-health, e-government travel booking, ticketing and so on all follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>Centralised identity management is odd compared with regular credentials. Imagine if we handled driver’s licenses in the same way as current online identity: the motor vehicle registry would ask you to give your license back to them, and in its place issue you a username and password to access it and release it whenever you happen to need it.</p>
<p>The online world has followed this unreal pattern ever since the “Identity Metasystem” was published in 2006, promoting the canonical arrangement where a Subject and a Relying Party deal with each other via a third-party Identity Provider.</p>
<p>The three-party model is entirely reasonable with respect to the way authoritative information about parties is sourced, however the Identity Metasystem also dictated that most interactions would draw down identity information in real time. That’s the odd part of digital identity.</p>
<p>The new wave of interest in Verifiable Credentials crystalised in July 2018 when the World Wide Web consortium (W3C) released the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 with the byline Expressing verifiable information on the Web.</p>
[For some reason, subsequent iterations of the W3C VC Data Model dropped the mention of “verifiable information”. I thought that was the best thing in the specification.]
 Back to the future 
<p>Verifiable Credentials are a revolutionary digital technology, placing cryptographic keys under the sole control of the credential holder, making credentials highly resistant to theft, counterfeiting or takeover. The new wave of standards now allows customised Verifiable Credentials to be securely carried in mobile digital wallets and used in a range of business applications to reliably prove endorsed facts and figures in their specific contexts.</p>
<p>By decentralising the presentation of credentials, and conserving the established local rules that govern how they are issued and consumed, cryptographically Verifiable Credentials are far less disturbing to business processes than general purpose digital identities and the centralised presentation flows entailed by the Identity Metasystem.</p>

<p>This is the fourth article in a series of technical posts about how Track &amp; Trust works at a component level. To begin with, we’ll outline how our orchestration systems, real-time monitoring, and dashboards work together. Additionally, we’ll explore the challenges we faced and how we overcame them. Quick navigation links to follow-up articles will be provided at the bottom of each article once the series is complete.</p>
 Orchestration Systems and CI/CD 
<p>To manage a large fleet of custom-built mesh node devices, we needed to develop advanced orchestration systems. Specifically, these systems enable us to provision and manage devices efficiently. Furthermore, we created a special approach to real-time monitoring of node health in the field. As a result, Track &amp; Trust includes a full suite of dashboards that we can now use to monitor key performance indicators and display the outputs of our <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">Probabilistic 360° Supply Chain Tracking</a> product. In addition the orchestration systems we built are now fully operational and enable a highly flexible approach to updating and managing the software deployed to our hardware in the field.&nbsp; Let’s jump into how we accomplished this feat.</p>
 The Addressing Challenge 
<p></p>
<p>Most people aren’t aware of this but devices on 4g connections don’t have static IP addresses. The IP addresses are assigned by the constantly shifting cellular towers the mobile device connects to. This is a real problem if you want to set up a software pipeline to trigger updates on mobile or iOT devices. In order to solve this we set up a virtual private network (VPN). This VPN is based on the open source wireguard protocol. Basically it’s a software defined network with <a href="https://tailscale.com/">tailscale</a> under the hood. This approach means using a peer-to-peer mesh network to handle addressing devices inside our mesh network (pretty meta huh?). By routing our network traffic through a VPN we achieved much better security. On top of this we got static virtual addresses. This allowed us to name and manage the machines at the network level.</p>
 Push or Pull Orchestration Systems? 
<p>With the addressing problem solved another challenge popped up. If the machines are only online intermittently, a push approach to updates becomes impossible. This is because when you push the updates it might not reach all the machines. Some machines will inevitably be offline. The solution to this issue was to use a scheduled automation to automatically pull updates from an <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">ansible</a> automation engine. This, in turn, is controlled by a continuous integration and deployment system based around <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/">Semaphore</a>. This enabled us to write code in an integrated development environment, push it to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab</a>, and then trigger a build that the machines pick up. These builds, then deploy automatically on a daily basis whenever the machines happen to come online.</p>
<p>While we were still heavily in development, having this pipeline in place vastly increased our efficiency. We were able to write code and deploy to our custom made IoT hardware basically as though it was sitting in a cloud environment. On top of this we were able to designate groups of machines as dev machines and others as stage or prod machines.&nbsp; This combination allowed us to develop and test both hardware and software independently of production and staging environments. It empowered us to rapidly iterate on the status quo without breaking hardware already in use in the field. Additionally the moment that we were ready to update mesh nodes in the field, we could earmark them to update themselves with well tested code the next time they came online.</p>
 Real-Time Monitoring 
<p></p>
<p>We needed advanced monitoring to easily update our software fleet. To achieve this, we set up an end-to-end observability pipeline using <a href="https://fluentbit.io/">Fluentbit</a>. This pipeline routed data in real-time from our mesh nodes into a database. Subsequently, we displayed real-time data in Grafana for management purposes. This approach enabled us to debug faster without having to SSH into a specific node to get its logs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, our <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> dashboards showed us if all services were up and running, as well as key indicators of device health such as memory usage, temperature, and battery life. We could display logs in the timeframes we were interested in for the machine groups we wanted to monitor. In conclusion, this monitoring technology gave us valuable insights into ensuring our deployed hardware was working correctly and allowed us to fix issues quickly.</p>

<p>Success breeds success, after all. It also inspires copycats.

<p>Dubbed “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a25d2897-b0ce-4ba7-92ed-ff5df09d1b47">Scattered Spider</a>” by some security analysts and UNC3944 or “Muddled Libra” by others, the group of Gen-Z threat actors is believed to have pulled off a series of cryptocurrency heists before breaching and then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/22/mgm-hack-laid-to-star-fraud/">extorting Western Digital</a> and other technology firms over the past few years. Reuters reports the group has been implicated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/power-influence-notoriety-gen-z-hackers-who-struck-mgm-caesars-2023-09-22/">52 attacks</a> spanning multiple industries worldwide since 2022.</p>
<p>Specifics in the casino breaches are still emerging. However, it appears that operatives in the MGM attack used <a href="https://specopssoft.com/blog/mgm-resorts-service-desk-hack/">LinkedIn</a> profile information to impersonate a resort employee in “vishing” calls to an outsourced IT support vendor, requesting access to the employee’s corporate accounts after getting “accidentally” locked out. After gaining entry, the hackers gained super administrator rights to MGM’s Okta environment. They even configured a second identity provider to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and impersonate highly privileged users within the corporate systems.</p>
<p>In a word: diabolical, especially for a group of suspected 17- to 22-year-olds. But as the Washington Post reports, Scattered Spider’s Vegas jackpot also represents a troubling new escalation in the group’s MO. The hackers threw the company into utter chaos by deploying crippling ransomware from notorious Russian cyber gang ALPHV into MGM’s systems. Ten days into the breach, MGM was <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/15/23875113/mgm-hack-casino-vishing-cybersecurity-ransomware">still struggling</a> to repair corporate email, restaurant reservation systems, hotel booking operations, slot machines, and digital keycard access at its Aria, Bellagio, and MGM Grand properties. There’s little reason to believe Scattered Spider isn’t already scouting new prey.</p>
 Gaming the System: Harvesting Passwords, Short-Circuiting MFA 
<p>Ransomware attacks are nothing new, of course. Last year, more than <a href="https://www.getastra.com/blog/security-audit/ransomware-attack-statistics/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20ransomware%20attacks%20per%20year%20is%20around%20620.5,(USD)%20annually%20by%202031.">620 million</a> ransomware attacks worldwide cost victims more than $30 billion. According to Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-train-employees-to-avoid-ransomware">74% of breaches</a> stem from credentials stolen through phishing, vishing, and SIM-swapping attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, stolen passwords are implicated in up to <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/cyber-risk-and-cfos">$25 million</a> in average losses suffered by a third of all businesses that have fallen victim to cyberattacks over the last 36 months. When an ATO leads to a data breach, it can mean an average additional cost of <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/ransomware-and-data-breaches-impacts-continue-to-grow-louder">$9.5 million</a> per incident for US-based companies. ATOs account for more than $300 million in losses annually. And as WAPO points out, Scattered Spider and its Eastern European business partners could worsen matters in coming weeks.</p>
<p>For one thing, you have financially motivated, English-speaking hackers with a proven talent for pulling off <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mgm-and-caesars-hacked-by-scattered-spider-in-span-of-few-weeks-1.1971066">social engineering</a> and data exfiltration schemes. Now add the Russian “ransomware-as-a-service” operatives believed to be behind the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/10/colonial-pipeline-gas-oil-markets/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9">Colonial Pipeline</a> attack and an underworld network as technologically sophisticated as any modern enterprise.</p>
<p>Mix in plentiful targets with outsourced IT support and call center operations crewed by untrained, often short-term employees <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vishing+call+center&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=safari&amp;sca_esv=568238426&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=1046&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=lssRZc73MLeTwPAPuZWKuAM&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOmpfGrMaBAxW3CRAIHbmKAjcQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=vishing+call+center&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MiE3Zpc2hpbmcgY2FsbCBjZW50ZXIyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMggQABiKBRiGAzIIEAAYigUYhgNIvSNQ9hFY3SJwAHgAkAEAmAHuBqABhiOqAQkzLTEuNS4yLjG4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgUQABiiBMICCBAAGIoFGJECwgIOEAAYigUYsQMYgwEYkQLCAgsQABiKBRixAxiDAcICCBAAGIAEGLEDwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAgsQABiKBRixAxiRAsICBxAAGIAEGAqIBgE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-news">vulnerable to vishing</a>. And sprinkle in emerging, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fbi-hackers-are-having-a-field-day-with-open-source-ai-programs">AI-powered phishing</a> and vishing tactics and automated <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">credentials-stuffing</a> technologies. Put it together, and far too many organizations in health care, telecom, government, financial services, and others <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/american-companies-too-vulnerable-to-attacks-like-mgm-hack-cybersecurity-expert-says/">may be vulnerable</a> to an emboldened Scattered Spider and copycat groups. The good news: Organizations can quickly deploy effective defenses. But they’d better move fast.</p>
 No More Rolling the Dice with Outdated Forms of MFA 
<p>According to a recent survey from <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/11/17/marketers-must-be-proactive-data-privacy-maintain-customer-trust">Google and Ipsos</a>, a successful data breach can erode customer trust by as much as 44%. As the MGM and Caesars breaches so vividly illustrate, legacy forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) won’t cut it anymore. Cybercriminal organizations like Scattered Spider have clearly developed inventive ways to acquire login credentials and circumvent things like one-time passcodes and limited biometric authentication systems designed to confirm the legitimate user is attempting to access their account.</p>
<p>The problem: Traditional forms of MFA are built around login passwords and a device instead of the identity of the person accessing an account. Even with Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) and Okta Verify Authenticator, anybody with administrative access can register things like user biometrics to any device they can access—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures altogether.</p>
<p>For some business applications, that may not be a significant risk. But it still leaves the door open to account compromise that puts IT and security teams in reactive mode against data breaches and ransomware after access to systems has already been granted. Fortunately, a new generation of strong, non-phishable biometric identity solutions is changing all that.</p>
 Enter: “Liveness”-based Biometric Authentication 
<p>With traditional forms of MFA becoming so unreliable as a means of identity verification, modern forms of biometric authentication are helping to set a new standard for security and convenience. Solutions certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> , <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics-</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, for instance, use “live” biometric markers tied to a registered identity to provide reliable, strong authentication impervious to account takeover.</p>
<p>These modern biometric solutions offer machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable non-phishable multi-factor authentication when users login to digital services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-mfa/">1Kosmos BlockID</a>, for instance, uses the private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device as a possession factor (ie, “what you have”), while a live facial scan becomes the “what you are” or inherent authentication element. To access a site, app, or system, a live image scan is compared to an image scan captured at the time of enrollment. If they match, the identity of the person of authentication is confirmed to be in fact, the authorized user—and not a bot, deep fake or imposter—with 99.9% accuracy.</p>
<p>This technology is widely available and supports a consistent onboarding and authentication experience into all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems. Any organization can stop phishing, ransomware attacks, and data breaches before hackers can infiltrate accounts. Scattered Spider simply provided an urgent new reason to stop gambling with security now.</p>

<p>Gen Z are giving up their wallets – gladly.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a recent New York Times report, teenagers and twentysomethings<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/technology/personaltech/mobile-wallet-app.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> think wallets are “uncool.”</a> Instead, they’re increasingly storing every payment method, document, or credential they need on their smartphones: credit cards, plane tickets, insurance cards, transit passes, driver’s licenses, and gym memberships.</p><p>Leaving home without a wallet might sound terrifying, but it’s quickly becoming the new normal. Digital driver’s licenses, now available in states like New York and California, are poised to spread nationwide. Businesses and agencies that don’t get up to speed on the new digital identity can risk being left behind: one 19-year-old told the Times that if a store doesn’t accept Apple Pay, she “won’t give them my business.”&nbsp;</p><p>You might assume these verifiable digital credentials are just photos of conventional documents or plastic ID cards. But behind the curtain, there’s a lot more going on, involving advanced cryptography and hardware. While early adopters may care most about the convenience of carrying one less thing, the real point of digital identity is that it’s more private, works better online, and can’t be faked as easily as physical ID.&nbsp;</p><p>So what are these digital cards, really – and how do they work? How are they different from physical ID or credit cards?&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, if they’re just files on a smartphone, why are they trustworthy?</p> The Basics of Digital ID Technology <p>At the most basic level, a verifiable digital credential is not an image, but a string of numbers. They rely upon cryptographic signatures that can be protected by a chip in your smartphone called a “secure element.” This digital ‘signature’ is unique to the credential issuer – for example, all mobile driver’s licenses are digitally signed by a state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.</p><p>These ‘digital signatures’ aren’t simply copies of an image of a human signature. Instead, they’re unique alphanumeric identifiers that confirm a document’s authentic source. Thanks to nearly strong encryption methods, these signatures can’t be reproduced or impersonated by another entity.&nbsp;</p><p>A verifiable digital credential can be checked in various ways by a verifier, such as a rental agent or traffic cop. In many cases, a verifier will already have a record of an issuer’s public signature (that is, an encrypted string of numbers that is uniquely tied to the issuer alone), and will be able to confirm a credential’s authenticity without pinging back to a centralized server. This is significant because it can reduce the digital ‘trail’ left behind when a credential is checked, and that trail is one notable privacy risk of this new all-digital system.</p><p>A physical credential uses quite different techniques to prove its authenticity. Physical anti-fraud measures including micro-printing, holograms, and see-through panels are the first line of defense against fakes. These physical measures work well enough for low-stakes conventional applications, like proving your age to buy alcohol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Physical Credential</p><p>Verifiable Digital Credential</p><p>Secured by holograms, bar codes, and databases</p><p>Secured by unique encrypted signatures</p><p>No batteries required</p><p>Requires at least some device power</p><p>Reveals all printed information when presented</p><p>Allows Selective Disclosure</p><p>Easily spoofed online</p><p>Secure for online use</p><p>Requires “phoning home” for full verification</p><p>Often verifiable without “phoning home”</p><p>Reissued every few years</p><p>Reissued regularly</p><p>Can be faked using AI</p><p>Requires physical infiltration to fake</p>

<p></p><p>But that example might highlight the problem: there are a lot of high school kids with fake IDs. Holograms and other physical security elements are a barrier, but they can be faked – whether in pursuit of underage drinking, or more nefarious goals. So in more serious face-to-face interactions, such as when you’re pulled over by a police officer, your ID may be checked remotely by sending your ID number to a central database. This incurs privacy risk since it effectively creates a record of your location or activities.</p><p>Things like holograms and microtext are particularly easy to fake when an ID is being used online. In fact, a rising wave of online identity fraud, for everything from<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/28/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> opening bank accounts</a> to<a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> applying for jobs</a>, is a major motivation for the shift to digital identity. Verifiable digital credentials, unlike physical cards, are tailor-made for online use: because their confirming signatures are encrypted, they can be reliably confirmed online without the risk of being stolen or copied.&nbsp;</p> Choosing your Data <p>GenZ may love leaving their wallet at home, but the biggest benefit of digital identity for most users will be having more control of your personal data – far, far more control.</p><p>A paper credential has to be handed over all at once to someone checking it, which usually means they’re getting way more information about you than they actually need. That can incur serious privacy risk, for instance if a bartender decides to take an interest in your home address.</p><p>Digital identity instead allows what’s known as “selective disclosure.” <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/california-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California’s mobile driver’s license</a> is fairly typical – when the ID is checked, an app will display what information is being requested and only after authorizing the request, will the information be transmitted.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital systems can also do even more surprising things with data, such as proving that you’re over 21 without disclosing your specific date of birth. These features are huge steps forward in user privacy and data control.&nbsp;</p> Using Digital ID Offline&nbsp; <p>Finally, you might wonder how a digital driver’s license or other credential works when your smartphone (or other device) isn’t connected to the internet. It’s increasingly rare, but there are still plenty of places and moments you just don’t have a wireless connection.</p><p>The good news is that a verifiable digital credential works just as well offline as when you’re connected to the internet. The digital signature that authenticates a credential is, again, stored directly on your device, not on a remote server. By the same token, verifiers will often already have a record of relevant issuer signatures, making it possible that they can verify your ID without an internet connection.</p> Different, and Mostly Better <p>This has been a high-level overview of some of the differences between physical and digital identity cards or other credentials. There is still much, much more going on under the surface, particularly when it comes to grasping how encryption and digital signatures work.</p><p>Hopefully it’s clear even at a glance that there are major differences between digital and physical credentials – including differences that will subtly change how we use and think about identification documents. Many of those differences are clear efficiencies, but a handful may make digital less convenient than paper credentials in particular ways.&nbsp;</p><p>The advantages in user privacy and overall system security will hopefully make those tradeoffs worthwhile, but what’s clear is that the change is just over the horizon.

 Introduction <p>The 2024 Formula 1 Racing Challenge provided data scientists with detailed lap-by-lap data from the current F1 season. The challenge focused on analyzing key trace elements such as tire compounds, pit stop strategies, and lap times. Provided information included telemetry data covering each race, including variables like tire choices, stint lengths, lap times, and pit stop durations. Participants used this information to explore patterns that influenced race outcomes.</p><p>Each participant performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between variables like tire degradation and race performance. They analyzed how tire compounds, such as soft, medium, and hard, impacted lap times over different stints and how teams adjusted pit stop strategies depending on track conditions. Drivers’ positions and lap times were linked to tire management, showing the importance of optimizing tire usage for each race&nbsp;phase.</p><p>The analysis also explored how race length influenced pit stop frequency and tire choice, with drivers using multiple compounds across various stints. The participants applied correlation analysis to measure how decisions made during pit stops impacted final race positions.</p>Top submissions 1st Place: Yunus and&nbsp;Firuze <p>Yunus Gümüşsoy and Firuze Simay Sezgin approached the analysis with a comprehensive view of Formula 1 race strategies, which set their report apart. Although all participants had to analyze tire performance, pit stops, and lap times, Yunus and Firuze’s analysis emphasized how different strategy elements influenced race outcomes. They focused on how teams adapted to changing race conditions, showing how decisions related to tire wear management and pit stop timing played a crucial role in shaping performance.</p><p>Their report went beyond simply presenting data on tire compounds and lap times by examining how race interruptions, such as safety car deployments, forced teams to adjust their real-time strategies. Yunus and Firuze contextualized these strategic decisions within the flow of the race, explaining how early choices like tire selection and pit stop frequency had long-term impacts. By focusing on the timing and reasoning behind these decisions, they provided more profound insights into the effectiveness of the approaches taken by&nbsp;teams.</p><p>The strength of their report lies in how they connected these factors into a cohesive analysis. Instead of viewing tire performance or pit stops as isolated variables, Yunus and Firuze demonstrated how these elements were interdependent and how their combined effects influenced overall race strategy. This integrated approach clarified how teams balanced short-term decisions with long-term race objectives, offering a nuanced view of race strategy that went beyond surface-level observations.</p> 2nd Place: Luca Ordronneau <p>Luca Ordronneau’s report distinguished itself by focusing heavily on the variability of tire strategies across different races. His analysis centered on how teams adjusted their use of tire compounds based on specific track characteristics, such as tire degradation rates and weather conditions.By comparing tire choices across multiple races, Luca highlighted how specific teams favored soft tires for shorter stints on high-degradation tracks. In contrast, others opted for medium or hard tires for endurance on less demanding circuits.</p><p>One of Luca’s key strengths was his attention to how tire strategies shifted throughout the race. He broke down the number of laps completed on each tire compound, revealing patterns teams used to optimize performance over different stints. Luca identified how specific teams started with hard compounds for longer first stints, then switched to softer compounds later in the race when lighter fuel loads allowed for more aggressive driving. This approach demonstrated how tire strategies were not only dependent on race conditions but also on each team’s overall race&nbsp;plan.</p><p>Luca’s report also emphasized the relationship between pit stop frequency and race outcomes. He explored how teams that made fewer stops tended to rely on harder compounds to minimize the time in the pits, while teams that aimed for faster lap times through more frequent stops focused on softer tires. This analysis provided insights into how strategic decisions about tire and pit stop management could either gain or lose time depending on the specific demands of each race, offering a clear view of how tire selection was tailored to maximize performance across varying conditions.</p> 3rd Place: Maria&nbsp;Nacu <p>Maria Nacu’s report stood out through its detailed exploration of how tire choices and pit stop frequency influenced race positions. She focused on how teams managed stints, analyzing the number of laps completed on different tire compounds and the impact this had on race performance. Maria’s approach highlighted the importance of balancing tire wear with performance, showing how teams that favored medium and hard tires could maintain consistent lap times across longer&nbsp;stints.</p><p>A significant aspect of Maria’s analysis was her focus on how tire compound choices affected race outcomes under varying conditions. She examined how drivers adapted their strategies based on the track layout and weather conditions, identifying that some teams used more aggressive strategies with soft tires during shorter stints. In contrast, others relied on harder compounds for longer, more stable performance. Her insights into tire usage under wet and dry conditions provided a comprehensive view of how teams adjusted their approaches during unpredictable races.</p><p>Maria also paid close attention to the relationship between pit stop timing and final race standings. She analyzed how teams that timed their stops efficiently gained significant advantages, particularly when pit stops coincided with race interruptions or safety cars. By demonstrating how teams balanced the need for fresh tires with minimizing time lost in the pits, Maria’s report clearly explained how pit stop strategies influenced race outcomes, tying together tire management and race pacing in a cohesive&nbsp;way.</p> Interesting Facts <p>In the 2024 season, teams like Red Bull Racing and Aston Martin heavily favored medium tire compounds. These compounds provided a balance between speed and durability, making them a popular choice across most circuits.</p><p>Drivers who opted for aggressive tire strategies, particularly using softer compounds early in the race, often faced significant drops in performance by the final stints due to faster tire degradation.</p><p>An analysis of the Monaco Grand Prix revealed a robust correlation between drivers’ starting positions and their final race positions, highlighting the critical importance of qualifying performance on tight circuits.</p><p>Teams that used fewer pit stops but timed them efficiently, especially during critical race phases, often finished in higher positions, highlighting the importance of minimizing pit stop frequency while maintaining tire performance.</p><p>In races with higher tire wear, teams that strategically switched to medium tires during mid-race stints managed to maintain more consistent lap times. In contrast, teams that delayed tire changes experienced significant performance drops toward the end of the&nbsp;race.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Our challenges offer prize pools from $10,000 to $20,000, distributed among the top 10 participants.

  <p>In today's digital landscape, identity is at the forefront of enterprise security. With a growing number of cyberattacks originating from compromised identities, organizations must adopt an identity-first security approach. This approach emphasizes proactive measures over reactive responses, crucial for minimizing risks and safeguarding sensitive information.</p>
<p>Modern technology offers a solution through Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) tools. By integrating ITDR with Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, organizations can effectively identify anomalies and remediate risks. This integration helps build a preemptive security posture, reducing the attack surface and aligning with Zero Trust principles.</p>
<p>John Tolbert, Director of Cybersecurity Research at KuppingerCole, will define the technical requirements for ITDR solutions. He will discuss how ITDR can enhance threat detection, support Zero Trust initiatives, and fortify perimeter security against identity-based threats.</p>
<p>Harshvardhan Lale, VP of Business Development, will delve into ARCON's ITDR engine. He will illustrate its role in detecting, remediating, and responding to identity threats. Additionally, he will highlight how ARCON's solutions secure sensitive information and reduce attack vectors, providing a robust cybersecurity posture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iam-meets-itdr"></a>

<p>A few weeks ago, Microsoft issued its first <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/SFI_September_2024_progress_report.pdf">Secure Future Initiative Progress Report</a>. Launched in November 2023, the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) is Microsoft’s acknowledgement that it needs to drastically improve its cloud security posture and make cybersecurity its top priority. The company has dedicated a substantial chunk of its engineering workforce to the effort ”to address the increasing scale, speed, and sophistication of cyberattacks.” In line with this mandate, a key area of focus is the protection of identities and secrets.</p>  
<p>Identity security continues to be the weakest link in the cyber defenses of the vast majority of organizations. According to <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">recent research</a>, over three-quarters of companies have been hit by identity-related attacks and 69% were breached through authentication processes. One of the main incidents prompting the formation of the SFI <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/11/mitigation-china-based-threat-actor/?ref=runtime.news">was an attack campaign by Storm-0558</a>, in which the threat group used a stolen key that creates multi-factor authentication codes to break into the Microsoft 365 accounts of more than 25 organizations, including government agencies.</p> 
<p>It’s encouraging to see that identity security places prominently in the progress report, with several key areas noting improvement.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishing-Resistant Authentication as a Baseline  
<p>As an organization, Microsoft is making the move to phishing-resistant authentication, using passkeys or certificate-based authentication. They started with their production environment and are in the process of adoption and enforcement across all users in the productivity environment. This is exactly the right approach — tackle your most critical/at-risk systems first and roll out to the broader workforce in stages.</p> 
<p>A phased method also fosters user acceptance. We’ve seen time and time again that <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-to-navigate-passkey-adoption">passkey adoption</a> gains a momentum of its own when users hear from their peers that it actually makes login faster and simpler.&nbsp;</p> 
 New Critical Control: Video-Based Verification  
<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of their identity security overhaul is how they now handle credential recovery situations. Although the industry widely acknowledges that knowledge-based factors are insufficient for verifying employees' identities, many organizations have yet to take action. Microsoft, however, has shifted to using video calls for user verification, aligning with the NIST 800-63-4 identity proofing guidelines for IAL2. Currently in its second public draft, NIST 800-63-4 provides important updates from 800-63-3 to combat modern identity threats leveraging new technologies and best practices.</p> 
<p>By forcing video verification for credential recovery, Microsoft now effectively shuts down one of the fastest growing attack vectors, help desk social engineering. The $100 million dollar attack on MGM Resorts occurred when hackers convinced help desk personnel to reset an employee’s credentials to grant them access.</p> 
<p>Here’s an example of what such a video-based credential recovery process could look like.</p> 
 Improving Secrets Management  
<p>While authentication is a critical part of identity security, secrets management is just as important. Secrets — like API keys, encryption keys, and access tokens — are often the target of sophisticated threat actors. Large organizations like Microsoft, which deliver many services, often struggle with secrets management. The problem is only growing as enterprises are building more applications, more quickly, aided by large language&nbsp; models (LLMs). The SFI emphasizes the need to make&nbsp; secrets management and security a top priority.</p> 
<p>This includes using hardware-based protection to store secret keys and tokens, automated rotation of secrets, and increasing visibility into the context and usage of secrets. This kind of telemetry is essential to detect misuse and forgeries. According to the progress report, Microsoft has completed implementing hardware-based storage for signing keys for public and US government clouds, and has made significant headway on the remaining fronts.</p> 
 The Role of Automation in Identity Security  
<p>Automation is becoming a crucial tool in the fight against identity-related attacks. In the SFI report, Microsoft outlined how they are leveraging automation to detect and respond to identity threats in real-time. From automatically identifying suspicious login behaviors to auto-locking compromised accounts, automation ensures that potential threats are addressed quickly — before they can cause significant damage.</p> 
<p>Organizations can adopt similar strategies by integrating automated identity protection tools that monitor user activity and enforce security policies consistently across all users and systems. These tools can help reduce human error and ensure faster response times to identity threats.</p> 
 Action Steps for Enterprises  
<p>Microsoft’s SFI serves as a reminder for all security and engineering teams to uphold rigorous security standards and adhere to the latest industry best practices. In particular, organizations should take heed and prioritize identity protection in their own security roadmaps.</p> 
<p>For businesses looking to take a page from Microsoft's playbook, here are a few key actions to consider:</p> 
  
  Adopt Phishing-Resistant MFA: Transition away from traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and SMS-based MFA, to phishing-resistant options like passkeys (synced or device-bound) or certificate-based authentication.  
  Implement Video-Based Verification: Follow Microsoft's lead and consider adopting video-based <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/idv-onboarding-recovery">identity verification</a> for critical credential recovery processes to combat social engineering threats.  
  Leverage Automation: Use automated tools for identity verification, risk mitigation, and response to suspicious activity. Automation can act as a force multiplier for your security team, catching threats they may otherwise miss.  
  Enhance Secrets Management: Ensure that secrets like API keys and access tokens are stored securely, regularly rotated, and closely monitored.  
  
<p>HYPR’s Identity Assurance platform combines phishing-resistant MFA, automated identity verification and real-time identity risk mitigation to combat today’s threats as well as those to come. It’s built to fit seamlessly into your current identity stack, whether that’s Microsoft Entra ID or another provider.

				  If you’re able to hold all your data on your phone, what happens if you lose it or it gets stolen?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of decentralized identity is that you now get to hold and control your data instead of a third party putting it in a database. The benefits are enormous in terms of privacy and security: no more tracking, no risk of a data breach putting your personal data at risk.</p>
<p>Scenario one — what happens if you lose your phone? Or someone steals it? Won’t they have access to all your data? And how do you get yours back?</p>
<p>First, you do exactly what you would do if you lost your wallet or passport: You inform your bank and the passport office.</p>
<p>Just as Verifiable Credentials are cryptographically verified, they can be cryptographically revoked. Once revoked, that’s it — they cannot be used by anyone ever again.</p>
<p>This means that you’ll have to go through the relevant identity assurance/KYC process again to get new credentials. This ensures that you — and not someone else — gets your new credential. Not having cloud backup increases security.</p>
<p>Scenario two — what could happen to my data between the point of losing my phone and my credentials being revoked?</p>
<p>There are two layers of security: Biometrics or a passcode to unlock a phone and biometrics or a passcode to unlock the digital wallet containing your credentials.</p>
<p>As long as you don’t use “000000” or “123456” for your passcode, the chances of a random six-digit number being guessed correctly are one in a million. Now add in a second different passcode for accessing your digital wallet and factor in phone lockouts after a certain number of incorrect guesses.</p>
<p>Similarly, someone who finds a lost phone or randomly steals one is also not going to be able to simulate your biometrics to access the phone from simply having your physical phone.</p>
<p>In short, when you combine the security benefits of holding your own data with the seamless authentication provided by cryptography, all wrapped in multiple layers of biometric-passcode security, Verifiable Credentials represent a massive net gain on how we currently manage identity online and off.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Today marks a critical deadline for all EU member states: October 17, 2024, the date by which the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">NIS2 Directive</a> must be transposed into national law. For some, this milestone has been met with progress and precision. For others, particularly Germany, the delay in implementation highlights a significant gap between political rhetoric and actionable cybersecurity policy.</p>
 Why NIS2 Matters 
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80816/eu-nis2-directive">NIS2 Directive is</a> designed to strengthen cybersecurity across the European Union by establishing a uniform baseline of security measures, focusing on critical infrastructure, incident reporting, and cross-border coordination. The Directive itself is a powerful tool, but there’s a catch: it requires individual member states to translate its provisions into national law, a process that leaves room for delays and inconsistencies. Had it been passed as a regulation; its immediate applicability would have ensured more streamlined and consistent compliance. But as it stands, the uneven pace of implementation across member states threatens to undermine its potential impact.</p>
<p>Germany, currently six months behind schedule, exemplifies the challenges in turning political promises into tangible action. While the cybersecurity conversation remains a popular talking point in speeches, the urgency of addressing real-world cyber risks seems underestimated. And in a world where cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and frequent, every delay leaves critical infrastructure more exposed.</p>
 Missing Pieces: The “Durchführungsverordnung” 
<p>As usual: I am not a lawyer, but one of the most pressing challenges for organizations preparing for NIS2 compliance is obviously the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/challenging-the-easy-path-why-nis2-demands-a-new-compliance-mindset">absence of detailed regulatory guidance</a>. Some legal instruments are still missing, something like a “Durchführungsverordnung” (Implementing Regulation) as they exist on an EU level. This should provide the concrete, actionable details on how the directive’s rules are to be enforced and what specific technical standards must be met.</p>
<p>Such a specification is expected and needed to offer the necessary administrative and procedural details at the national level, ensuring organizations know exactly what is expected of them. In Germany, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/draft-documents-nis2-compliance-challenge">having access to such a detailed document</a> is crucial for organizations to understand their obligations under NIS2. Without it, they just cannot develop the processes they need to comply effectively, and that puts both their operations and security posture at risk.</p>
 The Need for Well-Defined Notification Duties 
<p>A core aspect of NIS2 is the requirement for organizations to report cybersecurity incidents, especially those that threaten critical infrastructure. However, the details of what exactly constitutes a reportable incident remain unclear. This “fuzziness” in definitions means organizations could either over-report, leading to unnecessary administrative burden, or under-report, leaving serious threats unnoticed.</p>
<p>Beyond incident reporting, it’s essential that organizations receive timely feedback from authorities. A well-defined&nbsp;feedback loop&nbsp;allows businesses to adjust their security strategies based on emerging threats and evolving attack vectors. But, until clear guidance is issued, these processes remain underdeveloped, leaving companies unsure of how to respond to incidents and how to improve their cybersecurity posture in real-time.</p>
 Going Beyond ISO 27001: Meeting NIS2’s Requirements 
<p>Many organizations might think that being compliant with&nbsp;ISO 27001&nbsp;or other established cybersecurity frameworks is enough. While ISO 27001 offers a strong foundation - focusing on risk management, information security, and control structures - it falls short of the specific requirements imposed by NIS2. The Directive goes further, introducing mandatory reporting obligations, sector-specific rules, and increased regulatory oversight. In short, organizations need to go beyond their traditional control frameworks to fully meet NIS2’s stringent demands.</p>
 More Than Just Technology: A Holistic Approach to Compliance 
<p>One of the most underestimated aspects of NIS2 is its focus on a&nbsp;holistic approach&nbsp;to cybersecurity. Compliance isn’t just about having <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc81008/nis2-eu-network-and-information-security-directive">the right technology</a> in place; it’s about creating a robust framework that includes&nbsp;policies, processes, organizational structure, and&nbsp;people. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in ensuring that an organization can not only prevent incidents but respond effectively when they occur.</p>
 
 Policies: Clear and enforceable security policies are the foundation of any cybersecurity strategy. These policies need to be aligned with both the organization’s goals and regulatory demands, providing a formal framework that governs the use of technologies and the response to incidents. 
 Processes: Incident response, risk assessments, and continuous monitoring must be integrated into daily operations. These processes define how threats are detected, reported, and mitigated, ensuring that organizations are prepared to meet NIS2’s strict reporting timelines. 
 Organizational Structure: Cybersecurity efforts must be coordinated across the entire organization. This includes having clear governance structures, with defined roles for key personnel such as the&nbsp;CISO, compliance officers, and dedicated security teams. 
 People: Human error is often the weakest link in cybersecurity. NIS2 emphasizes the need for regular&nbsp;training and awareness programs, ensuring that all employees - not just IT staff - are aware of the risks and know how to respond to threats. 
 
 The Clock Is Ticking 
<p>Despite the delays in many EU member states, the urgency to act is real. Organizations that have not yet begun their compliance journey are at significant risk, and even those that are somewhat prepared still face challenges in aligning with the directive’s requirements. Waiting for final regulations to be fully in place is not an option - time is running out, and achieving compliance will require significant time, effort, and resources.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Germany has officially launched the German part of the EUDI Wallet initiative, a significant advancement in digital identity management as part of the broader European eIDAS 2.0 regulation. The recent announcement made by the German Ministry of the Interior was about the way forward until the planned availability in 2027 and openness for private 3rd parties to also provide certified EUDI wallets in Germany.</p>
<p>The EUDI Wallet initiative, with every member state being obliged to provide such wallets to the citizens by 2027, enables citizens to carry secure digital IDs on their smartphones, making the digital future more accessible. Yet, the impact of this move extends far beyond simply digitizing ID cards; it opens up a world of potential for decentralized identity, cross-border verification, and secure data sharing.</p>
 Flexibility Through Openness: A New Paradigm for Digital Identity 
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the EUDI Wallet is its open architecture. Instead of being limited to a single governmental solution, users will be able to choose from various wallets provided by both public and private entities. This marks a departure from older, more restrictive digital identity systems. The result? A competitive marketplace where innovation can flourish, but backed by standards for interoperability. Users will benefit from wallets tailored to specific needs, whether for travel, finance, or even healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of private providers fosters an environment where innovation is not only encouraged but essential. For instance, wallets could soon support more than just digital identification—they could incorporate advanced functionalities like micropayments or even specialized uses in sectors like healthcare, finance, or mobility. Envision having a travel wallet or finance wallet for everything you require for these use cases.</p>
 Innovation and Competition: The Role of Private Providers 
<p>The key to this transformation lies in the involvement of private companies, which will create new opportunities for competition and innovation. The OpenWallet Foundation, led by Daniel Goldscheider, is already laying the groundwork for open-source, interoperable wallets. This approach could lead to highly dynamic digital wallets that are capable of interacting seamlessly across different sectors and services.</p>
<p>However, the exact requirements for private wallet providers remain a bit unclear. Certification processes and regulatory hurdles could pose challenges. These will need to be addressed to ensure the widespread adoption of private wallets while maintaining security and interoperability standards.</p>
 Beyond Basic Functionality: A Multi-Purpose Digital Wallet 
<p>While traditional digital wallets have often been confined to single-purpose applications, the EUDI Wallet aims to break this mold. The open ecosystem allows for multi-functional wallets that can serve various purposes. Imagine using a single wallet not just for banking, but also for travel bookings, healthcare appointments, and even identity verification across borders.&nbsp; Or, as mentioned above, feature-rich apps involving a wallet for such use cases.</p>
<p>This versatility could prove transformational for both consumers and businesses. The ability to incorporate decentralized identities, secure payments, and cross-border functionality into a single solution could unlock significant economic value and streamline a range of processes.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: A Game-Changer 
<p>Decentralized identities are a cornerstone of this vision. Instead of being controlled by a central authority, decentralized identities allow individuals to have greater control over their personal data. This could revolutionize the way we interact with digital services, providing a higher level of security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized IDs will also play a critical role in broader, more complex use cases. For instance, secure data sharing and cross-border verification processes will benefit immensely from this technology. This is not just about convenience, but about creating a more secure, interoperable digital future.</p>
 The Path Forward: What’s Next for the EUDI Wallet? 
<p>Despite the remaining uncertainties, one thing is clear: the EUDI Wallet has the potential to redefine how we think about digital identity. Initiatives like eIDAS 2.0 and the OpenWallet Foundation are laying the groundwork for a future where digital identity systems are not just interoperable but truly dynamic.</p>
<p>As more complex use cases come into play, the value of this technology will become increasingly apparent. For instance, as highlighted in my <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/era-of-ai-and-decentralization-eic24">EIC keynote</a>, the broader application of wallets—whether for decentralized identity verification, application to loans at banks, or onboarding employees—will unlock significant benefits for both users and the economy at large. Germany’s openness for supporting 3rd party EUDI Wallet is hopefully just the beginning, and we can expect significant advancements in digital identity in the coming years.</p>
<p>The EUDI Wallet represents a bold move toward a more open, flexible, and innovative digital identity ecosystem. With the involvement of both public and private providers, the future of digital identity looks promising—and it’s happening now.</p>

<blockquote><p>Northern Block Secures Funding from Natural Resources Canada to Drive Digital Trust in the Mining Sector Through Sustainability Credentials, Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency and Global Accountability.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have been awarded grant funding from Natural Resources Canada’s (NRCan) Global Partnerships Initiative, part of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/canadas-critical-minerals-strategy.html">Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy</a>. This investment is not only a testament to the <a href="https://northernblock.io/blog/utilising-digital-credentials-to-promote-responsible-business-conduct">prior milestones</a> we have accomplished in the mining ecosystem, but also an exciting leap forward in our mission to ‘credentialize’ sustainability data and enhance supply chain transparency across Canada’s critical minerals sector.</p>
 Transforming the Mining Ecosystem with Digital Credentials 
<p>Our ongoing work in the mining sector has centered around digitally transforming key sustainability metrics, particularly those aligned with the <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM)</a> standard, into standards-based digital credentials. These credentials allow mining companies to demonstrate their commitment to responsible business practices and make that data securely available to key stakeholders, including investors and supply chain participants. The momentum we’ve built with the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada (MAC)</a>, a strategic partner of ours, has been pivotal. We are now building on the successes we’ve already demonstrated, such as enabling mining operators to self-issue verified TSM reports as digital credentials. This progress was also made possible by the leadership and investment of the BC Government in the Energy and Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) program. This has resulted in greater transparency and trust in the supply chain, as highlighted in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/blog/utilising-digital-credentials-to-promote-responsible-business-conduct">previous work</a>. This new federal funding will further accelerate the scale and impact of our efforts, ensuring that digital credentials become an integral part of the global mining ecosystem.</p>
<p>With NRCan’s support, Northern Block will continue to streamline and digitize the reporting processes for MAC members, transforming sustainability reports into secure, digital credentials. These efforts directly support global sustainability initiatives like the <a href="https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/">United Nations Transparency Protocol</a>, ensuring that data from initiatives such as TSM can be integrated into digital product passports, and contribute to more transparent and sustainable supply chains globally.</p>
 Expanding the Reach of TSM with Digital Product Passports 
<p>Our efforts, led by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) and the Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) standard, are setting the benchmark for sustainability data in the mining industry. TSM has taken the lead in creating verifiable digital credentials that enhance transparency and trust across the entire supply chain. As these digital credentials gain traction, we’re seeing increasing interest from other global standards bodies, eager to follow the path MAC has paved.</p>
<p>Our work ensures that TSM credentials will serve as a foundational data source for emerging digital product passports, making it easier for mining companies to securely share critical information on sustainability, ethical sourcing, and environmental impact. By positioning TSM at the forefront, we’re not only adding value to MAC members but also shaping the future of supply chain transparency for critical minerals worldwide.</p>
 Exciting Releases Ahead for 2024 
<p>As we look ahead, we are excited about the upcoming releases in Q4 2024, developed in partnership with the Mining Association of Canada and several of their key members, including major mining operators. These developments will further solidify the role of digital credentials in the mining industry and reinforce Canada’s leadership in responsible mining practices.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support from Natural Resources Canada, we now have a three-year roadmap that allows us to double down on building and expanding this ecosystem. This grant represents a significant validation of the work we’re doing and the value we’re creating, not just for our current partners but for the entire critical minerals ecosystem. We’re eager to leverage this momentum and continue driving innovation across the mining sector.</p>

  In the post-COVID era, higher education institutions face unprecedented challenges in managing student matriculation and access governance. With IT departments stretched thin and an influx of in-person students, the risk of over-provisioning and compliance violations has skyrocketed. Balancing efficiency with data security and privacy concerns with FERPA, HIPAA, and other regulations has become a critical issue for HigherEd CIOs and IT professionals.

				  Biometric authentication is a brilliant solution to the problem of passwords and usernames for identity access management that replicates one of the worst features of password management. Now, that feature threatens to create havoc across the world’s biometric identity systems. We discuss how Verifiable Credentials can solve the problem.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>The value of biometrics in authentication</p>
<p>You can’t forget your face; it’s always with you, making it a powerful way to manage identity access. But, realistically (which is to say, outside Mission Impossible movies), you can’t reset your face if its digital copy gets stolen. Unfortunately, that’s just the risk we’ve created by storing biometric data for verification in centralized databases.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t have to scrap your existing biometric authentication systems.</p>
<p>Biometrics are fast, cool, unforgettable (in the password sense), and easy to use. We want you to use them, we just want to be sure that your end users don’t pay the price.</p>
<p>How biometrics work</p>
<p>Traditional biometric systems are very simple. There are two pieces that work together, enrollment and verification.</p>
<p>Enrollment is where your biometric data is collected, it usually requires a few different tries of scanning your face or finger to collect a few samples so that the system can compute a template with some allowance for variation. This template is then stored in a database to be accessed and compared to information you present when trying to access the system.</p>
<p>When a biometric is collected at an access point through a scan, it is compared to the stored biometric template. Most systems are not looking for an exact match; instead, they compare key points in the template, such as the position of the swirls and loops in your fingerprint. The combination of the variation in individual biometrics and the selection of key biometric points allows for accurate identification given random variations during scanning —&nbsp;such as a finger not quite aligned in the same way as when the template scan was conducted.</p>
<p>Databases are the downfall of biometrics (and really any user data you’re trying to keep secure)</p>
<p>The problem facing biometric systems is the same one that has plagued logins and passwords since their inception. The reliance on a centralized database for the system to function and the fact that storing all this biometric data in one place is an attractive target for a data breach.</p>
<p>This turns a security problem into an existential risk for biometric databases because, unlike passwords and logins that can be quickly changed in the event of a breach, people’s biometrics are largely unchangeable and will continue to be compromised. Once a database has been compromised and the information is out there it becomes easy for bad actors to generate false positives that will work on any other systems tied to the user’s biometrics.</p>
<p>Solving the problem (bring your own biometrics)</p>
<p>When biometrics were first introduced there wasn’t really a good way around the database problem; but since then, we have developed Verifiable Credentials, which offer a tamper-proof, decentralized way for people to hold their information and biometrics themselves on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>The process looks largely the same: Your system captures a person’s biometric, it creates a template in the same way as normal; but instead of saving that template in a database, it is issued to the person or guardian inside a Verifiable Credential.</p>
<p>As the template is digitally signed, it cannot be altered without being detected. And because Verifiable Credentials use cryptography to prove who they were issued by, you can be certain the template was issued by your systems or another source you trust.</p>
<p>This means that when a person presents themselves for a biometric check, they also present their biometric template from their Verifiable Credential. The verifying party simply compares to see if both match without the need to store any biometric data.</p>
<p>And because there is no personal information stored, there are a ton of benefits: easier data privacy compliance, lower liability, no possibility of mass compromise, and more privacy, security, and control for the end user. Most importantly, you keep all the benefits of biometric authentication.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>In three years, the familiar&nbsp;CЄ mark will take on a new role: signaling compliance with robust cybersecurity standards. While this might sound like just another consumer-facing regulation, it’s actually part of a much larger transformation under the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). This legislation is not merely about putting a sticker on products; it marks a shift in how security is integrated into the lifecycle of everything from household devices to vehicles. If there’s software in a product, security must be built in from the very beginning—by design, not as an afterthought.</p>
 From NIS2 to UNECE R155: Security by Design 
<p>The CRA sits alongside other crucial regulations aimed at fortifying Europe’s digital ecosystem. The&nbsp;NIS2 Directive, for example, broadens the scope of the original NIS directive to include critical sectors like healthcare, energy, and transportation, enhancing the security of network and information systems. It enforces stricter requirements for incident reporting and proactive risk management, directly addressing today’s complex threat landscape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the automotive sector, UNECE regulations&nbsp;R155&nbsp;and&nbsp;R156&nbsp;are revolutionizing how vehicles are secured. UNECE R155 requires manufacturers to implement cybersecurity management systems (CSMS) to prevent hacking and cyberattacks, while UNECE R156 ensures that vehicle software remains up to date, mandating secure over-the-air (OTA) updates. These regulations cover both new and existing models, forcing manufacturers to rethink how they protect connected vehicles throughout their entire lifecycle.</p>
 Cybersecurity Costs Hit Fiat 500 
<p>These regulatory shifts are already making waves in industry. A very tangible example is Fiat’s decision to end production of the <a href="https://www.watson.ch/digital/elektroauto/834290498-fiat-500-wird-eingestellt-aus-fuer-den-retro-kleinwagen-aus-italien">beloved Fiat 500</a>, after 17 years and millions of units sold. The reason is that the costs of retrofitting older models to meet the stringent UNECE cybersecurity standards, specifically R155 and R156, proved too high. Fiat is not alone; other manufacturers may also find it challenging to upgrade their legacy systems to meet new requirements, signaling the profound impact these regulations will have across the automotive sector.</p>
 The Cyber Resilience Act: Security at the Core 
<p>The CRA is part of a broader regulatory effort to ensure that every digital product—not just cars—meets strict security standards. More than a compliance measure, the CRA enforces security-by-design, a principle that requires manufacturers to anticipate and mitigate cyber threats from the earliest stages of product development. This shift has implications far beyond product safety; it also affects the entire supply chain, as vendors and partners must meet the same high standards.</p>
<p>No longer can companies afford to treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. It’s now at the heart of digital business, impacting not only product design but also how products are maintained and updated over time. In an era where every connected device is a potential target, this approach ensures resilience in the face of evolving threats.</p>
 Future-Proofing Digital Europe 
<p>What we’re seeing is a clear message from the EU: cybersecurity must be baked into every layer of product development and supply chain management. The CE mark may be the most visible sign of this change, but behind it lies a robust legal framework designed to safeguard the future of Europe’s digital economy. From vehicles to consumer devices, the CRA and related regulations like NIS2 and UNECE R155/R156 are reshaping how businesses design, deploy, and secure their products.</p>
<p>The era of retrofitting old models with new security patches is coming to an end. For businesses (and every business is a digital business nowadays), now is the time to embrace cybersecurity as a central pillar of their product strategy and corporate strategy. Anything less, and they risk not just regulatory penalties but losing the trust of consumers in a world where digital safety is paramount.</p>

                             <a href="https://tokeny.com/category/blog/">Blog</a> 15 October 2024   RWA and DePIN: The Future of Assets and Infrastructure    
	 
		 
			 What is RWA? 
<p>In the blockchain world, Real World Assets (RWA) refer to tangible, physical assets with economic value, such as real estate, gold, vehicles, and art. Tokenizing these assets offers three main benefits: it opens the door for more people to invest by lowering barriers to entry, enables easy transferability—similar to sending a PayPal transaction—and allows the assets to be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as providing liquidity in an AMM or using them as collateral to borrow tokenized cash.</p>
<p>To fractionize the ownership of these RWA, it often turns the assets into financial instruments. Typically, this involves creating an investment vehicle like a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to hold the underlying asset. Tokenization is the process of representing ownership of financial instruments such as shares or debts of the SPV as tokens on a blockchain, allowing for digital purchase, self-custody, easy transfers, and usage of assets. These tokens represent securities and must comply with strict regulatory rules, only qualified investors meeting regulatory conditions can trade and hold them.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In most cases, ERC-20 standard should not be used for tokenizing RWA as ERC-20 tokens are permissionless, allowing the transfer to anyone without restriction. However, bearer instruments are illegal in most jurisdictions. This is where permissioned tokens using the ERC-3643 standard become vital. They ensure that only qualified users can hold them, which is crucial for compliance with regulations.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>RWA market is one of the fastest growing markets in the blockchain industry that has reached an all-time high of $12 billion tokenized, according to a Binance Research <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/rwas-a-safe-haven-for-onchain-yields">report</a>. However, this figure doesn’t fully capture the market’s scale.</p>

		 
	 
                   
	 
		 
			 “At Tokeny alone, we’ve facilitated the tokenization of more than $32 billion worth of assets onchain.” 
<p>Shurong Li, Head of Marketing at Tokeny</p>

			<p>Many of our clients choose not to make their data publicly available, as these are often private assets. Additionally, large institutions face challenges in accepting onchain cash due to regulatory uncertainty and they still prefer to invest in fiat. Given the current scale, we expect this market to grow significantly in the coming years.</p>
 What is DePIN? 
<p>Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) is an emerging concept where decentralized networks are used to manage and operate physical infrastructure. These networks include cloud services, wireless networks, sensor networks, mobility and energy networks. DePIN networks incentivize individuals to contribute to the bootstrapping phase of growth without relying on outside resources. This means individuals are incentivized by tokens to build up the supply of infrastructure without the need for centralized operators. DePIN addresses the issue that traditional centralized infrastructure, operated by corporations, requires a significant investment of time and money for both building and maintaining infrastructure, making it nearly impossible for individuals to build networks.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>The main drive of DePIN systems is for Web3 companies to outsource all the building and maintenance of these network infrastructures. Take Hivemapper, for example, a decentralized digital map of the world (sensor networks). They provide users, known as “mappers” with a dashcam to drive around and capture real life images of everything they pass. This is one of the methods to build and maintain the infrastructure of this network. The incentive for the individuals contributing is earning tokens that hold monetary value, which can be redeemed to access premium map data and participate in governance decisions. The more a user contributes, the more infrastructure is built and maintained, the more tokens they receive as incentive.</p>
 What is the Difference Between the Two? 
<p>Although RWAs and DePIN both interact with the physical world, they have different use cases and operate in distinct ways. These differences include their purpose, the markets they operate in, the regulations involved, and the concept of ownership versus contribution.</p>
<p>RWA operates in the financial sector, involving tangible real-world assets like real estate, gold, or art that are converted into tokens representing fractionalized ownership. These tokens can be bought, sold, and traded among authorized investors.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “To ensure compliance, RWAs must strictly follow regulations, often using permissioned tokens such as ERC-3643.” 
<p>Luc Falempin, CEO of Tokeny</p>

<p>Luc Falempin, CEO of Tokeny</p>

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			<p>The goal of RWA is to democratize the investment and ownership of physical assets, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors through tokenization.</p>
<p>In contrast, DePIN focuses on decentralizing the construction and maintenance of networks in the infrastructure sector. Instead of tokenizing existing assets, DePIN networks incentivize individuals to contribute physical resources such as server hosting, energy storage, and data collection. Contributors earn tokens that often provide exclusive benefits and hold monetary value in exchange for their participation. DePin faces fewer regulatory challenges since it involves contributions to infrastructure rather than ownership of assets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, both RWA and DePIN require onchian identity management. For RWA, onchain identity ensures compliance by verifying KYC status and guarantees unlosable ownership. Tokenized RWAs also have their onchain identity, allowing for enriching the data associated with the assets themselves. In the case of DePIN, without robust verification of devices or service providers contributing to the network, there’s a risk of payouts being claimed fraudulently, which can harm the network’s performance. This makes decentralized identity (DID) frameworks crucial for DePIN as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.onchainid.com/">ONCHAINID</a>, an open-source DID framework used in ERC-3643, is an excellent solution. A verifier can conduct necessary checks and issue verifiable credentials as proof. This ensures that only properly functioning devices and valid contributions to the network are recognized, maintaining the integrity and sustainability of the system and enhancing its overall performance.</p>
 What is the Opportunity to Make the Two Work Together? 
<p>Combining RWA and DePIN presents a significant opportunity to transform both financial investments and infrastructure development. Together these sectors can push forward growth and innovation in the form of a hybrid ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tokenization of Infrastructure: Co-Ownership of DePIN Devices: The real-world assets, devices, such as renewable energy systems or critical IoT infrastructure, can be costly for individual investors. By tokenizing the ownership, for example through the units or shares of a fund that will invest in one or many DePIN devices, people can co-own multiple DePIN devices. The key benefits are listed below.</p>
 
 Improved Accessibility: Allowing individuals to co-own expensive infrastructure devices. This opens up investment opportunities for a wider pool of participants, making it possible for people to co-own high-value assets like solar panels or data nodes. 
 Enhanced Transferability: Unlike physical devices, which can be difficult to sell or exchange, fractional ownership can be more easily traded. Moreover, tokenization enables peer-to-peer transfer to enhance transferability and eventually increase liquidity of the assets. 
 New Opportunities and Stability of DePIN Network: Beyond just owning a piece of the infrastructure, the tokenized shares can also be used in DeFi applications. Investors can provide liquidity, stake, or use these tokens as collateral to generate additional financial yield, unlocking even more value from their co-ownership in the infrastructure assets while not needing to sell the devices to ensure stability of the DePIN Network. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>In conclusion, RWAs and DePIN, while distinct in their purpose, share common ground in turning the physical world digital. The opportunity to combine these concepts opens the door for innovative applications in finance, infrastructure, and decentralized economies, creating more accessible, efficient, and resilient systems for managing physical assets and infrastructure globally. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the synergy between RWAs and DePIN could be crucial in shaping the next wave of decentralization.</p>

 #1 Are we coding too soon? — Day&nbsp;3 <p>This blog is the first in a series documenting the Re:Permissioning the City(PtC) product development journey. In the spirit of “working out loud”, the series aims to share our ongoing progress, learnings, and reflections on building a digital permissioning system designed to unlock underutilised spaces in the city for civic use, through introducing participatory and distributed forms of spatial governance.</p> Day 3: Product scoping — balancing strategy and feasibility <p>On the third and fourth days of the workshop, we started sketching wireframes based on the user journey. This required merging the two scenarios we developed, creating a coherent flow, and listing out both the technical and UI/UX requirements.</p><p>Once we layed out the entire journey, we quickly realised that a significant part of what we were building was in fact quite similar to a typical booking platform. There were two parts of the system that were interdependent: 1) a booking system that allows a user to list spaces and book events, and 2) a new permissioning system that introduces alternative ways to approve bookings, allows users to be part of permissioning groups and create&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Due to restrictions of time and capacity (4 months of development time), we had to prioritise, which meant we had to decide which part of the system we were going to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Through some debate, we came up with three potential strategies and decided to choose&nbsp;one.</p><p>Maximise Experimentation<br>In this approach, we aimed to minimise the necessary development efforts, particularly for features already common in the market. By doing so, we could redirect our development capacity towards creating interactive prototypes that facilitate permissioning experiments. This included exploring scenarios such as “How would a liability group come together?” and “How would this permissioning group share decision-making responsibilities?” (Focusing on permissioning system)</p><p>Risks:</p>  There is a risk that funders may not support this approach, as the booking system may not be fully functional.  The development timeline could be delayed because the prototype is not fully specified yet, meaning the development team would need to wait until the prototype design is finalised.  <p>Opportunities:</p>  Focusing on experimentation benefits future pathway building especially innovation funding  <p>Maximise Potential for Real Users<br>This strategy recognises the significant impact of involving real users at the end of the process. We proposed developing a functional booking system while continuing to explore the formation of liability groups and the permissioning mechanism through design workshops. (Focusing on booking&nbsp;system)</p><p>Risks:</p>  Misalignment with the broader Dm identity and portfolio: investing too much time in developing features that are already available in the market may not align with Dm’s vision and strategic goals.  Deadline Pressure: even if we allocate all development capacity to building a fully functioning system, we may still struggle to meet the 4-month deadline.  Project objectives: We want to validate our concept around permissioning through this first phase, and we cannot do that by building a booking&nbsp;system.  Funding risks: it depends on what kind of funding we are going for, but innovation funders will want to see the innovation.  <p>Opportunities:</p>  Foundation for future experimentation: Developing functional software provides Dm with solid tools and a platform for future experimentation.  High-quality delivery: This approach ensures that we deliver a fully functional system, likely to perform well in assessments.  User ready: If we can have real users, we can apply for other types of funding e.g. specifically for product development  <p>Interoperable Permission Engine<br>In this direction, we focused on the importance of a fully functional user flow while dedicating our development efforts to creating versatile digital tools for experimentation. This includes developing an interoperable permissioning plugin compatible with existing booking systems. (Focusing on permissioning system)</p><p>Risks:</p>  Can end up developing all the fullstack systems for the&nbsp;MVP.  It’s uncharted territory so we might underestimate the development time&nbsp;needed.  <p>Opportunities:</p>  Can focus on building more value aligned outcomes.  Can acquire a broader range of potential users than running a single platform ourselves.  Can provide more dynamic types of usage by having some flexibility on scopes of entities who host the permission engine.  <p>We ended up choosing the third option, which was suggested by our backend developer Donghun. The reason why we documented this lengthy debate and decision-making process is because it triggered a lot of critical, fundamental questions and areas for clarification.</p> What does product development in Dark Matter Labs look&nbsp;like? <p>Triggered by the debate around feasibility and vision, we had a chance to reflect on the tensions caused by different priorities. As a collective of individuals primarily trained in architecture, design, and policy, Dark Matter Labs as an organisation doesn’t resemble a typical tech start up. Then what does a product development journey look like in our unique context? How is the product that we are striving to develop different, and how should the development journey be adapted to work in our current team dynamics, without compromising delivery? We don’t assume that we would be able to answer these questions right now, but we document here some of the reflections that emerged in our conversations during the workshop.</p><p>How is our product different?</p><p>We all agree that Dark Matter Labs is not a tech start-up trying to make a product that responds to market demands. We are more of a strategic design and research lab interested in elucidating systemic problems and developing experimental products that can provoke, and perhaps, solve some of these fundamental issues. In recent years, we’ve moved beyond crafting narratives that provoke thought, to actually building products that do both — provoke and solve problems. <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">Circulaw</a> is a good example of such a product built with actual users in mind. Having developers on the team who were involved in building products like Circulaw (and other market-ready solutions) gave us the opportunity to raise critical questions.</p><p>Product development at Dm presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly when addressing systemic issues rather than simply filling market gaps or meeting unmet needs. Can we really build a product that addresses the problem of ownership and centralised governance? How far can we go in embedding our critical (but speculative) ideas into a product? Will people even understand and appreciate it? (Even our blogs are notoriously difficult to read). Who is our primary audience or user? Building a product that requires significant upfront resources and diverse capabilities compels us to answer these questions from the&nbsp;outset.</p><p>Are we coding too&nbsp;soon?</p><p>During the workshop, we had an opportunity to reflect critically on our current approach to transitioning projects into products, particularly how this process affects developers within Dark Matter Labs. One key takeaway was the importance of having a robust paper prototyping phase to validate key concepts and hypotheses before coding begins (tensions could emerge when project holders underestimate the labour of coding — and the labour of having to re-write it). This phase, alongside thorough user interviews and testing, would help refine smaller details early on. From a developer’s perspective, it’s much easier to focus on how to build something if the what has already been clearly defined. As Donghun pointed out, getting these what questions sorted beforehand allows developers to focus on building a product with technical integrity, without worrying about shifting&nbsp;goals.</p><p>There are definitely advantages to loosely structured projects within Dm which have been our default pattern — the ability to adapt to changing contexts, being open to radical iteration — but product development requires a different level of investment and nature of collaboration, which in turn demands new structures and practices. Perhaps it’s useful to clearly distinguish the paper-prototype phase supported by workshops, before attempting to start building digital prototypes.</p><p>We also realised there was room for improving how strategic designers and developers work together. How can we ensure smoother handovers from concept to execution? Developers thrive when they work on projects with real-world applications — projects that go beyond one-off workshop tools and are sustained long enough to generate meaningful data for future iterations. This sense of continuity and contribution is crucial for developer growth. Ideally, we envision a scenario where designers and developers co-create provocative projects that go live to meet real user needs, operating for a sufficient time to gather the data necessary for iteration and future improvements. This way, developers get a sense of growth and contribution, knowing their work has a lasting&nbsp;impact.</p> Wrapping up the workshop and looking&nbsp;ahead <p>This concludes the documentation of our first in-person workshop focused on product scoping. It wasn’t a very structured workshop at the beginning, but we managed to build the necessary structures and processes that allowed us to move to the next&nbsp;stage.</p>  Defining the&nbsp;horizons  Deliberating on core principles and values of the product (more suggestions collected throughout the&nbsp;week)  Designing two types of scenarios and user&nbsp;journeys  Merging two scenarios into one user journey and sketching paper wireframes  Prioritising what to develop/code  Discussing pathway strategies  Ideating around branding/identity  Identifying questions for the future (collected throughout the workshop)  <p>These were some of the concrete steps we took, with countless conversations in between. As we move on to the next phase of production, we hope that this documentation will serve as a template for teams that are looking to explore (digital) products — bridging strategic design and product development, and making the move towards transitioning projects into products.</p><p>Lastly, we share some questions that we identified throughout the workshop, which we have ‘parked’ for&nbsp;now.</p>  Do we need everything to be decentralised?  How far does decentralisation go?  What kind of deliberation and decision-making model would the permissioning group adopt? E.g. consensus-based, and what is the reasoning?  How do we help space stewards(permissioning group) shape the rules of the space? What kind of facilitation is&nbsp;needed?  Will financial values be generated by spaces? How do we deal with financial value without encouraging rent-seeking behaviours?

 #1 User journey and scenario building — Day&nbsp;2 <p>This blog is the first in a series documenting the Re:Permissioning the City(PtC) product development journey. In the spirit of “working out loud”, the series aims to share our ongoing progress, learnings, and reflections on building a digital permissioning system designed to unlock underutilised spaces in the city for civic use, through introducing participatory and distributed forms of spatial governance.</p> Day 2: User journey and scenario&nbsp;building <p>On days two and three, we focused on developing the user journeys. The emphasis was placed on creating tangible, realistic use case scenarios which would help us identify the gaps in our concept and challenge where we might be relying too much on theory and assumptions.</p><p>We created a template that divides the system into front stage(frontend) — covering user actions and visible interfaces — and back stage(backend), which handles the behind-the-scenes logic and processes supporting these interactions. We also listed some choices for scenario building, such as types of permissions, users, and&nbsp;spaces.</p>Feel free to adapt our&nbsp;template<p>We decided to prioritise the event organiser and space stewards (space owners, managers, broader stakeholders like neighbours) and split up into two groups, with one group focusing on a scenario around a music event, which deals with pre-defined/automated permissions and an exception approval case, and the other on a food related event that deals with bespoke permissions. We chose music and food specifically as these scenarios are likely to introduce tensions or conflicts. Noise level issues would allow us to explore how we might use sensors to verify and give real-time feedback to space users, preventing the escalation of conflict, and food/cooking would allow us to dig deeper into the liability mechanisms around fire risks, safety and&nbsp;hygiene.</p>Group 1 (left) on food/cooking and Group 2 (right) on&nbsp;music<p>Through the user journey exercise, we were able to clearly distinguish the differences between the three types of permission processes: pre-defined/automated, exception-based, and bespoke permissions.</p><p>Pre-defined/automatic<br>When requesting permissions to use a space, users will be able to choose from an existing template of rules. Template A might be suitable for loud music events with more than 50 people, template B might be suitable for small cooking classes, and template C for book clubs. These templates of rules (or rulebooks) can be initially drafted based on general liability considerations (number of people, types of activity, etc), and further adapted and modified through usage in a particular space. The idea is based on a precedent-based model, similar to case law: if permission has been granted previously for a kind of event without issues, similar future events will also be automatically permitted. For most events that can be classified under certain types of activities, these pre-approved templates will enable instant permissions, simplifying and speeding up the booking&nbsp;process.</p><p>Exception-based<br>Exceptions are cases where users might request small exceptions which need human approval. In one of our scenarios, Pim, who was hosting a religious worship event involving music performance, wanted to request to increase the maximum noise levels allowed. This involves modifying a single clause in one of the template of rules. The request is processed by a ‘permissioning group’ — a group of people who have opted-in to act as a steward of a particular space, who have the responsibility to partake in decision-making as well as maintaining the space. The members of the permissioning group make a consensus based decision, whether to approve or disapprove this exception. They are also made aware that the adapted permission they grant will also become a template for future&nbsp;events.</p><p>Bespoke permissions<br>Bespoke permissions are reserved for rare cases where users are requesting permissions for a completely new type of activity which does not fit into any of the pre-approved templates. In our scenario, this was a proposal for a large local produce market held in a park. A request for bespoke permissions triggers a slightly more complex set of actions than the exception-based permissions. The event organiser will be prompted to construct a new template of rules based on the activity proposed. They will also fill out a self risk assessment form indicating their concerns and what they are excited about (the pros and cons). Submitting this request will trigger a notification to the permissioning group who will be given a due date to arrive at a consensus to approve or reject the new template. Once accepted, the event is permitted, and also future events with the same characteristics can use the template for automatic permission.</p> Principles and&nbsp;values <p>Through the user journey exercise which compelled us to sketch out the details of each action and process, we were also able to define the basic principles of the platform which reflect the underlying logic and values of our concept. They will be used to further define key concepts like the permissioning group, template of rules, feedback systems, incentives and liability mechanisms, and so on. These principles and values can be considered as version 1, which will be iterated later when we have more experience to draw&nbsp;upon.</p><p>Governance</p><p>Power and liability as inextricably linked: If you want to make decisions you need to share liability i.e. skin in the&nbsp;game</p>  Prioritise proximity to space and physical presence (linked to shared risk and liability)  Giving away power is giving away liability (which is why space owners might want to share decision making/permissioning power)  <p>Permissioning based on precedents (like case&nbsp;law)</p>  Every space starts with basic template of rules which are iterated thereafter  Everything is allowed (within legal limits) until something happens to change the&nbsp;rules  Templates need to be updated regularly (time limited templates)  <p>Permissions are peer reviewed (e.g. permissioning group)</p>  Permissioning group performs the role of space stewards — responsible for maintaining permission templates, approving bespoke permissions  Anyone can join a permissioning group  Initial permission group can be formed through a combination of invitations (based on shared liability holders) and self opt-in through shared interests  Deliberations within permissioning group prioritise consensus building — through dialogic processes (rather than majority&nbsp;rule)  Permissioning group participants are given a choice to opt-out of a particular decision  <p>Incentives</p>  Prioritise system level of risk and benefit sharing — to avoid rent seeking behaviours  Prioritise generating system level of incentives/benefits (rather than personal/individual)  <p>Feedback</p>  Based on incentives and positive feedback at the system level rather than penalties and punishment at the individual level  Encourage feedback on rules/permissions not people and their&nbsp;conduct  <p>Technology</p>  We adopt technology not to maximise efficiency and profit, but to enable greater flexibility and freedoms. We acknowledge that technology could be exclusionary, and while we may not be able to address this immediately, we are committed to designing systems that prioritise inclusivity and accessibility. By embracing open standards and decentralisation, we aim to create tools that empower communities rather than control&nbsp;them.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey/59fa3969fc3a">Read Day 1: Transitioning from project to&nbsp;product</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey/1-transitioning-from-project-to-product-day-3-06423aa328b4">Read Day 3: Are we coding too&nbsp;soon?</a></p><p>This blog was written by Eunsoo Lee in conversation with the core team of Permissioning the City and utilising the records of the workshop.</p><p>Team members who contributed to the workshop (in alphabetical order):<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pocalvin/">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donghunohn/">Donghun Ohn</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunjikangsin/">Eunji Kang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tteslee/">Eunsoo Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fang-jui-chang/">Fang-Jui ‘Fang-Raye’ Chang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyojeonglee/">Hyojeong Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuyanglin/">Shuyang Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-campbell/">Theo&nbsp;Campbell</a></p><p>Wider advisory group:<br>Indy Johar, Hee Dae Kim, Gurden Batra, Charlie&nbsp;Fisher</p><p>Partners and funders:<br><a href="https://www.nipa.kr/eng/index">NIPA</a>(National IT Industry Promotion Agency), <a href="https://p4ne.org/">P4NE</a>(Partners for a New Economy), <a href="https://en.parti.coop/">Parti</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey/1-transitioning-from-project-to-product-day-2-866b1a69f4c7">#1 User journey and scenario building — Day 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey">Permissioning the City Product Journey</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 #1 Transitioning from project to product — Day&nbsp;1 <p>This blog is the first in a series documenting the Re:Permissioning the City(PtC) product development journey. In the spirit of “working out loud”, the series aims to share our ongoing progress, learnings, and reflections on building a digital permissioning system designed to unlock underutilised spaces in the city for civic use, through introducing participatory and distributed forms of spatial governance.</p><p>In June 2024, we received good news from one of the many applications we submitted to develop the <a href="https://www.permissioning.city/">Re:Permissioning the City</a> platform. This specific grant awarded by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (<a href="https://www.nipa.kr/">NIPA</a>) of South Korea, allowed us to spend the next 5 months developing the first digital prototype. Having spent the last 3 years developing the concept through small research grants, we were overjoyed to finally have the opportunity to start building something tangible.</p><p>Once we assembled the team, composed of three developers, a graphic designer, and four strategic designers, we gathered in London for a week-long workshop. Looking back, it was an ambitious, high-stakes plan that required turning theory into a concrete product design in a matter of 5 days. We were betting on our combined ‘collective intelligence’ to figure out this challenge together.</p> Day 1: Defining the problem space and scope of our intervention <p>Like any ‘design &amp; innovation’ project, we started by collectively defining and narrowing down our area of intervention. We did this through discussing the problem space, our objectives and value proposition, and through defining the various ‘horizons’ of the product we were setting out to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Problem space</p>  Fairness in allocation of spaces: in the case of Daegu and other public/government-owned spaces, the current process for allocating shared spaces is seen as unfair. For example, a simple first-come-first-served approach often fails to prevent hoarding of use rights (whoever has more resources to submit applications has a higher chance of gaining rights). Seen in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seouls-lgbt-festival-blocked-by-christian-concert-outside-city-hall-organisers-2023-05-04/">case of the public square in front of Seoul City Hall</a> where right-wing Christian groups deliberately submit applications ahead of LGBTQI+ organisations to prevent them from hosting the queer festival, existing rules can be abused to discriminate against certain groups, which challenges fairness and ethics of existing governance models.  Fairness in decision-making: existing governance around spaces are centralised and opaque. Either controlled directly by space owners, or rules set by intermediary organisations entrusted to manage spaces. Ordinary ‘users’ of spaces and other stakeholders (neighbours and others who have a stake) are almost always excluded from the rule-making and permissioning process.  Public value captured in private wealth: we challenge rent-seeking, private ownership models, where 1) public spaces are used to generate private wealth or 2) value generated by the public e.g. rehabilitation through community activities gets captured solely by land/space owners. The focus is on ensuring that public spaces are used in a way that benefits the community rather than being a source of income for private entities.  Decision-making based on individual interests: we advocate for a decentralised commons-based approach to decision-making. The use of spaces in the city is rarely a concern for the property owner alone. Rather, how spaces are used will affect third parties in positive and negative ways, and also the health of the city as a collective whole. This means decisions on how spaces are used should be made collectively, considering the public or commons’ good rather than individual or organisational interests. The idea is to create a system where the use of space benefits the broader community.  Underutilisation of spaces: the current approach to managing public spaces is bureaucratic, which creates barriers to access and results in underutilisation. Even when spaces are managed by single entities (often NGOs and civil society organisations with a specific mandate), it takes a lot of resources to maximise utilisation, costs they often cannot&nbsp;afford.  Barriers to access: it’s not easy for the average citizen to find spaces to do stuff — often, spaces are hard to find (no central database), and then there are restrictions on types of use which can be difficult to navigate.  Rules are restrictive: existing rules around spaces (what you can do and not do) tend to be overly conservative, geared towards preventing potential conflicts. When people want to ask for bespoke permissions (if their activity does not fit into existing types of use), existing booking systems lack processes to easily process these requests, instead reverting to ad-hoc, off-platform negotiation (or outright rejection). We need different kinds of rules and methods of negotiation that can ‘liberate’ spatial use, to accommodate more flexible and creative uses of&nbsp;space.  <p>Hypothesis</p><p>Our hypothesis is that creating a system that enables easier (and democratic) access to public space for communities will remove barriers for people wanting to organise activities that generate social/cultural capital and public value. This will result in increased civic activity in a city (especially key for cities experiencing demographic/economic/social decline), which has broader societal benefits (reduced isolation, better mental health, less division).</p><p>How is what we are building different from conventional booking systems? Why is this way of doing things&nbsp;better?</p>  Democratic: it opens up decision-making/rule-making around shared spaces to a wider range of stakeholders, and by encouraging peer review/approval process, contributes to building democratic capacities.  Legitimacy and consent: peer reviewed permission process allows us to gather people’s consent for activities that might not have been possible before. The net effect is that more events can happen in the city (with legitimacy) because we have a more effective way of revealing and implementing the views of the population.  Mission-driven: allowing space owners and citizens to make social impact easier rather than just maximising profit from rent-seeking activities.  Power distribution and liability sharing: liability and power are interlinked, which means if you have skin in the game, you get to participate in decision-making. The idea is to transition away from ‘externalities’, where negative impacts of an individual’s decisions can be displaced onto the&nbsp;commons.  Open source: we are building an interoperable open source tool that people can fork and integrate into their existing&nbsp;systems.  Distribution of value: financial value derived from a space (e.g. increase of property prices) is often hoarded by land/space owners. We will try to measure non-financial value generated from civic activities, as well as distribute financial value across more stakeholders.  <p>Horizons scoping</p><p>Typically, product teams will create a product roadmap. However, we decided to take a different approach, coming from a strategic design perspective. The key difference between a product roadmap and horizons scoping is that the former is execution focused, while the latter is focused on identifying and assessing different “horizons” or stages of future opportunities, challenges, and strategic goals over a longer period of time. In practice, we adapted elements of both — focusing on describing the hypotheses we wanted to test, while leaving room for uncertainty and more radical imaginations in Horizon 3 as an intended direction of&nbsp;travel.</p><p>Horizon 0 reflects the status quo, Horizon 1 is the scope which is narrowed down considerably to fit the timeline and expectations of the 2024 prototype grant. Horizon 2 reflects what we aim to build as the first full product released to the public, and finally Horizon 3 is a description of where our ambitions lie in the future. What we managed to map out during the workshop is in no way complete — in fact the process of mapping alerted us to critical gaps, such as the question of business models and incentive mechanisms, all of which will need to be defined further. But we share this as a snapshot of our thinking at stage 1 of the development journey.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey/1-transitioning-from-project-to-product-day-2-866b1a69f4c7">Read Day 2: User journey and scenario&nbsp;building</a></p><p>This blog was written by Eunsoo Lee in conversation with the core team of Permissioning the City and utilising the records of the workshop.</p><p>Team members who contributed to the workshop (in alphabetical order):<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pocalvin/">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donghunohn/">Donghun Ohn</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunjikangsin/">Eunji Kang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tteslee/">Eunsoo Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fang-jui-chang/">Fang-Jui ‘Fang-Raye’ Chang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyojeonglee/">Hyojeong Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuyanglin/">Shuyang Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-campbell/">Theo&nbsp;Campbell</a></p><p>Wider advisory group:<br>Indy Johar, Hee Dae Kim, Gurden Batra, Charlie&nbsp;Fisher</p><p>Partners and funders:<br><a href="https://www.nipa.kr/eng/index">NIPA</a>(National IT Industry Promotion Agency), <a href="https://p4ne.org/">P4NE</a>(Partners for a New Economy), <a href="https://en.parti.coop/">Parti</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey/1-transitioning-from-project-to-product-day-1-59fa3969fc3a">#1 Transitioning from project to product — Day 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/permissioning-the-city-product-journey">Permissioning the City Product Journey</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In a world that’s rapidly shifting to digital-first everything, banks like Revolut have redefined how we manage money. Instant transfers, real-time currency exchange, seamless app experiences — all with a sleek interface. But for Jack, a business owner who had £165,000 stolen in under an hour, this digital convenience has become a nightmare. And this story highlights one glaring question: Are centralized financial systems like Revolut’s really equipped to protect us in the digital&nbsp;age?</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6epzxdd77o">Jack’s story is unsettling. It started with a simple phone call from a scammer posing as Revolut.</a> A few security codes later, his entire business account was drained. But this wasn’t just Jack’s mistake. Revolut’s systems failed him. They didn’t flag 137 payments to three new payees in an hour as suspicious, and by the time Jack reached out, he had lost £67,000 more due to the 23-minute delay in freezing his account. Revolut has refused to refund him, and they’re not alone — 10,000 fraud reports last year flagged Revolut as the culprit, more than any major high-street bank.But what if this entire scenario could have been avoided — not with better fraud detection, but by rethinking how we handle identity verification and financial transactions altogether? Enter decentralized identity, the future of Web3 security, powered by solutions like ONT ID from Ontology.</p> The Case for Decentralized Identity <p>Revolut, like most traditional financial systems, uses centralized identity systems to verify who you are. This means your personal information — passwords, codes, biometric data — is stored and managed by a single company. If that system is compromised, as Jack’s was, you’re left exposed, and recovering your losses becomes a bureaucratic nightmare. That’s exactly what happened in Jack’s case. Fraudsters bypassed facial-recognition software and hijacked his account. The fact that Revolut didn’t even have a stored image of the fraudsters who authorized the theft shows the cracks in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Decentralized identity flips this model on its head. With ONT ID, users don’t need to rely on a single institution to prove their identity. Instead, you are in control of your identity, managing it through a decentralized system that uses blockchain technology to verify your credentials securely. This self-sovereign identity model means your personal data is no longer centralized, reducing the risk of massive data breaches or&nbsp;fraud.</p> How ONT ID Could Have Prevented This <p>Imagine if Jack had been using a decentralized identity solution like ONT ID instead of Revolut’s traditional system. Here’s how it could have been different:</p>  No Centralized Control: Jack’s identity wouldn’t have been stored on a vulnerable centralized server, reducing the risk of fraudsters gaining access through phishing attacks or bypassing ID verification software.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs: ONT ID is able to implement a zero-knowledge proofs type system, which means Jack could have verified his identity without exposing any sensitive personal information. The scammers wouldn’t have had enough data to initiate the theft in the first&nbsp;place.  Real-Time Security Checks: ONT ID could have flagged any unusual activity in real time through its decentralized network, potentially freezing Jack’s account the moment fraud was detected — long before 137 payments were processed.   Decentralized Finance Meets Decentralized Identity <p>This isn’t just a problem for Revolut; it’s an issue for any centralized institution dealing with financial transactions. Fraudsters are always evolving, looking for ways to exploit these systems. Web3, with its emphasis on decentralization, offers a more secure future. With decentralized finance platforms on the rise, the integration of decentralized identity solutions like ONT ID becomes&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>Jack’s story is a cautionary tale of how fragile centralized financial systems can be, especially when they’re more focused on growth than security. But the solution is right in front of us: By embracing decentralized identity, we can build a future where individuals like Jack are in control of their own data and financial security. And that future isn’t some distant vision — it’s here, with tools like ONT ID leading the&nbsp;charge.</p><p>Ready to help build a more secure, decentralized future?

<p></p>
<p>At the recent <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/news-releases/dmv-recognizes-companies-for-outstanding-mdl-use-cases-at-first-community-hackathon/">California DMV Hackathon</a>, the Block team, represented by members from Square and TBD, won the Best Privacy &amp; Security Design award for building a prototype of an instant age verification system. This solution utilizes mobile drivers’ licenses (mDLs) to provide secure, privacy-centric transactions for age-restricted purchases with Square’s Point of Sale (POS) system.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll explore the core technical components behind our solution, which centered on using TruAge technology to enable seamless, secure age verification.</p>
 How TruAge QR Code Verification Works<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/ca-dmv-mdl#how-truage-qr-code-verification-works" title="Direct link to How TruAge QR Code Verification Works">​</a> 
<p>At the heart of our prototype is the ability to scan and verify a <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/truage/">TruAge Age Token QR code</a>. These QR codes contain a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs">verifiable credential (VC)</a> that confirms a person’s legal age without exposing unnecessary personal information. Here’s a breakdown of how we approached verifying these credentials in our solution.</p>
 
 
<p>Decoding the QR Code Payload</p>
<p>The first step in the verification process was reading the QR code provided by the customer. TruAge QR codes follow a standard format which encodes the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary/#verifiable-presentation">verifiable presentation (VP)</a> in a compact <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a> format.</p>
<p>Our team implemented a scanner using our open source <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-swift/tree/truage-credentials">web5-swift</a> SDK that reads the QR code and decodes the CBOR-encoded payload. This CBOR format is efficient, allowing the verifiable presentation to be transmitted and processed quickly, minimizing any delays at the point of sale.</p>
 
 
<p>Converting CBOR to JSON</p>
<p>Once we decoded the CBOR data, the next step was to parse it into a JSON-based verifiable presentation using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) Data Model v1.1</a>. This model is critical to ensuring interoperability across different platforms and services, as it standardizes how credentials are represented and exchanged in a decentralized manner.</p>
 
 
<p>Validating the Issuer’s DID</p>
<p>After converting the data into a verifiable format, we needed to validate the digital signature on the credential. We retrieved the issuer’s <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> from the TruAge server, which provided us access to a sandbox environment containing their list of authorized DIDs.</p>
<p>Using DIDs, we were able to validate the cryptographic signature to ensure that the credential was issued by a trusted TruAge provider. This validation step is critical for ensuring that the credential has not been tampered with and is issued by a legitimate authority.</p>
 
 
<p>Credential Content Verification</p>
<p>Once the issuer’s signature was validated, the next step was to check the contents of the verifiable credential itself. In this case, we looked for proof that the individual was over 21 and verified that the credential had not expired.</p>
<p>This lightweight verification process ensures that businesses can quickly and easily confirm a customer’s legal age, while protecting their privacy by not exposing sensitive information like birthdates or addresses.</p>
 
 
 Building the Integration: Web5 and TruAge Libraries<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/ca-dmv-mdl#building-the-integration-web5-and-truage-libraries" title="Direct link to Building the Integration: Web5 and TruAge Libraries">​</a> 
<p>To bring this solution to life, we used a few key technologies:</p>
 
 
<p>iOS: Our team developed the iOS implementation using the web5-swift library, which allowed us to efficiently handle the scanning, decoding, and parsing of the TruAge QR codes on Apple devices. You can explore the code here: <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-swift/tree/truage-credentials">web5-swift TruAge Credentials</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Android: For Android, we modified the TruAge library provided by Digital Bazaar to make it compatible with our solution. This involved adapting the library for seamless integration with our QR code parsing and validation logic. The code for this can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/tbdeng/truage-java-vc-verifier">TruAge Java VC Verifier</a>.</p>
 
 
 Privacy and Security at the Forefront<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/ca-dmv-mdl#privacy-and-security-at-the-forefront" title="Direct link to Privacy and Security at the Forefront">​</a> 
<p>Our approach ensures that personal information is protected at every stage of the transaction. By focusing solely on verifying the specific data point needed (in this case, whether someone is over 21), we avoid collecting or storing any unnecessary information. This is a win for both businesses and consumers, as it minimizes risk while maintaining a smooth user experience.</p>
<p>By integrating this technology into <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale/retail">Square’s Retail POS system</a>, we not only enhanced security but also brought innovative, privacy-preserving solutions to small businesses that need to comply with age verification laws. This prototype has the potential to extend to many other use cases, from secure employee onboarding to identity verification for suppliers and customers.</p>
 What’s Next?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/ca-dmv-mdl#whats-next" title="Direct link to What’s Next?">​</a> 
<p>Participating in the California DMV Hackathon is just the beginning of our efforts to drive adoption of mobile drivers’ licenses and secure age verification solutions. Our work continues in collaboration with the California DMV and other industry partners as part of the <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/news-insights/nccoe-announces-collaborators-mobile-drivers-license-mdl-project-use-case-1">NIST consortium</a>, aimed at standardizing and scaling mDLs across the United States.</p>

<p>Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence/">suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2023</a>. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with 84% of finance organizations hit by a cyberattack going on to experience at least one breach.</p>  
<p>Data breaches don't just affect the institution that's compromised but also affect confidence in the sector as a whole. The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/03/global-cyber-threat-to-financial-systems-maurer.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> has highlighted the significant threat that weak financial services cybersecurity poses to the industry and the world. Potential outcomes range from a loss of confidence in financial services to widespread economic instability.</p> 
<p>That's why global cybersecurity regulations have been ramped up over recent years, as they strengthen the security posture of individual firms and the industry overall. Here we'll look at the most important financial services cybersecurity regulations for 2024 and beyond.</p> 
 New York — NYDFS Part 500  
<p>One of the US's most important pieces of cybersecurity legislation is the New York Department of Financial Services cybersecurity bill, technically known as 23 NYCRR Part 500. Enacted in 2017, the bill affects any firm that operates under the banking, insurance or financial services laws out of New York, which are most financial services firms in the US.</p> 
<p>It requires firms to implement a cybersecurity policy over data governance, access controls and consumer privacy. It also obligates the introduction of more robust security methods, such as the deployment of multi-factor authentication for protecting non-public information, according to the NYDFS MFA requirements.</p> 
<p>In November 2023, it added amendments, requiring firms to:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  implement access and privilege management&nbsp;  
  institute quarterly reporting to the board by the CISO  
  increase the scope of incident reporting to include cybersecurity events such as ransomware&nbsp;  
  administer annual risk assessments&nbsp;  
  conduct annual cybersecurity awareness training that focuses on ransomware and social engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  conduct vulnerability management that includes annual penetration testing&nbsp;  
  
<p>In addition, the new amendment mandates that firms implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access and privileged accounts by November 2024.&nbsp;</p> 
 Upcoming Compliance Requirements&nbsp;  
<p>By May 1, 2025, financial institutions must review access privileges for all users with access to sensitive information. This includes automated scans of information systems to identify vulnerabilities and manual review of systems that are not covered by automated scans.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By November 1, 2025, organizations must develop and maintain a comprehensive asset inventory of their information systems that includes key information tracking (e.g, owner, location, etc), policies for updating the asset inventory, and the procedure for disposing of information. ​</p> 
<p>Pro tip: Consider implementing passwordless, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant MFA</a>, based on FIDO standards, to ensure that only cryptographically verified identities can access sensitive financial systems and prevent phishing attacks. These technologies can help companies improve compliance with stringent and evolving regulatory requirements such as NYDFS Part 500.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=dae06fbd-00af-4edd-bff8-a4548b253843&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 US — Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)  
<p>The GLBA has a specific <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/how-comply-privacy-consumer-financial-information-rule-gramm-leach-bliley-act">Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Rule</a> that directly affects financial services cybersecurity. This concerns non-public personal information (NPI) that a company will collect when informing about or providing a financial product or service. Fines for non-compliance can be up to $100,000 per violation and five years in prison for complicit directors.</p> 
 US — Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  
<p>The original Sarbanes-Oxley Act was instrumental in codifying the disclosures companies must make to current or potential investors, as well as the penalties that are due for breaches (with executives being directly on the line for up to $1 million and ten years in prison).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It has since been updated to include cybersecurity considerations. It now obligates all publicly traded companies in the US and their wholly-owned subsidiaries to declare adherence to cybersecurity best practices in areas such as authentication and data safety. They are also required to report any data breaches publicly.</p> 
<p>Pro tip: Ensure secure employee identity proofing during onboarding by using a combination of background checks, strong authentication that includes secure cryptographic protocols and biometric validation to comply with Know Your Employee (KYE) regulations.</p> 
 US — FFIEC Standards  
<p>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is an interagency body that sets standards for all federally supervised financial institutions, including their subsidiaries. The FFIEC cybersecurity best practices includes guidance on effective authentication and access risk management practices. The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ffiec-endorses-passwordless-mfa">FFIEC authentication standards</a> emphasize multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a critical security control against financial loss and data compromise, similar to the PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication mandate.</p> 
<p>It includes references to NIST standards SP 1800-17 and SP 800-63B, which provide implementation guidelines for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> based on FIDO specifications. In August 2024, the FFIEC announced that it will sunset its Cybersecurity Assessment Tool on August 31, 2025, and asks financial insitutions to refer directly to relevant government resources, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Cybersecurity Performance Goals.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=144955ed-0aee-4519-80f5-8538b0cfd4c0&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 US — FTC Safeguards Rule  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">FTC Safeguards Rule</a> requires non-banking financial institutions, such as mortgage brokers, auto dealers, and payday lenders, to implement a comprehensive security program to keep their customers’ information safe. The FTC Safeguards Rule had several new provisions that went into effect in 2023. Among the new statutes is a mandate for multi-factor authentication for anyone accessing customer information. It should be noted that this includes <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktop and server access</a>, not just applications.</p> 
 US — NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0  
<p>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) was originally designed as a guide for businesses of all industries and sizes to manage cybersecurity risk. The newest version, the CSF 2.0, addresses the evolution of technology towards cloud migration and SaaS by adding the function of governance and a set of searchable resources for security leaders to use to make the best decisions regarding their cybersecurity</p> 
<p>This framework is particularly relevant for financial organizations who rely heavily on SaaS technology and cloud solutions and accounts and have a vast amount of sensitive data and information that they must protect from data breaches, cyberattacks and operational failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pro tip: Implement continuous authentication to validate user identity in real-time, ensuring security throughout the entire session. This type of <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a> defends against risks related to stolen credentials and unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p> 
 US — Executive Order on Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  
<p>Enacted in 2013, the Executive Order on Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity 13636 requires federal agencies to work together with the private sector to strengthen security in critical sectors such as water, electricity and healthcare. During the global coronavirus the financial services sector was officially classified as a critical sector as it was considered essential to maintaining the nation’s economic stability.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations are encouraged to use the NIST CSF framework to align their cybersecurity risk with a strategic plan of defense. This includes information sharing, developing incident response and recovery plans, and strengthening cybersecurity resilience through measures such as MFA and threat detection.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The mandates for 2024 and 2025 include requiring each sector to have a specific cybersecurity plan tailored to their risk and improved intelligence and threat sharing. In addition, it tasks different federal agencies with being responsible for different critical infrastructure (e.g. the Department of Energy is responsible for the security of the U.S’s energy sector). It also requires the federal government to adopt minimum security requirements and a risk-based approach to critical infrastructure.</p> 
<p></p> 
 California — California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  
<p>Introduced to help protect the privacy rights and consumer protections of Californians, the CCPA affects any company which does business with Californians and meets one of the following:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Has a gross revenue of over $25 million  
  Buys, sells or receives personal data on 50,000 consumers  
  Makes over half its revenue from selling consumers' personal information&nbsp;  
  
<p>The fines can be up to $2,500 for unintentional violations and $7,500 for intentional violations, which will be multiplied per record stolen in the case of a data breach.</p> 
 EU — Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2)  
<p>The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/intro-to-psd2-sca-requirements">PSD2 requirement</a> was introduced to make it easier for financial services companies to integrate and securely share data while making payment systems safer. In addition, the law set specific technical standards for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/psd2-sca">strong customer authentication</a> and improving security measures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The measures affect all companies catering to consumers in the EU and any payments that start, travel through or end in the EU. This puts clear obligations on financial services cybersecurity, even for firms outside the EU.</p> 
<p>An updated version of the framework, PSD3, is currently in review. PSD3 will introduce significant changes for banks and non-bank payment service providers (PSPs), as well as consumers. The changes include new Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulations, with stricter rules around data access, payment protection, and authentication of users. The final version is expected to be published late 2024 and be enforceable in 2026.</p> 
 EU — NIS2 Directive  
<p>NIS2, or the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555">Network and Information Security Directive 2</a>, is an updated regulation from the European Union designed to strengthen cybersecurity across multiple industries. It will become law on October 17, 2024. NIS2 expands on the original NIS Directive by widening its scope and imposing stricter rules on security practices and incident reporting, with stiffer penalties for non-compliance.</p> 
<p>Under NIS2, entities in sectors like energy, finance, transport, healthcare and manufacturing must implement strong cybersecurity protocols. These include effective risk management, strong authentication and access protocols, real-time threat monitoring, and rigorous incident reporting standards.</p> 
<p>Importantly, the directive specifies the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and continuous authentication to protect network and information systems (Article 21 2(j)). NIS2 impacts not only major financial institutions, but also smaller financial entities, payment services, and digital wallets.</p>

 EU — Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)&nbsp;  
<p>In response to increasing numbers of cybersecurity attacks and operational disruption after the financial crisis of 2018, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is targeted towards increasing the resilience of the financial sector for businesses in the European Union and those dealing with EU-based customers.</p> 
<p>It includes authentication and access control requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems, which the financial industry in particular is increasingly relying on for the outsourcing of services that deal with sensitive data. DORA is aimed at helping to defend against the unauthorized access of malicious actors to this sensitive data that could lead to data breaches, security incidents, and operational disruptions.</p> 
 EU — General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
<p>All companies processing the data of European Union citizens are affected by the GDPR. The law determines how data is used and protected and governs how consent must be used for collecting it. Along with data usage, timely reporting of breaches is also obliged if it affects EU citizens.</p> 
<p>For financial services cybersecurity, adhering to GDPR is essential. Failure to do so can lead to fines of $20 million or 4% of global revenue, with Amazon receiving the biggest fine so far of $888 million.</p> 
 UK — Data Protection Act  
<p>After the UK left the EU, it kept the GDPR which it passed into law as the Data Protection Act (2018). It is roughly the same as the EU-GDPR (just amended for UK citizens) but still carries the same requirements around data safety, consent and reporting, and fines for non-compliance.</p> 
 Global - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)  
<p>The PCI DSS covers the processors of payments from major credit and debit card companies. To achieve compliance, financial services cybersecurity programs must meet several obligations, such as protecting cardholder data, encrypting data in storage and transmission, and authenticating access to all system components. Breaches of the PCI DSS may result in fines and restrictions in using major credit cards.</p> 
<p>The latest version of <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/pci-dss-4-password-mfa-requirements">PCI DSS 4.0</a> requires strong authentication requirements specifically related to passwords and MFA. Passwords now have stricter specifications(e.g., resetting them every 90 days) and MFA requirements have extended beyond administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE) to all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers and endpoints.</p> 
<p>Pro tip: Ensure compliance with standard 8.3.3 by using automated, high-assurance <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a> methods when resetting user credentials / authentication factors. This standard requires user identity verification before modifying authentication to prevent attacks that target this reset process.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Singapore — Monetary Authority of Singapore Notices on Cyber Hygiene  
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates financial institutions in the banking, capital markets, insurance and payments sectors. The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/cyber-security">MAS has issued </a>a collection of notices on cyber hygiene, which are a set of legally binding requirements that financial institutions must take to mitigate the growing risk of cyberthreats.</p> 
<p>The cyber hygiene notices cover six key areas, which include securing administrative account access, regular vulnerability patching and mitigation controls for systems that cannot be patched, written and regularly tested security standards, perimeter defense systems, malware protection and multi-factor authentication for any system used to access critical information.</p> 
 Other — Various U.S. State Biometric Laws  
<p>Multiple U.S. states have biometric privacy laws — such as the Illinois <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004">Biometric Information Privacy Act</a> (BIPA) — that affect any company doing business with a resident of that state. These laws regulate collection and storage of biometric information, such as face scans, fingerprints, or voiceprints. The statutes point out that biometric identifiers are different from other types of sensitive information as they are biologically unique to the individual, and cannot be changed once compromised.</p> 
 Consequences of Non-Compliance with Financial Cybersecurity Regulations  
<p>When businesses fail to comply with these financial cybersecurity regulations, they are subject to monetary penalties, increased regulatory scrutiny, and a higher risk of cybersecurity incidents. For example, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/unpacking-the-nydfs-mfa-fines">the fines for NYDFS non-compliance</a> can be $250,000 a day for ongoing non-compliance. These penalties and security incidents due to non-compliance also affect customer trust and the value of the brand. In 2022, Uber’s stock went down by 5% after its third data breach in three months.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Along with operational disruption and a loss in revenue, cybersecurity incidents may result in legal action months or even years after the incident, as in the case with the class action suit against <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240630616620/en/MSP-Recovery-Law-Firm-Files-National-Class-Action-on-Behalf-of-Auto-Dealers-and-Consumers-Against-CDK-Global-Over-Data-Breaches-at-More-Than-15000-Auto-Dealerships">CDK consumers from the MOVEit data breach</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
 Achieve Regulatory Compliance with Identity Assurance  
<p>The financial services sector is at high risk of cyberattacks due to the value of successful data breaches or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a>. To combat this, state, national and supranational governments and industry groups have introduced several financial services cybersecurity regulations to ensure best practice is deployed throughout the industry.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common thread throughout much of the financial services cybersecurity regulations worldwide is the protection of data and stronger identity security systems. Financial services organizations globally, including two of the top four banks, rely on HYPR&nbsp; to secure their systems and achieve regulatory compliance.</p> 
<p>HYPR combines FIDO2 passwordless MFA, continuous adaptive risk response and automated identity verification to secure finance organizations while improving user experience.

<p>This is the third article in a series of technical posts about how Track &amp; Trust works at a component level. The world today is full of fake news and dubious “facts.” Consequently, we face a significant challenge in verifying the accuracy of the data we receive. Moreover, a major part of this challenge is identifying the source of this data. We can’t predict who the end users of the Track &amp; Trust system will be or exactly what they will want to communicate, which makes this task even more difficult. To address this issue, we must ensure that data entering our system are valid. This post explores how the “Trust” part of Track &amp; Trust works. It explains exactly how we maintain the chain of data authenticity. </p>
<p>Quick navigation links to the follow-up articles will be provided at the bottom of each article once the series is complete. For now, let’s jump in.</p>
 Establishing a foundation for the data authenticity chain 
<p>We designed our system to accommodate key requirements that establish a foundation for data authenticity. Specifically, our goal was to create a flexible system. This system can work with any logistics company, regardless of their internal processes. Notably, we achieved this flexibility, which is a key benefit of Track and Trust. This allows us to collaborate with a wide range of partners. Furthermore, logistics companies can increase the number of data points they receive about their shipments from the field by using Track &amp; Trust.</p>
<p>This, in turn, enables them to achieve <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>. Our team structured the Track &amp; Trust data to integrate easily into any logistics database. In particular, we use a series of linked cryptographic signatures and blockchain transactions to create this data authenticity chain. Finally, this chain of custody has a specific purpose. It ensures that we can authenticate and validate offline events once they reach our servers.</p>
 How does the data authenticity chain work? 
<p>TLDR: We leverage APIs to take inputs from our customers (Logistics Firms) as well as to give them valuable probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking data back. For demonstration purposes we have built a <a href="https://track-and-trust.dev.opsmobix.net/home">front-end website</a> to make the system tangible but the magic happens via our <a href="https://track-and-trust.dev.opsmobix.net/api/docs#/">swagger API</a>.</p>
<p>The processes surrounding our data authenticity chain are pretty technical. To make it easier to understand we’ve formated the workflow into a sequence diagram that anyone can understand.</p>
  
<p>In summary, our data authenticity chain is simply a way of validating, recording and making messy data from the field trustworthy. Once that’s accomplished leverage our blockchain toolkit to make those data immutable and highly tamper resistant. It’s a chain of custody for that data that includes built-in proof of origin. This, in turn, enables traceability and trust beyond the current state of the art.</p>
<p>Our next post will cover all of the ways that we can view this information. We’ll also be covering the orchestration systems operating in the background that enable us to do over the air updates to the hardware.&nbsp; There will be dashboards, monitoring and CI/CD galore for your perusal.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>In today’s hyper-connected world, cybersecurity professionals protect organizations from increasingly complex threats. While essential for safeguarding data and digital infrastructures, this work often takes a mental toll. Pressures arise from regulatory demands, business expectations, law enforcement interactions, cybercriminals, and IT complexity.</p>
<p>Regulatory Pressures and Compliance</p>
<p>Compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS requires constant monitoring and attention to detail. The consequences of non-compliance heighten anxiety for professionals responsible for ensuring strict adherence.</p>
<p>Business Demands and Pace of Work</p>
<p>Cybersecurity teams face constant pressure as businesses drive digital transformation. Balancing business goals with preventing vulnerabilities leads to exhaustion. The demand to "do more with less" and justify security investments adds stress, especially when prevention's value is hard to quantify.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement and Criminal Activity</p>
<p>Collaborating with law enforcement and combating cybercriminals, including organized crime and state actors, brings additional stress. Investigating breaches and countering these threats can take a psychological toll.</p>
<p>Technological Complexity and Uncertainty</p>
<p>The fast-evolving tech landscape requires continuous learning. The unpredictability of threats and managing complex systems lead to burnout and self-doubt, increasing pressure to stay ahead of attackers.</p>
<p>Day-to-Day Cybersecurity Operations</p>
<p>Cybersecurity professionals also manage daily tasks like network monitoring and incident response. The constant vigilance and high task volume often lead to cognitive overload, disrupting work-life balance and causing fatigue.</p>
<p>A Call to Address Mental Health</p>
<p>The mental health challenges facing cybersecurity professionals are significant. Organizations must address these challenges and provide support. This important issue will be discussed at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">Cyberevolution 2024</a> conference in Frankfurt, Germany, from 3–5 December.</p>
<p>Addressing mental health is key to fostering a resilient workforce. Recognizing this helps protect both digital infrastructures and the professionals who defend them. Providing realistic workloads, work-life balance, and destigmatizing mental health is essential for a sustainable workforce.</p>
<p>At cyberevolution 2024, speakers on this topic include <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/speakers/2866">Sarb Sembhi</a>, CTO at Virtually Informed; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/speakers/3606">Jasmine Eskenzi</a>, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of The Zensory; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/speakers/3673">Inge van der Beijl</a>, Director Innovation at Northwave Investigation and Innovation; and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5756/2">Hermann Huber</a>, CISO at Hubert Burda Media.</p>

<p>One of the biggest pieces of news of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election has been the July 20th announcement by President Joe Biden, made via a letter that many saw first on social media, that he was withdrawing from the race. The immediate reaction was skepticism and disbelief – an understandable reaction in an era when it seems like more and more of what we see on the internet is fake, false, or misleading.&nbsp;</p><p>The fallout of this skepticism was luckily limited. However, misinformation can have major impacts on people’s behavior, and the broader mistrust it sows can be deeply toxic for an entire society. Current attempts to deal with the problem, such as by fact-checking organizations, can’t keep up, especially as generative AI makes fakes much easier to produce.</p><p>It’s time for a different way to authenticate content online, and luckily, there’s one not too far over the horizon: digital signatures based on privacy-preserving cryptography can be used to prove the real source of online content. States,<a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/california-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> including California</a>, are testing out a state-issued digital ID, known as the mobile driver’s license (mDL), based on these digital signatures.&nbsp;</p><p>Particularly for important announcements from trusted sources, trustworthy digital signatures could have a huge positive impact on the information environment, and ultimately could help rebuild the trust that has been eroded by the online free-for-all of the past decade.</p><p>Let’s explore how that could work.</p> The Death of Drawn Signatures <p>President Biden’s withdrawal announcement was made, not in a network-televised speech, but via a letter on Biden’s letterhead. The letter was distributed to news outlets but also posted to social networks, including X (formerly known as Twitter), where many commentators saw it first. This cut out key sources of trust and vetting: the authenticity of a direct spoken statement and the third-party confirmation of a news organization.</p><p>It’s little surprise, then, when some speculated that Biden’s letter might not be real. After all, Twitter accounts can be hacked, and anyone might have created the letter. Notably, skeptics cast doubt specifically on<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13659329/joe-biden-sign-resignation-letter-theory-internet.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Biden’s signature</a> – the very tool humans have used to prove the authenticity of communications for centuries, even millennia.&nbsp;</p><p>Those doubts left a gap for<a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.364R2N9?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> a fake video</a> of Biden purportedly making the announcement. That’s just one example of the fake videos, audio, and photos we’re likely to see in the coming weeks and months, as partisans engage in boundary-breaking informational warfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Disinformation has always been one of the dark arts of politics, but new generative AI tools make such fakery so easy that fact-checkers can never hope to keep up. In fact, AI and automation are also empowering “bots” on social media and across the internet, which can simulate real humans’ reactions to content, misleading some victims even more severely with false “social proof.” In one worrying recent example,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/09/g-s1-9010/russia-bot-farm-ai-disinformation?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Russian operatives have used AI to impersonate Americans</a> supposedly opposed to military support for Ukraine.</p><p>With the internet increasingly the center of political discussion in America and around the world, and with the most powerful politicians in the world making major announcements via social media, we need a better way to separate the fake from the real.</p> The Unfakeable Proof of Digital Signatures <p>To understand how content could be reliably associated with a real-world identity, we have to touch on a somewhat difficult topic: cryptography.</p><p>The problem with verifying content online up to now is that the infrastructure of the internet has no built-in identity system, and any digital file can be copied. That’s why digital information systems “break” traditional forms of attestation – anyone can post any file, from any location, and claim to be anyone. Not only can you copy-paste a written signature onto any document, you can now fairly effectively fake video of someone making a statement. While dedicated digital sleuths can spot impostors in various ways, it’s very difficult for amateurs.</p><p>Reliably “signing” a digital message instead relies on encryption techniques that aren’t exactly new but are still unfamiliar—digital signatures and public-key cryptography.&nbsp;</p><p>In very broad terms, online public information could be reliably signed using a digital certificate issued and affirmed by a known source – possibly a driver’s license issuer, but not exclusively, as we’ll see. That certificate would then be mathematically mixed with the digitized message content, or “hashed,” to produce a string of characters that can only be matched back to that specific content-signature pair.&nbsp;</p><p>That hash file would be attached to a public post, and anyone who wanted to affirm its authenticity could check that this specific content was signed by a specific person’s certification. To draw a rather abstract metaphor, it’s like signing a document with ink that contains all the letters in the document itself – a signature unique to one piece of data.</p><p>This leaves out a lot of technical detail, but what matters is that this system can’t be spoofed or broken, except by extraordinary measures, such as physically stealing certificate-signing hardware from the DMV. In the case of our election example, the President could certify, using his mobile driver’s license or other verifiable digital ID, the content in his social media statement using a digital signature and the public would be able to trust it’s authenticity.</p><p>This type of digital signature has another advantage – you don’t actually have to reveal your identity to sign content. Digital ID systems, such as mobile driver’s licenses, have what are known as ‘selective disclosure’ features, meaning you can attest only to the specific information you want. That can include simply affirming that “a human produced this content,” without disclosing your name. Or you can show that it was made by “a human from Dallas,” without disclosing your address.&nbsp;</p><p>This is important to emphasize because the idea of a digital identity can initially sound oppressive or authoritarian – and it certainly can be, if implemented using authoritarian ideals. But under the right regulatory and technology framework, they can be far more privacy-preserving than current models.</p><p>Most importantly, and in sharp contrast with the most dystopian fears, you won’t even have to depend on a government agency to attest to your identity.</p><p>This is a widely-shared vision of the digital identity future, one that aligns with the values of privacy, individual freedom, and democratic choice. At the same time, it offers a vast improvement in online trust over the current status quo.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Americans and many others will see yet again just how flawed our online discourse is. Being able to prove who’s talking, whether President or pauper, is an obvious starting point for fixing it.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

  <p>Embarking on a DevOps journey can be exciting and daunting, especially for beginners. The landscape is vast, and the learning curve can feel steep. One of the most common challenges is setting up and managing a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that ensures seamless integration and delivery of code changes. This guide aims to simplify that process by walking you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline for Okta using Terraform, AWS, and GitHub Actions.</p>

 Overcoming DevOps challenges securely 

<p>Getting started with DevOps often presents a series of challenges:</p>
 
   Running Locally: Setting up Terraform locally involves dealing with packages, dependencies, and managing the state file, which can be cumbersome and error-prone. 
   Collaboration: Ensuring team members can collaborate effectively requires a consistent and reproducible environment. 
 

<p>Making a setup production-ready introduces further complexities:</p>

 
   State File Storage: Knowing where and how to store the Terraform state file securely. 
   Secrets Management: Safely storing and managing sensitive information like API keys and passwords. 
   Automation: Automating the deployment process to ensure reliability and efficiency. 
 

<p>In this post, we’ll use Okta, Terraform, AWS, GitHub, and GitHub actions to create a secure CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<p>By the end of this post, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to set up a CI/CD pipeline tailored for Okta and the knowledge to start implementing infrastructure as code with Terraform.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in and take the first step towards mastering DevOps with a practical, hands-on approach!</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>You’ll need the following tools installed on your local machine. Follow the installation instructions through the provided links.</p>
 
   IDE with a Terraform plugin, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Choosing the proper Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a Terraform plugin is crucial for an efficient and error-free workflow. Some essential features to look for in your IDE:</p>

       
         Variable Declaration Warnings: If your Terraform module requires certain variables, the IDE will alert you when any required variables are not declared. 
         Resource Declaration Assistance: When you declare a resource, the IDE will warn you if any required attributes are missing and suggest attributes to add. 
         Resource and Attribute Autocompletion: The IDE will autocomplete resource names and attributes when referencing other resources, saving time and reducing errors. 
       
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> 
   Terminal window 
 

<p>You’ll need the following accounts:</p>
 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Workforce Identity Cloud Developer Edition account</a> 
   <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a> and a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch">GitHub organization account</a> (You can create a free GitHub organization if you don’t have access to one) 
   A free <a href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register">AWS account</a> 
 

 CI/CD pipeline architecture using Terraform, AWS, Okta, and GitHub 

<p>It is essential to understand the key components and their roles in the CI/CD process. This integration of GitHub, Terraform, AWS, and Okta allows for secure and efficient infrastructure management and deployment. The following overview details each component and its function.</p>

<p></p>

<p>User</p>
 
   Develop Code: Develops Terraform code on their local machine using a preferred IDE. Uses Git to push code to the GitHub repository. 
 

<p>GitHub Repository</p>
 
   Code Storage: Stores the Terraform configuration code. 
   Triggers Workflow: GitHub Actions checks out code that automates builds using Terraform based on events within the GitHub repository (e.g., push to branches, pull requests, etc.). 
 

<p>GitHub Actions</p>
 
   Workflows: Workflows are automatically triggered by GitHub repository events and execute the necessary commands to integrate with AWS and Terraform. 
   AWS:
     
       Assume Role: Integrates with AWS IAM STS via GitHub OIDC IdP to authenticate and assume roles with web identity. 
       Temporary Credentials: Utilizes temporary credentials returned from AWS IAM STS for Terraform backend operations. 
     
   
   Terraform: Runs Terraform commands to manage infrastructure. 
 

<p>Terraform</p>
 
   State Management:
     
       S3: Utilizes S3 for storing Terraform state files. 
       DynamoDB: Uses DynamoDB for state locking to ensure consistency and prevent concurrent operations. 
       Secrets Management: Retrieves Okta OAuth2 client credentials private key from AWS Secrets Manager for authentication and authorization to Okta management APIs. 
     
   
   Okta:
     
       Resource Management: Leverages Okta APIs via the Terraform Okta provider to manage resources. 
     
   
 

 CI/CD workflow overview 

<p>At a high level, this is what we aim to build out through this article. We’ll set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates infrastructure deployment using GitHub, Terraform, AWS, and Okta. Here’s a simplified overview of the workflow:</p>

<p></p>

 
   Branch Creation: Developers create and work on a <code>develop</code> branch. 
   Push to Develop: Code changes are committed locally and pushed to the remote <code>develop</code> branch. 
   Dev Build: GitHub Actions run Terraform commands to deploy to the development environment. The push to develop automatically triggers this. 
   Pull Request to Main: A pull request is made from <code>develop</code> to <code>main</code> for code review. Any GitHub Action workflow executions are included in the pull request for review. 
   Prod Plan: GitHub Actions preview changes for the production environment. This is triggered automatically by the pull request to main, and it lets pull request reviewers validate potential changes before modifying the production environment. 
   Merge to Main: The pull request is approved and merged into the <code>main</code> branch. 
   Prod Build: GitHub Actions runs Terraform commands to deploy to the production environment. The merge to <code>main</code> automatically triggers this. 
 

 Store Terraform files in source control 

<p>We’ll use GitHub as our code repository and GitHub Actions for our CI/CD workflows, so you’ll need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one, create one at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You will also need a GitHub Organization. If you are an enterprise user, you likely already have one. If not, or if you’re experimenting, you can create one for free by following the <a href="https://github.com/settings/organizations">GitHub Organizations</a> instructions to start creating an Organization.</p>

<p>You’ll create a new repository within your GitHub Organization and then connect it to your local development environment:</p>

 
   Create a new repository: We created a templated repository for you to use for this guide. Follow the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template">Creating a repository from a template</a> instruction from GitHub and use this <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-terraform-devops-template-example">sample template</a>.  Select your GitHub Organization as the owner and name the repository using a structure such as <code>{okta-domain-name}-okta-terraform</code> (e.g., <code>atko-okta-terraform</code>). Ensure you set the repository to Private. This setting is crucial as the repository will run GitHub Actions workflows and have information related to your environment (e.g., AWS resource names). 
   Clone the Repository: Once you create your repository, copy the clone link and run the following commands in the command line. Replace the variables with your GitHub username, GitHub organization, and repository name:
       <code>git clone https://{your_github_username}@github.com/{your-github-organization}/{your-repository-name}.git
cd {your-repository-name}
</code>       
   
 

 Connect to Okta securely using OAuth 2.0 

<p>We will use the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to access Okta APIs. OAuth 2.0 is the most secure method for integrating with Okta APIs, as we can tightly bound authorizations using scopes, and access tokens are short-lived compared to the long-lived <code>SSWS</code> API keys. Furthermore, Okta’s Terraform provider supports <a>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP)</a>, which is an additional security mechanism to bind access tokens to a particular client through cryptography, thereby reducing the risk of token replay by a malicious actor.</p>

<p>The Okta OAuth client requires ‘scopes’ to interact with the management API. For this guide, we will interact with the Groups resource in Terraform and corresponding APIs. To understand the corresponding scopes related to a Terraform resource and underlying Management APIs, refer to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/">Okta API documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the OAuth client requires an Administrator Role to make administrative changes. We will assign the Organization Administrator role as this contains sufficient permissions for the resources we manage within this build. If you intend to use Terraform to manage your environment ongoing, a  Super Administrator may be required (especially for managing resources like Admin Roles). The effective permissions are a combination of the scopes permitted for the client and the Administrator Role - so even though we provide the client ‘Organization Administrator,’ if we only give access to ‘groups’ related scopes, all the client can do via the API is manage groups!</p>

<p>Follow these steps to set up an API Services application in Okta. Navigate to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta Admin Console</a> and follow the steps to create the API services application:</p>
 
   Navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and press the button to Create App Integration 
   Select API Services and press Next 
   Name your application (e.g., Terraform) 
   Press Save 
 

<p>In the General Settings tab, find the Client Credentials section and press Edit to make the following changes:</p>
 
   Change the Client authentication method to Public key / Private key. 
   In the Public Keys section, click Add key and then Generate new key. 
   Select the PEM tab and copy the contents to a file you’ll use later. 
   Select Done and Save 
 

<p>Navigate to Okta API Scopes tab and make the changes:</p>
 
   Find <code>okta.groups.manage</code> and select Grant 
 

<p>Navigate to the Admin roles tab and press Edit assignments. Then apply the following changes:</p>
 
   In the Role drop-down, select ‘Organization Administrator’, or your preferred Admin Role 
   Select Save Changes to finish assigning the role 
 

<p>Repeat these steps to create an API Service Okta application and configure it for any additional environments you manage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Important</p>

  <p>Do not save the private key locally. In the next steps, we will securely onboard it to secrets management.</p>
</blockquote>

 Leveraging AWS for Terraform Backend and Secrets Management 

<p>We will utilize AWS for both the Terraform backend and Secrets Management. The Terraform backend will store state files, which track the status of your Okta environment based on previous builds. We will use the GitHub OIDC integration with AWS for Terraform authentication. This allows GitHub to authenticate with AWS using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and assume the necessary role via web identity to interact with required services. This approach eliminates the need for long-lived or persistent secrets (such as AWS access keys and secrets), ensuring a more secure setup.</p>

 Store Terraform backend components in AWS 

<p>First, let’s create the necessary components for the Terraform backend.</p>

<p>Create an S3 Bucket</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html">Creating a bucket</a> instructions from AWS to create a bucket. Name the bucket using a structure such as <code>{okta-domain-name}-okta-terraform-state</code>. By default, Block all public access is enabled, which ensures that your bucket contents are private, which is an integral control given that the bucket will contain information about your Okta configuration. I highly recommend enabling Bucket Versioning to version your state files. This is a valuable feature should you need to roll back to previous versions of the state. After you have created the bucket, follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/view-bucket-properties.html">Viewing the properties for an S3 bucket</a> instructions to navigate to the properties of the bucket and capture the ARN. The ARN will be used later to define the AWS IAM Role Policy. Lastly, we will use folders to organize your different environments’ state files. Follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-folders.html">Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console by using folders</a> instructions to create a folder for each environment you manage (e.g. dev and prod).</p>

<p>Create a DynamoDB Table for State Locking</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-step-1.html">Create a table in DynamoDB</a> instructions to create a DynamoDB table. Name the table using a structure such as <code>{okta-domain-name}-okta-terraform-{environment}</code> (e.g. <code>atko-okta-terraform-dev</code>). Set the partition key to ‘LockID’ and leave other configuration defaults. Note the table name, we will be using it later in the AWS IAM Role Policy definition. Repeat for any other environments you manage.</p>

<p>For more information on the AWS S3 Terraform backend, please refer to <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3">Terraform S3 Backend Documentation</a>.</p>

 Manage secrets securely 

<p>Next, we will set up AWS Secrets Manager to securely store the private key for authentication and authorization to Okta management APIs.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html">Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret</a> instructions to store the OAuth 2.0 private key(s). When configuring the secret, note this is of the secret type Other type of secret, and Plaintext. Ensure you name the secret something meaningful, as this will be referenced in your Terraform configurations, as well as AWS IAM Role Policy definition - follow a structure such as <code>{environment}/okta-terraform-key</code> (e.g., <code>dev/okta-terraform-key</code>). Since it’s a private key, keep any rotation-related configurations as default options. Once the secret has been created, copy the ARN for later use within the AWS IAM Role Policy definition. Repeat for any additional environments you manage.</p>

 Set up the IAM policy for the CI/CD pipeline 

<p>Next, we’ll create the IAM Policy definition. This policy will be used by the role that GitHub will assume via OpenID Connect (OIDC).</p>

<p>First, we will prepare the IAM policy JSON file. 
Use the following template and make the necessary replacements using the ARNs you’ve captured from the previous steps.</p>
 
   Replace <code>&lt;S3-ARN&gt;</code> with the ARN of your S3 bucket. This grants permission to list the bucket. You can find it under the Properties tab of the S3 Bucket. Example: <code>arn:aws:s3:::akto-okta-terraform</code> 
   Replace <code>&lt;S3-ARN&gt;/*</code> with the ARN of your S3 bucket and any folder structures for respective environments. This grants permission to get and update objects in the relevant path. Alternatively, you can use a wildcard (<code>*</code>) for the entire bucket. Example: <code>arn:aws:s3:::akto-okta-terraform/dev/*</code> 
   Replace <code>&lt;AWS-Region&gt;</code>,  <code>&lt;Account-Number&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;DynamoDB-Table-Name&gt;</code> with the AWS Region, AWS Account Number (found in the management console toolbar) and DynamoDB Table Name respectively. This grants permission to add and remove rows in the table for the Terraform state file locking process. Include any additional tables for each environment.
  <code>Example: arn:aws:dynamodb:ap-southeast-2:99123456789:table/akto-okta-terraform-dev</code> 
   Replace <code>&lt;SecretsManager-ARN&gt;</code> with the ARN of your Secrets Manager secret. This grants permission to retrieve the secret value. Include any additional ARNs for each environment.
  Example: <code>arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-southeast-2:99123456789:secret:dev/akto_okta_terraform_key-QuqiGR</code> 
 

   <code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "&lt;S3-ARN&gt;"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "&lt;S3-ARN&gt;/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:&lt;AWS-Region&gt;:&lt;Account-Number&gt;:table/&lt;DynamoDB-Table-Name&gt;"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "&lt;SecretsManager-ARN&gt;"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</code>   

<p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html">Create IAM policies</a> documentation for instructions on creating an IAM Policy. When creating the policy document, use the JSON editor and input the JSON from the previous step. Name the policy something meaningful (e.g. ‘Okta_Terraform_Backend’).</p>

<p>By following these steps, you will have created an IAM policy that provides the necessary permissions for Terraform to interact securely with AWS services.</p>

 Configure an OpenID Connect Provider in GitHub 

<p>Next, we’ll configure the OIDC Identity Provider for GitHub. Follow the AWS instructions at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html#manage-oidc-provider-console">Create an OpenID Connect identity provider in IAM</a>.</p>

 
   For the Provider URL, use <code>https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com</code> 
   For the Audience, use <code>sts.amazonaws.com</code> 
 

<p>For more information on integrating GitHub with AWS using OIDC, refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services">GitHub and AWS integration documentation</a>.</p>

 Create IAM roles for the CI/CD pipeline 

<p>Finally, we’ll create an IAM Role for the GitHub OIDC Identity Provider to assume. This role will link the OIDC Identity Provider via the trusted entity and the policy via permissions.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create">Creating a role for OIDC</a> from AWS. 
When configuring the Trusted Entity, choose Web Identity, and use the following values for the configurations:</p>
 
   Identity provider: <code>token.actions.githubusercontent.com</code> 
   Audience: <code>sts.amazonaws.com</code> 
   GitHub organization: <code>{your_github_organization}</code> (the unique identifier for your GitHub Organization) 
   GitHub repository: <code>{your_github_repository}</code> (the name of your GitHub repository) 
 

<p>For permissions, choose the IAM Policy (‘Okta_Terraform_Backend’, or your name of choosing) you created earlier. Name the role something meaningful (e.g. ‘GitHub_Okta_Terraform_Backend’). Once the role has been created, copy the Role ARN. This is the only variable we need to pass to our pipeline to initialize the backend and retrieve the secret to authenticate and authorize Okta APIs — and it’s not even a secret!</p>

<p>By following these steps, you will have created an IAM Role that GitHub can assume via OIDC, enabling secure interactions with AWS and Okta.</p>

 Use GitHub Actions to trigger Terraform commands 

<p>GitHub Actions allows us to run our build and deployment activities using Terraform commands executed in a temporary virtual machine.</p>

<p>First, we must store the Role ARN and other environment variables in GitHub. To create and store variables for the GitHub repository, follow the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository">Creating configuration variables for a repository</a> instructions.</p>

 
   Store the Role ARN: Create a variable named AWS_ROLE_ARN and use the Role ARN for the value (e.g. <code>arn:aws:iam::&lt;Account-Number&gt;:role/&lt;Role-Name&gt;</code>). 
   Store the Region: Create a variable named AWS_REGION and use the Region in which the AWS resources were created (e.g. <code>ap-southeast-2</code>). Refer to the following documentation for more details on Region names: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html">AWS Regions Documentation</a> 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>Ensure you do this at a ‘Repository’ level and not at an ‘Organization’ level, or the GitHub Actions workflows will not be able to read the variables</p>
</blockquote>

 Leverage GitHub Actions for the CI/CD workflow 

<p>We will use multiple pre-built GitHub Actions to authenticate to AWS and run our Terraform commands. No action is required from you to configure these workflows. At a high level, the configured GitHub Actions workflows will perform the following:</p>

 
   GitHub Actions Runner: This action checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing you to run Terraform commands against your code. 
   AWS Configure AWS Credentials: This action establishes an AWS session using the GitHub OIDC Identity Provider (IdP) and the Assume Role with Web Identity capability. There is no need to manage any secrets or custom scripts, as this action will handle session establishment. 
   Terraform CLI: This action runs the Terraform commands. 
 

<p>For more information and to examine the code, see the <code>github/workflows</code> folder within the repository.</p>

 Organize the CI/CD and Terraform code files for maintainability 

<p>The high-level structure of the repository looks like this:</p>

 <code>github/
├─ workflows/
│  ├─ push-main.yml
│  ├─ push-develop.yml
│  ├─ pr-main.yml
terraform/
├─ modules/
│  ├─ {module}/
│  │  ├─ {resource}.tf
│  │  ├─ variables.tf
├─ main.tf
├─ variables.tf
├─ backend-dev.conf
├─ backend-prod.conf
├─ vars-dev.tfvars
├─ vars-prod.tfvars
</code> 

 Review the GitHub Workflows directory 

 
   github/workflows/: This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow files that define the CI/CD pipeline.
     
       push-main.yml: Workflow triggered by a push to the main branch. 
       push-develop.yml: Workflow triggered by a push to the develop branch. 
       pr-main.yml: Workflow triggered by a pull request to the main branch. 
     
   
 

 Review the Terraform configuration files 

 
   terraform/: The root directory for all Terraform configuration files.
     
       modules/: This directory contains reusable Terraform modules.
         
           {module}/: Each module has its own directory.
             
               {resource}.tf: The Terraform configuration file for specific resources within the module. 
               variables.tf: The child module input variables definition file 
             
           
         
       
       main.tf: The main Terraform configuration file where all providers, modules, and variables are configured. 
       variables.tf: The parent module input variables definition file. 
       backend-dev.conf: Configuration for the backend components for the development environment. This configuration must be passed in via CLI since named variables cannot be used directly in the backend block. 
       backend-prod.conf: This is the configuration for the backend components in the production environment, similar to the development configuration. 
       vars-dev.tfvars: Input variable values specific to the development environment. 
       vars-prod.tfvars: Input variable values specific to the production environment. 
     
   
 

 Build the CI/CD pipeline using Terraform and Okta 

<p>Now that we have everything set up, let’s actually build something!</p>

<p>First, we will need to update a few files with some of the necessary configurations relevant to your environment. Then we will create a new group in your Okta environment, using variables to declare the group name.</p>

 Set up source control branches for Terraform code files 

<p>Ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the remote main branch.</p>

   <code>git checkout main
git pull origin main
</code>   

<p>Create and switch to the branch named develop.</p>

   <code>git checkout -b develop
</code>   

 Finalize Terraform configuration 

<p>Now that we have checked out our code let’s finalize the configurations required for Terraform to interact with our backend, retrieve the necessary secrets, and interact with the Okta Management APIs. Open the repository in your preferred IDE to edit some files.</p>

 Backend configuration files 

<p>The Terraform backend configuration is stored within the <code>backend-*.conf</code> files and contain configurations relevant to your environments. Within these files, you will find placeholders for the following:</p>
 
   <code>bucket</code> - the name of your bucket (not the ARN!) 
   <code>key</code> - the path to your Terraform state file (i.e. the folder and resultant file name, which defaults to <code>terraform.tfstate</code>) 
   <code>dynamodb_table</code> - the name of your DynamoDB table (not the ARN!) 
   <code>region</code> - the AWS Region 
 

<p>Replace all the placeholders in the <code>backend-*.conf</code> files. There are two placeholders for development and production environments, respectively. Refer to the following example as a reference:</p>

   <code>bucket         = "atko-okta-terraform"
key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
dynamodb_table = "atko-okta-terraform-dev"
region         = "ap-southeast-2"
</code>   

 Terraform variables (tfvars) 

<p>Variables are a critical component within the infrastructure as code configurations allow you to have a single set of configurations while maintaining environment-specific values. Within Terraform, one way to manage such environment-specific values is using ‘tfvars’ files. The ‘tfvars’ file contains a set of variable values specific to an environment. It is passed in via the Terraform CLI in our GitHub Actions workflow when running specific parts of the workflow.</p>

<p>Additional configuration-related variables stored within the <code>vars-*.tfvars</code> files require updates. Within these files, you’ll find placeholders for the following:</p>
 
   <code>region</code> - the AWS Region 
   <code>okta_org_name</code> - the prefix value for your Okta tenant 
   <code>okta_base_url</code> - the base or suffix value for your Okta tenant 
   <code>okta_scopes</code> - the scopes for the Terraform Okta OAuth 2.0 client application 
   <code>okta_client_id</code> - the client ID for the Terraform Okta OAuth 2.0 client application 
   <code>okta_private_key_id</code> - the private key ID for the Terraform Okta OAuth 2.0 client application. This is the ‘KID’ value, which can be obtained in the ‘Public Keys’ section of the OAuth 2.0 application configuration 
   <code>okta_secret_id</code> - the AWS Secrets Manager ‘secret name’ for the private key of the Terraform Okta OAuth 2.0 client application. This is the ‘Secret name’ value, not the ‘Secret ARN’. 
 

<p>Replace all the placeholders in the <code>vars-*.tfvars</code> files. Refer to the following example as a reference:</p>
   <code>region            = "ap-southeast-2"
okta_org_name     = "atko"
okta_base_url     = "oktapreview.com"
okta_scopes       = [
  "okta.groups.manage"
]
okta_client_id    = "0oaes123y1FekjfoE1d7"
okta_private_key_id = "ievOgRgNc...aJJn5ra_4"
okta_secret_id    = "dev/okta_terraform_key"
</code>   

 Connect Terraform code to Okta resources 

<p>The repository includes a directory module containing a resource okta_groups.tf, which we will use to provide a group for your Okta tenant. In doing so, we’ll also go through a core tenet of the previously mentioned variables, where we will define both input and output variables. This may be a little confusing initially, so take some time to understand how the different files and modules interact! The following diagram may help contextualize the various files we are going to step through:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open <code>terraform/modules/directory/variables.tf</code> and uncomment the following entry. This is the variables file for the directory module and it defines which input variables are required. Each module you develop will have its own variables file.</p>

   <code>variable "okta_group_name" {
  type = string
}
</code>   

<p>Open <code>terraform/modules/directory/okta_groups.tf</code> and uncomment the following entry. This is a resource block. The resource block has two parts: firstly, the resource type, <code>okta_group</code> , and the resource name, <code>okta_test_group</code>. Feel free to change the resource block name (okta_test_group) to something you choose. Within the resource block body are the configuration arguments for the resource. We have one argument defined, which is the name,  referencing the input variable okta_group_name</p>

   <code>resource "okta_group" "okta_test_group" {
  name = var.okta_group_name
}
</code>   

<p>Open <code>terraform/variables.tf</code> and uncomment the following entry. This is the variables file for the parent or main module. The variables within this file are assigned via the <code>tfvars</code> files, which are passed in with environment-specific configurations via the Terraform CLI:</p>

   <code>variable "okta_group_name" {
  type = string
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>terraform/main.tf</code> and uncomment the following entry. The main file contains critical configurations for the backend and providers (like Okta or AWS). It also is where we reference any modules, including the directory module, via their path within the local repository. It’s also necessary to pass through any variables within this module block. You can manage variables in two ways:</p>
 
   Configure the variable values directly within the main file, which may be acceptable for any standardized or non-environment-specific variables 
   Reference the parent module variables file like we have done, so in this example: 
 

   <code>okta_group_name = var.okta_group_name
</code>   

<p>Open <code>terraform/dev.tfvars</code> and <code>terraform/prod.tfvars</code> and uncomment the following entry. This sets the value of the okta_group_name variable for each respective environment. Feel free to change it and make the values environment-specific.</p>

   <code>okta_group_name = "Okta Test Group GitHub Actions"
</code>   

<p>Now, we can stage our changes. Use <code>git add</code> to add the changes for the next commit.</p>

   <code>git add .
</code>   

<p>Lastly, commit the changes:</p>

   <code>git commit -m "Initial commit"
</code>   

<p>With the changes committed, we can now push your changes to the remote <code>develop</code> branch.</p>

   <code>git push origin develop
</code>   

 GitHub Actions triggers Terraform dev build 

<p>GitHub Actions is configured to trigger a build when changes are pushed to the <code>develop</code> branch. The workflow defined in the repository will:</p>
 
   Authenticate with AWS: Use GitHub OIDC to assume the necessary role. 
   Run Terraform Commands: Execute terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to deploy changes to the development environment. 
 

<p>Monitor the action in GitHub to ensure the build completes successfully, and check your Okta environment to observe the creation of the group using the name specified in the tfvars file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If GitHub Actions has any errors, refer to the error message within the GitHub Actions workflow for further details.</p>

  <p>If you missed any configurations within the repository files (e.g., <code>backend-*.conf</code> or <code>vars-*.tfvars</code>), make the changes locally and perform the <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> commands again.</p>

  <p>If you missed any configurations within Okta (e.g., OAuth 2.0 scopes) or AWS (e.g., IAM Role permissions, etc.), then correct the issue and re-run the GitHub Actions workflow from the GitHub Actions console on a failed workflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a pull request to merge code from the <code>develop</code> branch to the <code>main</code> branch:</p>

 
   Navigate to the repository on GitHub. 
   Open a pull request from <code>develop</code> to <code>main.</code> 
   Provide a detailed description of the changes and any context or considerations for the reviewers. 
 

 GitHub Actions trigger Terraform prod plan 

<p>When a pull request is opened, GitHub Actions triggers a Terraform plan for the production environment. This plan will:</p>
 
   Authenticate with AWS: Use GitHub OIDC to assume the necessary role. 
   Run Terraform Plan: Execute terraform init,  terraform plan to show the potential changes without applying them against the production environment. 
 

<p>Reviewers can inspect the planned output to understand the impact of the changes before merging.</p>

<p>After reviewing and approving the pull request, merge it into the <code>main</code> branch. You can merge using the GitHub Pull Request user interface.</p>

 GitHub Actions trigger Terraform prod build 

<p>Merging to the main branch triggers a new GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow will:</p>
 
   Authenticate with AWS: Use GitHub OIDC to assume the necessary role. 
   Run Terraform Commands: Execute terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to deploy changes to the production environment. 
 

<p>Monitor the Actions tab to ensure the deployment completes successfully.</p>

<p>There’s little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftereffects have had a dramatic impact on the retail sector, with many retailers seeing a marked uptick in traffic through their digital channels as consumers embrace the freedom of shopping from anywhere at any time. The eCommerce share of total sales continues to rise by roughly 7.5% annually, and hybrid shopping has taken off, with consumers shopping at least partially online 55% of the time.1&nbsp;This increase in digital interaction tends to go hand in hand with a requirement for a modern, best-of-breed Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) platform in order to truly capitalize on the upsell and cross-sell opportunities that come from increased consumer stickiness and personalization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many retailers agree that legacy identity systems – often tightly coupled with existing CRM or ecommerce platforms – reduce agility and negatively impact user experience, it can seem daunting to embark on a migration project, particularly when the impacts of migrating a large existing customer base to that new platform are considered. Nevertheless, migration is often a necessary first step in fulfilling other key digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to see how retailers can alleviate these concerns and tackle the migration process with confidence – without leaving a single customer behind.</p>

<p>What if the key to your hotel room was suddenly useless, and your personal information was floating in the digital ether? This happened after the recent MGM Resorts cyberattack; the vulnerabilities in our current cybersecurity measures have been laid bare. The incident disrupted the company’s services and jeopardized sensitive customer data, raising serious questions about the efficacy of traditional security protocols.</p>
<p>We will dive into the MGM Resorts cyberattack to uncover the shortcomings in current cybersecurity measures. You’ll also understand why traditional security measures are failing us and how adopting identity-based authentication can safeguard your organization against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.</p>
 Unpacking the Security Incident 
<p>The MGM Resorts cyberattack represents a significant breach in cybersecurity measures, disrupting the company’s services and jeopardizing customer data. The event exposes critical vulnerabilities in organizations that may appear otherwise secure and highlights the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity protocols.</p>
 What Happened? 
<p>On September 11, 2023, MGM Resorts announced they were experiencing a “cybersecurity issue,” which turned out to be more devastating than initially perceived. The company had to shut down various services, ranging from digital room keys to slot machines, resulting in many inconveniences for its guests.</p>
 Timeline of Events 
<p>The company detected the breach and shut down the affected systems to mitigate further damage. Over the next few days, guests and employees faced many problems. Websites for MGM’s numerous properties were offline, and the organization had to resort to manual operations, such as handwritten receipts for casino winnings and long lines for room check-ins.</p>
 Data Types Affected 
<p>The breach compromised a wide variety of data types, potentially including customer personal information and financial details. While the specifics are not yet fully disclosed, the scope of affected data types suggests that the breach could have far-reaching implications for the resort’s guests.</p>
 Affected Stakeholders 
<p>The cyberattack has consequences that extend beyond MGM Resorts. Guests, employees, and possibly even shareholders are affected by the breach. Customers are particularly concerned about their personal and financial information safety, and employees face the challenge of maintaining operations under compromised conditions.</p>
 Why Did It Happen? 
<p>The cyberattack was orchestrated using social engineering tactics, specifically vishing, which involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information over the phone. These tactics exploited human vulnerabilities rather than technological ones, making the attack highly effective.</p>
 Vulnerabilities Exploited 
<p>The primary vulnerability lies in MGM’s human capital. The attackers used publicly available information and a convincing phone manner to gain unauthorized access to MGM’s systems. This form of social engineering underscores the need for better staff training and awareness to prevent future attacks. But it brings to light a deeper issue. Security teams need a way to take end users out of the critical path of cyberattacks and maintain continuous control of network security. But how?</p>
 Shortcomings in Current Authentication Systems 
<p>MGM’s existing authentication protocols were inadequate in preventing a vishing-based attack. The attackers impersonated an MGM employee by calling the IT service desk to obtain the necessary credentials. This exposes critical flaws in the company’s verification systems, raising questions about the efficacy of its cybersecurity measures.</p>
 The Inadequacies of Half-Measures in Authentication 
<p>As seen from the MGM cyber attack, relying on single-factor authentication is a glaring example of outdated security. This method must be revised today when cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated.</p>
<p>Although a step in the right direction, multi-factor authentication can fall short if not implemented correctly. For instance, using easily accessible information as a second factor, like a text message sent to a phone, can be intercepted and exploited.</p>
<p>The evolution of security measures has brought us from simple passwords to biometrics and beyond. Yet, many businesses are stuck in the past, relying on these half-measures.</p>
<p>It’s not just about keeping up with the times; it’s about safeguarding your organization’s future. One-size-fits-all solutions are ineffective, and risk-based authentication should be the norm, not the exception.</p>
 Why They Are Insufficient 
<p>Security half-measures, like using codes, devices, or unverified biometrics as identity proxies, are more than just weak points; they open doors for cybercriminals. The MGM breach is a stark reminder of the dangers of compromised security. Beyond financial loss, the real cost lies in eroded customer trust and potential legal consequences that can linger and deeply affect your business.</p>
 Why Businesses Must Move Beyond 
<p>Inadequate security comes with a hefty price tag, and it’s about more than immediate financial losses. Legal consequences and regulatory fines can cripple a business. However, the real challenge lies in restoring customer trust once lost. The MGM breach underscores the urgency for businesses to upgrade from outdated security protocols.</p>
<p>It’s time for businesses to take this issue seriously and invest in robust, up-to-date security protocols that adapt to emerging threats.</p>
 The Case for Identity-Based Authentication 
 Advantages of Identity-Based Authentication 
<p>Identity-based authentication is not just a feature; it’s a paradigm shift in how we, 1Kosmos, approach security. Traditional methods often rely on something the user knows, like a password, which is vulnerable to attacks. Our platform, however, offers a more advanced and secure approach.</p>
 User Convenience 
<p>One of the standout features of our platform is the convenience it offers to users. Physical attributes used for biometric verification, such as fingerprints or iris scans, are not vulnerable to damage or unexpected alterations. This ensures a swift and user-friendly authentication process, eliminating the need for cumbersome passwords or other traditional methods.</p>
 Flexible Use Cases 
<p>We understand that different scenarios demand different authentication methods. Whether the situation calls for a fingerprint, iris scan, voice match, or any other biometric identifier, our platform provides adaptable and affordable authenticators. This flexibility ensures that the authentication methods can adjust seamlessly as business needs evolve.</p>
 Empirical Data Supporting the Case 
<p>The effectiveness of our identity-based authentication is not theoretical; it’s proven. With&nbsp; industry leading Target Accept Rate (TAR) and False Accept Rate (FAR), our platform offers high accuracy in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our capabilities and certifications to NIST, FIDO2, and iBeta are a testament to the system’s capability to reduce the risk of unauthorized access drastically. Our capabilities mean fewer false positives and negatives, streamlining the user experience while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
 How Using 1Kosmos Helps Adopt A Proactive Approach 
 Multi-factor Authentication 
<p>Our multi-factor authentication system, bolstered by the integration of LiveID, is designed to be non-phishable, directly addressing one of the most common vulnerabilities that cybercriminals exploit.</p>
<p>What sets our multi-factor authentication apart? With LiveID, cybercriminals find themselves at a dead end. There’s nothing to steal, even if they attempt to compromise any factor. This unique feature ensures that our MFA system remains solid, secure and virtually impenetrable, providing an unparalleled layer of protection.</p>
<p>This is a game-changer for businesses striving to maintain high-security levels without compromising user convenience. By harnessing the power of LiveID, organizations can deploy a formidable defense against threats while ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
 Biometric Encryption 
<p>Biometrics in our system are more than just a security feature; they’re foundational. Our liveness detection ensures users are genuine humans, guarding against bots or deepfake attempts essential for tasks like privileged access management and employment verification. But we elevate this with biometric encryption, where a biometric template and a public-private key pair work to encrypt and decrypt personal data, making unauthorized access nearly impossible.</p>
<p>BlockID stands out with its decentralized approach. Instead of central storage, user biometrics are kept private, minimizing attack surfaces. This bolsters security and ensures that biometrics requiring minimal user training can be swiftly and seamlessly integrated across organizations.</p>
 Compliance 
<p>Our platform, anchored in a private blockchain, is designed with user privacy as a forethought, not an afterthought. We don’t just align with GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA – we aim higher. 1Kosmos BlockID secures user personal information, easing GDPR-related challenges and cementing user trust. Additionally, our transparent log provides a clear “chain-of-custody,” which is invaluable for investigations relating to external threats or internal “friendly fraud” scenarios. In all aspects, our focus is to earn trust and ensure integrity.</p>
<p>The cyberattack on MGM Resorts highlights the pressing need for businesses to modernize their security approaches. And it can happen to anyone. While legacy systems were once the pinnacle of security, they now have fundamental limitations in the face of evolving threats. 1Kosmos BlockID advanced, identity-based verification and authentication platform, which are readily available, is user-friendly, private by design and represents the forefront of contemporary security solutions.

<p>We are thrilled to announce an exciting new development for KILT, its community and all Polkadot parachains: a seamless token bridge to Ethereum with the Project Polar Path, developed by the KILT Core&nbsp;Team.</p><p>Thanks to Polar Path, the KILT token is making its first leap beyond Polkadot and onto the Ethereum blockchain. This marks a crucial milestone in our journey towards a true multi-chain future, bringing more flexibility and exposure to KILT. In the near future, we plan to extend to even more blockchain networks, but today, we want to introduce the first step in this broader&nbsp;vision.</p> About Project Polar&nbsp;Path <p>Project Polar Path is a breakthrough feature for Polkadot parachains, enabling seamless token switches between Polkadot and Ethereum. At its core, Polar Path is a pallet specifically designed for Polkadot parachains. It has already been implemented on the KILT blockchain, leveraging Snowbridge — a secure, trustless bridge connecting Polkadot and Ethereum.</p><p>Snowbridge has already allowed ERC-20 tokens to cross over from Ethereum to Polkadot, but so far, the reverse has been a challenge. That’s where Polar Path comes in. It enables the conversion of native parachain tokens (like KILT) into an Ethereum-compatible version (ERC-20) and vice versa, providing a solution for parachains looking to expand their presence on Ethereum.</p> General Parachain Token Conversion vs. KILT’s Implementation <p>Polar Path’s ability to switch parachain tokens into ERC-20 tokens can be used by any parachain on Polkadot. However, the implementation for KILT includes a key distinction: when switching KILT tokens between Polkadot and Ethereum, the total supply of KILT always remains constant. For each KILT token that exists on the KILT blockchain, there is exactly one KILT ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Whenever a KILT token is switched to an ERC-20 KILT token on Ethereum, the corresponding KILT token on Polkadot is locked and unavailable. Conversely, when the ERC-20 KILT token is sent back to Polkadot, it is locked and unavailable, and the original KILT token is unlocked. This ensures a one-to-one relationship between KILT on Polkadot and its bridged ERC-20 counterpart on Ethereum, maintaining the overall token supply and preventing inflation or duplication of tokens across&nbsp;chains.</p> Why Polar Path&nbsp;Matters <p>Expanding to Ethereum and other ecosystems creates significant opportunities for KILT and similar parachain projects:</p>  Increased Exposure: Integrating with Ethereum connects KILT tokens to one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, allowing holders to access a broad array of DeFi products and services.  Wider Reach: Ethereum’s vast developer and user community enhances KILT’s visibility, driving broader recognition and adoption within the crypto&nbsp;space.  Trustless, Secure Switches: Thanks to Snowbridge’s architecture, Polar Path ensures all token switches between networks remain secure and trustless, preserving user confidence without sacrificing security.   Visual Interface for Token Switching <p>To make the process user-friendly, the <a href="https://galaniprojects.de/">Galani Projects </a>team, a valued contributor to the Polkadot community, has developed a proof-of-concept web interface. With this tool, users can seamlessly switch their KILT tokens to ERC-20 tokens using wallets connected to both networks. The interface makes it easy for users to specify the amount, source, and destination accounts, and with a few clicks, they can complete the&nbsp;switch.</p><p>In the future, Galani Projects plans to make this code open-source, enabling other parachain projects to use the interface for their tokens as&nbsp;well.</p> Overcoming Development Challenges <p>One of the key challenges in developing Polar Path was navigating Polkadot’s Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) and the associated fees. To simplify the user experience, we devised a solution that allows users to pay XCM fees in DOT by sending them to the KILT sovereign account on Polkadot’s AssetHub. Once the DOTs arrive, they are burned, and an XCM callback is triggered automatically. This process takes only about 30–40 seconds and eliminates the need for users to interact directly with KILT for fee payments.</p> Future Plans for KILT: Multi-Chain Expansion <p>Our Ethereum expansion is just the beginning. We are actively working on extending KILT’s multi-chain presence to other prominent blockchain networks. The vision is to have KILT tokens accessible across various ecosystems, offering even more flexibility and opportunities for our community.</p><p>Stay tuned as we continue to roll out updates and new features that will further enhance the flexibility, security, and functionality of KILT tokens across different networks!</p><p>You can <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/switch-and-trade-polkadot-and-ethereum-tokens-with-polar-path-439dd563cac7">learn how to bridge your KILT tokens&nbsp;here</a>.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, enabling secure, practical identity solutions for enterprises and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/expanding-horizons-kilt-tokens-first-move-towards-multi-chain-with-ethereum-1ff2f5606fb1">Expanding Horizons: KILT Token’s First Move Towards Multi-Chain With Ethereum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Passkeys on Windows: New platform features&nbsp;</p>


<p>Technical Fundamentals and Features</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an exciting year for us as we’re bringing some great passkey features to Windows users. In this session, I’ll discuss our new capabilities for synced passkeys protected by Windows Hello, and I’ll walk through a plugin model for third-party passkey providers to integrate with our Windows experience. Taken together, these features make passkeys more readily available wherever users need them, with the experience, flexibility, and durability that users should expect when using their passkeys on Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We love passkeys - but how can we convince a billion users?&nbsp;</p>


<p>Keynote </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s clear that passkeys will be core component of a passwordless future. The useability and security advantages are clear. What isn’t as clear is how we actually convince billions of users to step away from a decades-long relationship with passwords and move to something new. Join us as we share insights on how to accelerate adoption when users, platforms, and applications needs are constantly evolving. We will share practical UX patterns and practices, including messaging, security implications,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>and how going passwordless changes the concept of account recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>Stop counting actors... Start describing authentication events&nbsp;</p>


<p>Vision and Future &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We began deploying multifactor authentication because passwords provided insufficient security. More factors equal more security, right? Yes, but we continue to see authentication attacks such as credential stuffing and phishing! The identity industry needs to stop thinking in the quantity of authentication factors and start thinking about the properties of the authentication event. As we transition into the era of passkeys, it’s time to consider how we describe the properties of our authentication event. In this talk, we’ll demonstrate how identity providers and relying parties can communicate a consistent, composable collection of authentication properties. To raise the security bar and provide accountability, these properties must communicate not only about the authentication event, but about the security primitives underlying the event itself. These properties can be used to drive authentication and authorization decisions in standalone and federated environments, enabling clear, consistent application of security controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Change announcements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Security improvements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upcoming MFA enforcement on Microsoft Entra admin center</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to providing our customers with the highest level of security, we previously <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/update-on-mfa-requirements-for-azure-sign-in/ba-p/4177584">announced</a> that Microsoft will require multifactor authentication (MFA) for users signing into Azure. We’d like to share an update that the scope of MFA enforcement includes <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> in addition to the Azure portal and Intune admin center. This change will be rolled out in phases, allowing organizations time to plan their implementation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 1:&nbsp;Starting on or after October 15, 2024, MFA will be required to sign into the Entra admin center, Azure portal, and Intune admin center. The enforcement will gradually roll out to all tenants worldwide. This phase will not impact other Azure clients such as the Azure Command Line Interface, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 2:&nbsp;Beginning in early 2025, gradual enforcement of MFA at sign-in for the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools will commence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft will send a 60-day advance notice to all Entra global admins by email and through Azure Service Health Notifications to notify them of the start date of enforcement and required actions. Additional notifications will be sent through the Azure portal, Entra admin center, and the M365 message center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some customers may need additional time to prepare for this MFA requirement. Therefore, Microsoft will allow extended time for customers with complex environments or technical barriers. The notification from us will also include details about how customers can postpone the start date of enforcement for their tenants, the duration of the postponement, and a link to apply. To learn more, read the blog, “<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/mfa-enforcement-for-microsoft-entra-admin-center-sign-in-coming/ba-p/4230849">MFA enforcement for Microsoft Entra admin center sign-in coming soon</a>.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Date change announcement: Deprecation of keychain-backed device identity for Apple devices</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-entra-june-2024/ba-p/3796387">announced</a> the upcoming deprecation of keychain-backed device identity for Apple devices on the Microsoft Entra ID platform. The previously announced deprecation date of June 2026 has been accelerated to June 2025 as part of our commitment to secure design and defaults. This change is being made to enhance device security and better protect your data.</p>

<p>Once in effect, this deprecation will ensure that newly registered Apple devices managed by Microsoft Entra ID use strong, hardware-bound cryptographic secrets, backed by Apple’s Secure Enclave.

<p>New Certificate Authorities (CAs) for login.microsoftonline.com: Action required from customers who only trust DigiCert certificates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID is introducing new Certificate Authorities (CAs) for server certificates for the domain login.microsoftonline.com. Currently, connections to login.microsoftonline.com are exclusively presented with DigiCert certificates. Starting on October 1, 2024, you may also encounter certificates issued by Microsoft Azure CAs. This update is designed to enhance security and improve the resilience of Entra ID. This could impact customers who do not trust Microsoft Azure CAs or have pinned client-side to DigiCert certificates, as they may experience authentication failures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended Action:</p>
<p>To prevent potential issues, we recommend trusting all Root and Subordinate CAs listed in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-ca-details?tabs=root-and-subordinate-cas-list">Azure Certificate public documentation</a>. This documentation has included Microsoft Azure CAs for over a year. If you are an Entra ID user who uses the login.microsoftonline.com domain, it’s crucial to remove any client-side pinning to DigiCert and trust the new Azure CAs for a seamless transition. For more details on how to ensure uninterrupted and secure service, please read the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-ca-details?tabs=root-and-subordinate-cas-list#client-compatibility-for-public-pkis">Client Compatibility for public PKIs</a> documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Copilot update to enterprise data protection</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, we made several updates to the free Microsoft Copilot service for users with a Microsoft Entra account to enhance data security, privacy, and compliance and simplify the user experience. For users signed in with an Entra account, Microsoft Copilot will offer enterprise data protection (EDP) and redirect users to a new simplified, ad-free user interface designed for work and education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With EDP in Microsoft Copilot, your data is private, it isn’t used to train foundation models, and we help protect it at rest and in transit with encryption. For more details on EDP, please review our <a href="https://aka.ms/EDPLearn">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you or your users have a Microsoft 365 subscription in addition to an Entra account, you can enable in-app access by pinning Microsoft Copilot. If you elect to pin Microsoft Copilot for your users, it will appear in the Microsoft 365 app starting mid-September, and it will be coming soon to Microsoft Teams and Outlook. Additional functionality in Microsoft Copilot like chat history is also available for users with a Microsoft 365 subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For additional information about these changes, whether you or your users have a Microsoft 365 subscription or not, please visit our <a href="https://aka.ms/MsftCopilot-MTCBlog">blog</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/MsftCopilot-BlogFAQ">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited as we are about these updates to Microsoft Copilot. If you would like to try Microsoft Copilot updated with enterprise data protection prior to mid-September, a private preview is available (space limited). To apply, please fill out our <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotPreviewSignup">form</a>.</p>

<p>Enable Browser Access (EBA) by default for all Android users</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ongoing security hardening, we are deprecating the Enable Browser Access (EBA) user interface in the Android Authenticator and Company Portal apps. Consequently, browser access will be enabled by default for all Android users. This change will occur automatically, so no action is required from admins or Android users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restricted permissions on Directory Synchronization Accounts (DSA) role in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Cloud Sync</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ongoing security hardening, we’ve removed unused permissions from the privileged "Directory Synchronization Accounts" role. This role is exclusively used by Connect Sync and Cloud Sync to synchronize Active Directory objects with Entra ID. There is no action required by customers to benefit from this hardening. Please <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-synchronization-accounts">refer to the documentation</a> for details on the revised role permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upcoming improvements to the SSO enrollment dialog</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re making some improvements to the end user experience when users add their account to a Windows device. We've refined the messaging in the SSO enrollment dialog (consent) to make it easier for end users to understand the choice(s) they can make and the impact of their choice(s). The changes also include a 'Learn more' link on the screen. The link points to a Microsoft Learn article that provides users with more information that will further enable them to make informed choice(s). The new SSO enrollment dialog will be gradually introduced starting in October 2024. Please check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/user-help/sso-dialog-faqs">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Important Update: Azure AD Graph Retirement</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/june-2024-update-on-azure-ad-graph-api-retirement/ba-p/4094534">retirement of the Azure AD Graph API service</a> began on 1 September 2024, and will eventually impact both new and existing applications. As we deploy the phase starting over the coming weeks, new applications will not be able to use Azure AD Graph APIs unless they are configured for extended access. Microsoft Graph is the replacement for Azure AD Graph APIs, and we strongly recommend immediately migrating use of Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph and limiting any further development using Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timeline for incremental retirement of Azure AD Graph API service &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Phase start date &nbsp;</p>


<p>Impact to existing apps &nbsp;</p>


<p>Impact to new apps &nbsp;</p>




<p>1 September&nbsp; 2024 &nbsp;</p>


<p>None. &nbsp;</p>


<p>New apps are blocked from using Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the app is configured to allow extended Azure AD Graph access by setting <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">blockAzureAdGraphAccess</a> to false.   Any new apps must use Microsoft Graph &nbsp;</p>




<p>1 February 2025  &nbsp;</p>


<p>Application is unable make requests to Azure AD Graph APIs unless it is configured to allow extended Azure AD Graph access by setting <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">blockAzureAdGraphAccess</a> to false.   &nbsp;</p>




<p>1 July 2025 &nbsp;</p>


<p>Azure AD Graph is fully retired. No Azure AD Graph API requests will function. &nbsp;</p>




<p> </p>
<p>Action required:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid service disruptions, please follow <a href="https://aka.ms/AzureADGraphMigration">our instructions</a> to migrate applications to Microsoft Graph APIs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you need to extend Azure AD Graph access for an app to July 2025</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not fully completed app migrations to Microsoft Graph, you can extend this retirement. If you set the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute to false in the application’s a<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">uthenticationBehaviors</a> configuration, the application will be able to use Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025. Further documentation can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http#allow-extended-azure-ad-graph-access-until-june-30-2025">here</a>.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New applications will receive a 403 error when attempting to access Azure AD Graph APIs unless this setting is set to false. For existing applications that will not complete migration to Microsoft Graph in 2024, you should plan to set this configuration now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need to find Applications in your tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> feature provides recommendations to put your tenant in a secure and healthy state, while also helping you maximize the value of the features available in Entra ID.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve provided <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/recommendation-migrate-to-microsoft-graph-api">two Entra recommendations</a> that show information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations can support your efforts to identify and migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph. </p>

<p>Important Update: AzureAD PowerShell and MSOnline PowerShell retirement</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, the legacy Azure AD PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell Preview, and MS Online modules <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">are deprecated</a>. These modules will continue to function through March 30, 2025, after which they will be retired and stop functioning. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a> is the replacement for these modules and you should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you identify usage of Azure AD PowerShell in your tenant, you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra Recommendation</a> titled Migrate Service Principals from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph. This recommendation will show vendor applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant, including AzureAD PowerShell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra, with the recent Public Preview launch of the <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraPSPreview">Microsoft Entra PowerShell</a> module. This new module builds upon the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and brings scenario-focused cmdlets. It’s fully interoperable with all cmdlets in the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, enabling you to perform complex operations with simple, well documented commands. The module also offers a backward compatibility option to simplify migration from the deprecated AzureAD Module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph APIs were <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/changelog?search=e22b3741-9f9a-4d25-af9d-e935018a8b68">recently made available</a> to read and configure Per-user MFA settings for users, and availability in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets is soon to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>License assignment modifications will no longer be supported in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a courtesy reminder that, in mid-September, we rolled out a change that no longer supports the modification of user and group license assignments in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center and the Microsoft Azure Admin Portal. Moving forward, you will have read-only access to license assignments in these portals. If you wish to modify user and group license assignments via the user interface, you will need to visit the <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com">Microsoft 365 Admin Center</a>. Please note that this change does not impact the API or PowerShell modules. If you experience any issues with license assignment, please reach out to Microsoft 365 support.

<p>Dynamic type versioning in Bicep templates for Microsoft Graph</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2024, we're introducing an update to the Bicep templates for Microsoft Graph public preview. The dynamic types feature enables semantic versioning for Microsoft Graph Bicep types for both beta and v1.0. During Bicep file authoring, you specify a Microsoft Graph Bicep type version referenced from the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmcr.microsoft.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7Cf7b9cc3bae5c4f18e39808dcd80e1069%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638622802146892388%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=a2U6Sj6dzAOEKjxciGyHv3o4hLBd7FSXV%2FxMk7ooNt4%3D&amp;reserved=0">Microsoft artifact registry</a>, instead of using a built-in Nuget package which is the current experience. Using dynamic types will allow for future breaking changes in existing Microsoft Graph Bicep resource types without impacting deployment of your existing Bicep files that use older versions of those resource types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built-in types are deprecated and will be retired on January 24, 2025. Until the retirement date, built-in types will coexist with the new dynamic types. Any Microsoft Graph Bicep type changes will only be available through new versions of the dynamic types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action required:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switch to the new dynamic types before 24th January 2025 to avoid Bicep template deployment failures. The switch will involve making some minor updates to your bicepconfig.json and main Bicep files. Additionally, to take advantage of any updated or new Microsoft Graph resource types, you will need to update the type version that your Bicep files use. For next steps, click <a href="https://aka.ms/graphBicepDynamicTypes">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retirement of legacy user authentication methods management experience in Entra Portal</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting October 31st, 2024, we will retire the ability to manage user authentication methods in the Entra Portal via the legacy user interface (UI). Instead, we will only surface the modern UI which has full parity with the legacy experience in addition to the ability to manage modern methods (e.g. Temporary Access Pass, Passkeys, QR+Pin, etc.) and settings. This will not impact how end users can manage their own authentication methods or their ability to sign-in to Entra. Learn more at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userdevicesettings">Manage user authentication methods for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deprecating Enable Browser Access (EBA) UI</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EBA is a feature in Android broker apps (such as Company Portal and Authenticator) that enables duplicating the Entra ID device registration certificate to a global keychain location on the Android device. This allows browsers that are not integrated with brokers, such as Chrome, to access the certificate for device authentication, which is required to comply with Entra device compliance policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our overall security hardening efforts, we're migrating Entra ID device registration certificates and Android device identities to be hardware-bound. This will enable token protection policies in the future and protect against bypassing device compliance policies. Since the device identity will be hardware-bound, the EBA UI will no longer be able to duplicate and export keys on demand. We plan to deprecate the Enable Browser Access (EBA) UI in the Authenticator and Company Portal apps, and browser access (e.g., Chrome) will automatically be enabled during device registration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This capability already exists for Intune MDM users. The change extends it to non-Intune users, such as those using VMWare and Jamf mobile device management (MDM) software. This will apply to all customers in the first half of the 2025 calendar year. No action is required from customers at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deferred changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-entra/ba-p/3796395">October 2023</a> we shared that starting June 2024 the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center that states "restrict user ability to access groups features in My Groups" would be retired. These changes are under review and will not take place as originally planned. A new deprecation date will be announced in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Security Info Add Sign-In Method picker user interface update</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a courtesy reminder that, starting in August 2024, the "Add Sign-In Method" dialog on the My Security Info page was updated with improved sign-in method descriptions and a modern look and feel. With this change, when users click "Add Sign-In Method," they will initially be recommended to register the strongest method available to them, as allowed by the organization's authentication method policy. Users will also have the option to select "Show More Options" and choose from all available sign-in methods permitted by their policy. No admin action is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisioning UX modernization</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re modernizing the current application/HR provisioning and cross-tenant sync UX. This includes a new overview page, user experience to configure connectivity to your application, scoping, and attribute mappings experience. The new experience includes all functionality available to customers today, and no customer action required. The new experience will start rolling out at the end of October 2024, but customers can still use the existing experience through January 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enhancing user experience 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving from a browse-based to a search-based solution for access package discovery</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're excited to introduce a new feature in <a href="https://myaccess.microsoft.com/">My Access</a>: a curated list of recommended access packages. This will allow users to quickly view the most relevant access packages without scrolling through a long list.  The final tab will be a complete, searchable list of all <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-edit">visible</a> access packages in the tenant. We’ll deploy this to all customers as an opt-in preview by the end of October, with in-product messaging to highlight the change. By the end of November, it will transition to an opt-out preview, with general availability planned for December.</p>

<p>In this episode of The Future of Identity Podcast, I’m joined by Rohan Pinto, Co-founder and CTO of 1Kosmos, a company at the forefront of decentralized identity and passwordless authentication solutions. We explore the evolution of identity management and the journey from blockchain-based beginnings to building secure, user-controlled identity systems that go beyond traditional centralized approaches.<br><br>We dive into several key topics, including:<br><br>- Rohan’s background in identity and access management, and his transition into building cryptographic solutions that emphasize user control over their identities.<br>- The role of blockchain as an enabler in identity verification and why it’s not the complete solution to today’s identity challenges.<br>- 1Kosmos’s unique approach to authentication, including their pivot from blockchain to passwordless access using biometric verification.<br>- The challenges and potential of user-controlled identity and verifiable credentials, and why widespread adoption has been slower than expected.<br>- Rohan’s perspective on the future of identity, including how decentralized identifiers and biometrics will reshape how we access systems and interact with digital services.<br><br>Rohan shares insights from his new book and offers a deep dive into the complexities and opportunities of building a more secure, user-centric identity ecosystem. This episode is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of identity, security, and the evolving digital landscape.<br><br>You can learn more about 1Kosmos at <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/">1kosmos.com</a>.<br><br>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

 bci/acc: A Pragmatic Path to Compete with Artificial Superintelligence  An e/acc zoom-in on brain interfaces, towards human superintelligence  Summary <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence">Artificial superintelligence</a> (ASI) is perhaps 3–10 years away. Humanity needs a competitive substrate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface">BCI</a> is the most pragmatic path. Therefore, we need to accelerate BCI and take it to the masses: bci/acc. How do we make it happen? We’ll need BCI killer apps like silent messaging to create market demand, which in turn drive BCI device evolution. The net result is human superintelligence (HSI).</p><p>bci/acc draws on today’s technologies without requiring big scientific breakthroughs. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism">e/acc</a> zoomed-in for BCI. It’s solarpunk: optimistic and perhaps a little gonzo.

Introduction <p>It was summer 1995. In the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/12/beta-5/">pages</a> of Wired magazine, I read about a new product <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-09-20-fi-47933-story.html">called</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPefnLfKlY">MindDrive</a>: “The first computer product operated by human thought”. I was skeptical. But I had to try it! So I dropped $150 and got&nbsp;one.</p><p>I’d slip the MindDrive on my index finger, and boot up into the game “MindSkier”. I’d ski downhill in first-person view, and try to steer between the 30 or so pairs of gates. I’d steer by “thinking”. It was actually an echo of my thoughts: the device’s gold-plated sensor tracked my skin conductivity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity">GSR</a>). I would miss about 30% of the gates, compared to missing 80% of them if the device wasn’t on my finger at all. It worked, barely. A starting point for the&nbsp;next!</p>Left: the MindDrive. Right: In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290220-rosie-revere-engineer">Rosie Revere, Engineer</a>, Rosie’s great aunt teaches her a brilliant lesson.<p>At a giant engineering science fair, I set up the MindDrive for anyone to try. There was a line around the block [Spec1999]. There was a latent interest in&nbsp;BCI.</p><p>In 2001, I splurged $2K and bought an “Interactive Brainwave Visual Analyser” (<a href="https://ibvabrainmachine.wordpress.com/shop/brain-machines/">IBVA</a>). I’d wear a blue headband holding sticky electrodes to sense electrical signals on my forehead, i.e. an electroencephalogram (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG</a>). It sent the EEG signals to my computer, which got displayed as animated 3d graphics. More usefully, I could access the signals directly with my own software — so I did. I could hack BCI! Alas, it was hard to get good signals. I also tried <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/review/ocz-nia-review-neural-impulse-actuator/">OCZ NIA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotiv#Emotiv_EPOC">Emotiv EPOC</a> later on, but they weren’t qualitatively better.</p><p>From these limited experiments — and adjacent <a href="https://www.trent.st">work in AI and analog circuits</a> — I had a feeling that BCI bandwidth could be optimized a lot. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21436527/">This 2012 work</a> from Tsinghua University confirmed my hunch, achieving moderate typing speeds [Tsh2012]. A decade of optimizing later, we’re now at <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/01/21/2023.01.21.524489.full.pdf">62 words per minute</a> (very&nbsp;good).</p><p>High-bandwidth BCI is not a scientific mystery; it’s an engineering problem.</p><blockquote>Why might we be interested in high bandwidth BCI?</blockquote><p>The answer is artificial superintelligence (ASI): AI machines with 1000x+ the cognitive ability of humans. ASI may happen as soon as 3-10 years from now. Market forces are pushing it into existence because there’s a lot of money at&nbsp;stake.</p><blockquote>How do we, as humans, have a role in a world of AI machines with 1000x our cognitive abilities?</blockquote><p>Humans need a substrate that’s actually competitive to ASI: silicon. The best way to do that is brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We’ve got to do this soon enough for ASI time scales, therefore, we need to accelerate BCI and get mass adoption. The net result will be human superintelligence (HSI).</p><p>The rest of this article has two sections:</p>  Artificial superintelligence (ASI): what’s driving ASI, ASI risk, and approaches to address&nbsp;risk.  Human superintelligence: how to accelerate BCI and achieve mass adoption, to get Humanity competitive with&nbsp;ASI.   2. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)  2.1 How market forces drive&nbsp;ASI <p>Market forces have been driving AI compute up. The plot below shows how the compute for AI training has risen, from about 1950 until now (2024). The y-axis is exponential, and each tick is another order of magnitude. Therefore while the drawn curve is linear, the trend is exponential.</p>Market forces are driving AI compute up. [<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XKtybmbjhC6mXDm5z/compute-trends-across-three-eras-of-machine-learning">Graph from LessWrong.com</a>, with my 20 PFLOPs&nbsp;overlay]<p>The compute has grown quickly. It started with 100 (1⁰²) floating point operations per second (FLOPs) in 1950, to 1⁰²⁴ now. That’s 22 orders of magnitude of compute power in three-quarters of a century. To intuit just how much growth this is: it’s the difference between 1mm, vs flying to Alpha Centauri and back 10,000&nbsp;times.</p><p>From this growth, we now have a lot of compute. To help intuition: <a href="https://twitter.com/realGeorgeHotz/status/1690894647755988993">George Hotz frames</a> 20 PetaFLOP/s as “1 person” worth of brainpower (compute). This is akin to 746 Watts being “1 horse” worth of power (1 hp). Just as it’s easier to reason about horses worth of power, it’s easier to reason about persons worth of compute. We surpassed “1 person” worth of compute in about 2012. Now we’re 10 million times beyond; it’s like all the brainpower of NYC rolled into one compute&nbsp;system.</p><p>Market forces have driven compute up because it meant more money. More compute unlocked more markets, each which was highly lucrative: from space &amp; radio to TV, from the PC to the cellphone, from the smartphone to AI now and AR/VR soon. AI has a voracious <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-indicates-meta-is-spending-billions-on-nvidia-ai-chips.html">appetite</a> for compute, with $ benefits that accrue. That’s why there’s so much money flowing into AI right now, and no sign of&nbsp;abating.</p> 2.2 Path to&nbsp;ASI <p>For decades, we’ve had AIs that can do tasks that only a human could previously do. That is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence">narrow AI</a>. Examples are <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-23254-0_18">antenna design</a> and <a href="http://www.trent.st/mojito/">analog circuit synthesis</a>. Almost as long, we’ve had AIs that can do a task at a level far exceeding a human. These are also called narrow AI. Examples are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_synthesis">digital circuit synthesis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">software compilers</a>.</p><p>We’re about to get AI that can do all tasks that only a human can previously do. That is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI). To riff on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wisdom.html">Paul Graham</a>, AIs have will have progressed from “smart” (good at one thing) to “wise” (decent at everything).</p><p>Market forces will drive AGI from 1x smarter than humans, to 2x, to 10x, then 100x, then 1000x. It will happen quickly: there is $ to be made. We’ll arrive at AI that can do all tasks at a level far exceeding any human. That is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence">artificial superintelligence</a> (ASI).</p><p>ASIs will be wildly smarter than humans. In humans 2 is an idiot and 6 is an Einstein; so what is 1000 or 1,000,000? [Rutt2024a] It’s such a difference that it’s hard to imagine as a possibility; this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> will prevent most people from truly realizing this until it’s right upon&nbsp;them.</p>ASIs will be wildly smarter than humans [From <a href="https://twitter.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1650868971032440834">@AiSafetyMemes</a>] 2.3 ASI&nbsp;Risk <p>Humans are 1000x+ smarter than ants. As humans, we don’t respect the rights of ants or “what the ants have to say”. We are their&nbsp;gods.</p><p>ASIs will be 1000x+ smarter than humans. <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/the-ai-existential-threat-and-the-bandwidth-scenario-4573c1cb085f">We</a> are now the ants. There is little guarantee that ASIs will respect our rights. This is ASI&nbsp;risk.</p><p>What will it feel like? God-like intelligence will beget god-like power: the ASIs will become our gods. In the Hyperion sci-fi series, ASIs exist, yet humans still barely comprehend them, except to know that ASI power is unimaginably vast [Hyp1989].</p><p>What can we do about ASI risk? Section 2.4 reviews various&nbsp;ideas.</p> 2.4 Approaches to ASI&nbsp;Risk  2.4.1 Idea: decelerate <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Yudkowsky</a> and others advocate to slow down or pause AI progress, then figure out how to solve ASI risk. It’s highly appealing at first glance. As with all such ideas: one must be careful, because wishing doesn’t make it&nbsp;true.</p><p>Alas, there is a problem: for such a deceleration to work, all deceleration efforts would need to be successful. If even just one entity defects, they could dominate the others. And that’s why this route likely won’t happen. There’s an AI race; at the core, it’s China vs USA, and there’s too much at stake for one side to cede speed to the other. So the race will go on. It’s like nuclear: for all the disarmament theatre, we still have the&nbsp;nukes.</p><p>Alas, what might happen is deceleration for all players except the US government and Chinese government (plus their proxies), and organized criminals. This hurts human freedom because it diminishes “voice” and “exit” for individuals, not to mention freedom to work on solving ASI risk 🤦 [Verd2023]. It’s a common trick for governments to use the banner of safety to take further control [Snow2013].</p><blockquote>“They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” — <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quote/benjamin-franklin-on-the-trade-off-between-essential-liberty-and-temporary-safety-1775#:~:text='They%20who%20can%20give%20up,'">Benjamin&nbsp;Franklin</a></blockquote><p>Perhaps most importantly, this “approach” doesn’t actually address the problem of ASI risk. That is, if AI was decelerated, then we’d still have to solve the core problem of ASI risk! That’s what most other ASI-risk approaches aim to&nbsp;do.</p> 2.4.2 Idea: let evolution happen <p>“Let evolution happen” is the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/09/artificial-intelligence-industry-future">framing</a> of Google founder Larry Page, and many others. They see humans as simply one step in the tree of evolution; that ASI is the next step; that we should be proud that we made the next step happen; and that if our biological bodies can’t compete (they can’t) then we should let go and get over it; that this is evolution.</p><p>From my work on evolutionary computation, I’ve seen how powerful evolution can be. It doesn’t matter whether we like this framing, this really could be the scenario that&nbsp;happens.</p><p>However, letting go is not a solution to ASI risk. Personally, I’d love to keep building and playing for as long as I can, in a grand adventure, until I opt-in to end that adventure. While people have invented a thousand rationalizations for death, I choose life until further notice. Humanity should be the same. We have a potential grand adventure in front of us! So we should <a href="https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night">rage, rage</a> against the dying of the light. Humanity should choose life until further&nbsp;notice.</p> 2.4.3 Idea: speed it up&nbsp;(e/acc) <p>“<a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">Effective accelerationism</a>” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism">e/acc</a>) is a movement sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos">@BasedJeffBezos</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayeslord">@BayesLord</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1713930459779129358?lang=en">extended &amp; promoted</a> by technologist / VC Marc Andreesen, among others. I find myself aligned with most of e/acc philosophy: grounded in physics, optimistic, build-up not tear-down, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>e/acc’s approach to AI is “let everyone have at it, speed it up”. It aims for a multi-polar AI world: thousands (or millions or billions) of superintelligent AIs or entities with superintelligent AIs, keeping each other in check. It’s a bit like the USA which balances power among three entities (legislative, executive, judiciary). Or, it’s like blockchains which balance power among thousands of&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Therefore, perhaps surprisingly, e/acc is likely safer than the “deceleration” approach (which only has balance among two powers)&nbsp;😲!</p><p>e/acc is also open to human superintelligence (HSI), but with no no special emphasis. It’s meant to be an umbrella idea, for others to add detail with zoom-ins.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">Vitalik Buterin</a>’s “<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html">decentralized accelerationism</a>” (d/acc) zooms in on e/acc that emphasizes decentralized technologies with a bit more bias towards safety. Like e/acc, it’s open to HSI, though with no special emphasis.</p><p>Among those thousand or billion+ superintelligent AI entities, e/acc assumes that at least some of them will be friendly to humans; and that they will help humans have a role in the future. But what if the friendly ones are overruled by the unfriendly ones? And as the ASI risk introduction covered, why would gods bother treating ants&nbsp;well?</p><p>Fortunately, e/acc is sufficiently broad that it allows for variants not needing this assumption. The most promising variant is: use BCI to get a competitive substrate, with mass adoption. That’s bci/acc! This post will elaborate below.</p> 2.4.4 Idea: put it in a cage, unplug if things go&nbsp;awry <p>First, some background. You can think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> as a really dumb robot that does just one thing: maintain a ledger of transactions. Yet it’s also sovereign: it answers to no one, it is its own independent entity, you can’t unplug it. Similarly, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> is sovereign. The <a href="http://uniswap.org">Uniswap</a> V2 decentralized exchange contracts running on Ethereum are sovereign too: they answer to no one. Arweave permanent data storage is sovereign. <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> AI-powered data feeds are sovereign. Every smart contract that doesn’t have governance is sovereign. Finally, the internet itself is sovereign. Building sovereign software systems is a solved problem. Appendix 5.1 elaborates.</p><p>With that background in place, let’s review the idea: “put the ASI in a cage, and unplug if things go&nbsp;awry”.</p><p>Here’s one problem: you can’t unplug it. The ASI is smart, so it’s already made itself decentralized, therefore sovereign, therefore un-unpluggable. Just like&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Some observers see this idea and other similarly glib “takes” as a waste of energy. The “AI Alignment Bingo” in Appendix 5.2 offers a concise (and hilarious) summary of many takes &amp; responses.</p> 2.4.5 Idea: fancier&nbsp;cage <p>The idea is to use advances in cryptography, blockchain, and more to make the cage “hack proof”. Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sergeydnazarov_the-question-is-not-whether-we-should-slow-activity-7051694784192630784-IdFg?trk=public_profile_like_view">proponent</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The problem: humans are the weak link in computer systems. Hackers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Wires-Adventures-Worlds-Wanted/dp/0316037729">Kevin Mitnick</a> have made Swiss cheese of compute systems by tricking gullible humans to give him access, not by attacking the software or hardware directly. Therefore, the “fancier cage” idea is not feasible unless we 100% solve human gullibility (not going to&nbsp;happen).</p>Loki after tricking Thor to escape a fancy cage: “Are you ever not going to fall for that?” [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txy90Qe7qc">Avengers 1</a>] 2.4.6 Idea: align via a post-hoc&nbsp;wrapper <p>This is the approach that <a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences">OpenAI took</a> for GPT. The idea is akin to installing an aftermarket exhaust system on a new car, to tune behavior in a particular direction. For example, train an unconstrained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a> first; then tack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback">RLHFs</a> training to align with human values. If all goes well, scale up this approach as we get to AGI and&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Alas, it has been shown to be easy to jailbreak, with holes everywhere, as the world has witnessed on ChatGPT running GPT4. Finding issues and adding more constraints will end up as endless whack-a-mole. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/towards-a-practice-of-token-engineering-b02feeeff7ca">I’ve been there</a>, for other AI problems. The root problem is that tacking a band-aid on such a core problem will (likely) never be&nbsp;enough.</p>Main: aligning an AI via a post-hoc wrapper is like adding an aftermarket exhaust system to your car. Bottom right: endless jailbreaks is like whack-a-mole, where as soon as you whack one issue, another pops&nbsp;up. 2.4.7 Idea: dumber AIs aligning smarter&nbsp;ones <p>This is the approach <a href="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization">published by OpenAI</a> in December 2023. The idea is to have a chain of AIs from dumb → smart, where each link is a dumber AI aligning the next-smarter AI.</p><p>Alas, this is only as strong as its weakest link (and links can be weak), there is risk of over-leverage (think 2008 financial crisis), and the ASI at the end of the chain might disagree or change the rules. Appendix 5.3 elaborates.</p> 2.4.8 Idea: align the AI while&nbsp;training <p>Can we ever align something 1000x smarter than us? This idea side steps that concern in the near term in two complementary ways:</p>  Diligently choose a training set based on strongly-held human values [Weng2023].  Start with 1x-level or even 0.1x-level as in a human baby. And then grow it to a child, then teenager, then adult, and beyond. Where it’s aligned the whole time [Goer2013].  <p>This is akin to growing square watermelons, that grow subject to human-induced constraints 🍉 🤖. The hope — but not guarantee — is that as it goes from 1x to 10x and beyond, it remains aligned to human&nbsp;values.</p><p>This approach also assumes that data-centric learning will be the trick to get to ASI. It may be one of the most important, but maybe not the most important [Rutt2024b].</p><p>There’s promise to this idea; it’s worth&nbsp;trying.</p> 2.4.9 Idea: bci/acc: get a competitive substrate via&nbsp;BCI <p>Silicon is a wildly powerful substrate: it already has amazing compute, storage and bandwidth and it keeps improving exponentially. It’s what’s powering AI, and soon, AGI and&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>This idea is: our current meatbag brains just can’t compete against silicon for processing power. It’s “1 person” of processing power vs 10&nbsp;million.</p><p>Everything that silicon touches goes exponential: the “<a href="https://youtu.be/Jm-eBD9xR3w?t=288">Silicon Midas Touch</a>”. For our brains to compete with silicon, they must touch silicon. The higher bandwidth the connection, the more that our brains can unlock the power of silicon for our&nbsp;selves.</p><p>Therefore we need to swallow our pride, stop treating carbon like a deity, and get a competitive substrate: silicon. The specific “how” is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface">brain-computer interfaces</a> (BCIs), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading">uploading</a>. The target is human superintelligence. <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge">Some</a> <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html">call</a> this “the merge”. Others, “intelligence amplification” (<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1744179910347039080?s=51&amp;t=bqvoQxSwV24RgugtHZZhKw">e/ai</a>).</p><p>Given ASI timelines of 3–10 years, simply hoping for “the merge” means that the merge likely won’t happen fast enough. We need to accelerate it somehow. The options are BCIs or uploading. Where uploading is still mostly a scientific problem and way too far out to be relevant to ASI risk. In contrast, BCI has already matured past the science into engineering problems. Of the two, BCI is the most pragmatic.</p><p>We can’t just invent an amazing BCI technology. To truly counter ASI, we need to get it in the hands of the mainstream billions.</p><p>In short, we need to accelerate BCI and get it to mass adoption. This is what bci/acc is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>Another framing of bci/acc is (in one variant): is “align the AI at the core, as you train” but in the most hyper-localized way imaginable: train one AI for every single human, where each human is constraining the AI in real-time, and the AI starts small and grows iteratively. It’s a square-watermelon AI as a co-processor to your brain 🍉&nbsp;🧠.</p>bci/acc: accelerate BCI and take it to the masses. It uses BCI killer apps like silent messaging (SMs) to create market demand, which in turn drive BCI device evolution to a substrate competitive with&nbsp;ASI 3. Human Superintelligence via&nbsp;bci/acc  3.1 Introduction <p>Accelerating BCI (bci/acc) is among the least-discussed approaches, yet it may have the best chance of success to address ASI. So it’s imperative that we explore bci/acc more&nbsp;deeply.</p> 3.1.1 High-Bandwidth BCI challenges <p>To go all the way to human superintelligence, non-invasive BCI likely won’t have enough bandwidth. We will need super-high bandwidth BCI, via neural implants (invasive) or optogenetics (semi-invasive) or other such brain technologies.</p><p>Alas, going invasive or semi-invasive has its own challenges, on engineering, regulatory, and societal&nbsp;fronts:</p>  Engineering. The main goal is to increase bandwidth — a hard enough thing on its own. Yet engineering must also solve critical privacy risks, lest we lose cognitive liberty.  Regulatory. Getting approval for human trials on (semi) invasive brain technologies is currently a long, high-friction process in the name of safety of the test subjects. Alas, the current regulatory structure ignores the much larger risk of ASI risk to Humanity: a bike-shedding problem. How can we speed this&nbsp;up?  Societal acceptance. Even if the devices existed and regulations were approved, invasive BCI currently feels icky to most people. This will affect Humanity’s ability to manage ASI risk. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton Window</a> will likely need to shift so that mass society is more open to such technologies.  <p>There are two different routes to solving challenges (1)(2)(3): implants-first and masses-first. Let’s explore&nbsp;each.</p> 3.1.2 Implants-First Route <p>Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.neuralink.com">Neuralink</a> has made great progress in the previous&nbsp;decade.</p> Tansu Yegen on Twitter: "🧠 Elon Musk announced the first successful Neuralink brain chip implant in a human. Think about telling someone 10 years ago that by 2024, we'd be on the brink of unlocking telepathy... pic.twitter.com/WHiL0GuCQw / Twitter" <p>🧠 Elon Musk announced the first successful Neuralink brain chip implant in a human. Think about telling someone 10 years ago that by 2024, we'd be on the brink of unlocking telepathy... pic.twitter.com/WHiL0GuCQw</p><p>Neuralink is perhaps the furthest along on engineering (1). Its path to regulatory (2) is to focus on healing people, which limits its speed. Societal acceptance (3) is on ice until regulatory (2) is much farther along. In short, its route is (full 1) → (full 2) → (full 3). While I’m a Neuralink fan, to maximize chance of success, I’d love to see more companies chase this&nbsp;route.</p> 3.1.3 Masses-First Route <p>Given ASI timescales, the Neuralink route to (1)(2)(3) may not be fast enough. There’s another path: route (partial 1, full 2, full 3) → (better 1, full 2, full 3) → (full 1, full 2, full 3). That is: start with non-invasive BCI tech that has no regulatory issues, and get mass adoption. Use this mass adoption to grow societal openness and open up regulations towards (semi) invasive&nbsp;BCI.</p><p>The starting point is killer apps for healthy people with non-invasive tech.</p>  Killer app. To hit the masses, BCI needs a killer app. We need to “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html">make something people want</a>”. Silent messaging (SMs) aka pragmatic telepathy is one candidate; perfect memory is another; there are more. Below, I explore candidate killer apps like silent messaging. Once we have that first killer app, we can expand to adjacent functionalities.  Healthy people. To hit the masses, BCI needs to be optimizing healthy humans versus merely fixing human ailments. Otherwise it’s not mass-market enough.  Non-invasive first. To hit the masses, the BCI needs to be non-invasive to start. Invasive won’t get enough takers at the beginning, and regulatory is a bottleneck. But to truly leverage the Silicon Midas Touch we must get to invasive. How? Pressure from market forces and ASI risk will take us over the&nbsp;hump.   3.1.4 Discussion &amp;&nbsp;Outline <p>bci/acc allows for an implants-first route, a masses-first route, and other routes. We don’t know which will be best; we should explore all of them aggressively. Since Neuralink’s actions elaborate the implants-first route, much of this post will focus on the masses-first route. (To be clear, bci/acc includes all&nbsp;routes.)</p><p>The next sections elaborate on masses-first bci/acc as follows. First, I will briefly review some emerging technologies that will help. Then, I survey some candidate BCI killer apps. Then, I describe how demands from market forces and ASI risk will drive BCI performance up. Finally, I describe how many iterations take us to human superintelligence (HSI), a new phase for Humanity.</p> 3.2 Baseline Tech for&nbsp;bci/acc <p>Humanity’s technology capability frontier keeps expanding. This section explores technologies on the market that are adjacent to bci/acc. They can be used as lego blocks towards launching the first BCI killer&nbsp;apps.</p> 3.2.1 EEG for Typing (“Silent Messaging”) <p>EEG for typing keeps improving. As mentioned earlier, as of 2023 researchers could type via EEG at <a href="https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/02/27/stanford-researchers-develop-an-incredible-brain-computer-interface-bci-system-that-can-convert-speech-related-neural-activity-into-text-at-62-words-per-minute/">62 words per minute</a>. And it keeps getting better. How do you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> wrote his books? (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/">Yes,&nbsp;EEG</a>.)</p> 3.2.2 EEG for&nbsp;Focus <p>There are other companies targeting mainstream with EEG. For example, <a href="https://www.neurable.io/">Neurable</a> is making consumer BCI headphones to help people focus. You put on their headphones, which detect electrical signals on the skin around your ear, and they ping you when you fall out of focus. There’s also EEG to track emotions, alertness, arousal, meditation effectiveness, and more&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784561-the-battle-for-your-brain?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_25">Ref</a>].</p> 3.2.3 Subtitles on&nbsp;Glasses <p><a href="https://xrai.glass/">XRAI</a>, <a href="https://www.vuzix.com/">Vuzix</a> and <a href="https://www.hearingtracker.com/resources/hear-with-your-eyes-five-ar-live-captioning-glasses">others</a> offer glasses with subtitles, for the deaf: “hear with your eyes”. The glasses have a microphone to capture audio, then transcribes via AI-based voice recognition, then renders text to the subtitles display. The tech can be inexpensive since the subtitles can use 1970s-era LCD displays, and 99% of the rest can be on a smartphone.</p> 3.2.4 AI-powered glasses with voice interface <p>11 years ago, we had Google Glass doing this. It was officially scrapped due to privacy concerns, and unofficially because society just wasn’t ready for it. Since then, we’ve had ten more years of smartphone evolution and adoption. We’re in an Instagram x TikTok era where privacy matters less, for better and for&nbsp;worse.</p><p>In October 2023, the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/">Rayban | Meta Smart Glasses</a> shipped. This device records and stores video directly from the glasses. You can tap it to send photos or videos to friends. There was no privacy or weirdness pushback. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton Window</a> had shifted: 11 years was more than enough for society to be ready. From personal experience: they’re lightweight to wear, and according to Ray-Ban employees they’re selling&nbsp;briskly.</p> 3.2.5 AR Goggles + Hand Gestures: Meta Quest&nbsp;3 <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Quest_3">Meta Quest 3</a> was released in October 2023. Whereas its predecessors were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">Virtual Reality</a> (VR) goggles, it brings in the real world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality</a> (AR), aka mixed reality or spatial computing. It scans your room, and renders real-plus-overlay into your headset’s display. It tricked my brain into “being there”. You can control it with hand gestures, but these are still unreliable; the Quest still supports handheld controllers.</p> 3.2.6 AR Goggles + Eye Tracking: Apple Vision&nbsp;Pro <p>For any given device idea, Apple may iterate for years or decades before they release it, if ever. Why? Because they only release when the device not only “doesn’t suck”, but is actually pleasant or delightful to use. This was the case for phones, for tablets, and for cars (still a&nbsp;WIP).</p><p>It’s also the case for AR goggles. They have patents on AR going back two decades. Yet they finally put a device up for presale on Jan 19, 2024: The <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>. From Apple’s perspective, they’ve cracked AR well enough to release something pleasant or delightful.</p><p>What’s changed? Eye tracking based input. Eye tracking has been used for medical research for decades, and also more widespread things things like consumer marketing for 10+ years. You can use eye tracking to type, move a cursor, click a button, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Apple Vision Pro has eye tracking. Knowing Apple’s approach to new devices, they probably already have interfaces to type, move a cursor, and click buttons — all hands free, accurate, and pleasant.</p><p>As it rolls out, there’s a good chance people will find it as magical as multi-touch in phones. Eye-tracking is to AR control, what multi-touch is to phones. It may be the remaining piece to take AR beyond video games and truly mainstream. And, it will become table stakes for AR; expect Quest 4 to have&nbsp;it.</p><p>I can’t emphasize this enough: eye-tracking may be the “unlock” that makes these head-mounted glasses or goggles actually&nbsp;useful.</p> 3.2.7 Eye-Tracking is BCI&nbsp;(!) <p>Eye tracking offers the hands-free benefits of BCI with the accuracy of moving your hands. Eye tracking feels like BCI, moving your eyes doesn’t really feel like movement. Yet it’s nearly as accurate as moving your hands, because ultimately eye tracking is motor&nbsp;control.</p><p>If a 20-year-old university student’s eyes are bloodshot, there’s a good chance they are hungover, got little sleep, or both. To generalize this, our eyes tell a lot about our health. In the last few years, there’s been an explosion of research using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video">HD</a> images or videos for medical diagnosis or treatment. A recent “Frontiers in Neuroscience” edition had 23 articles dedicated to this topic, including <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/9609/seeing-beyond-the-eye-the-brain-connection">this&nbsp;intro</a>.</p><p>So: (1) Eye tracking takes HD videos of eyes (2) HD videos of eyes are sensors for brain activity&nbsp;(3)</p><p>HD video of eyes implies a BCI sensor. Modern eye-tracking takes HD videos of your eyes. Thus, modern eye tracking is&nbsp;BCI.</p>[Quote from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/9609/seeing-beyond-the-eye-the-brain-connection">Frontiers in Neuroscience</a>] 3.3 Candidate BCI Killer&nbsp;Apps <p>We’ve covered how ASI is coming, and how Humanity’s best chance to stay competitive is to accelerate BCI and take it to the masses (bci/acc). To get BCI to mass adoption, we need an application of BCI that the masses really want to use — a killer&nbsp;app.</p><p>We don’t know which killer app might take off first. However, we can explore possibilities. This section reviews some of&nbsp;those.</p> 3.3.1 Candidate killer app: Silent Messaging <p>Just as Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40651883#:~:text=Snow%20Crash%20is%20a%20science,%2C%20cryptography%2C%20memetics%20and%20philosophy.">Snow Crash</a>” is the archetypical vision for Virtual Reality, Vernor Vinge’s 2006 novel “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/102439">Rainbows End</a>” is the archetype for Augmented Reality.</p><p>Infused throughout Rainbows End, there’s a special &lt;sm&gt; tag for when the characters are messaging each other with “silent messages” (SMs):</p><p>Vinge leaves the reader to infer what specifically SMs are. But one soon realizes that it’s messaging each other simply by thinking about it. Yes, telepathy, but presented as just part of the furniture, and it just works, therefore “pragmatic telepathy”.</p>SMing = silent messaging = sending text or voice by thinking about it. Send = eye-tracking / EEG / etc. Receive = subtitles on&nbsp;glasses.<p>How would we do this? One inputs messages via EEG BCI, eye-tracking, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization">subvocalization</a>. One receives messages via subtitles on glasses or goggles, or audio in your&nbsp;ear.</p><p>Specific implementations are any combination of the above. Examples:</p>  Glasses with subtitles + EEG BCI sensors on the top of the glasses touching your forehead inconspicuously  An Apple Earbud-like device that captures sub-vocalizations, then synthesizes speech and outputs to others as&nbsp;audio.  Apple Vision Pro for eye-tracking input and subtitles-based output. Therefore society may get (pragmatic) telepathy upon the release of Apple Vision Pro&nbsp;(!).   3.3.2 Candidate Killer App: Internal&nbsp;Dialog <p>Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a> on your shoulder, sharing advice or facts when you call upon him. Without having to pull out your phone and type; without having to read results on your screen. “What’s the capital of Portugal?” “Is this person lying to me?” “What’s next on my TO-DO list&nbsp;today?”</p><p>To achieve this is straightforward: type with BCI / eye-tracking / subvocalization. It goes to a ChatGPT bot. And the output is rendered visually in the glasses / goggles or in&nbsp;audio.</p> 3.3.3 Candidate killer app: Perfect&nbsp;Memory <p>Here, you record images / audio / video with glasses, goggles, or a necklace-style device like <a href="https://www.rewind.ai/pendant">Rewind Pendant</a>. This gets stored locally or globally.</p><p>You search for the recordings via EEG BCI, eye tracking, or sub-vocalization. Or, use near-infrared non-invasive BCI on the back of your scalp to see what’s going on in your visual cortex. It doesn’t need to be perfect; it just needs to be good enough to serve as a query across video feeds. Even ten years ago, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_lou_jepsen_could_future_devices_read_images_from_our_brains?language=en">research results</a> were extremely promising.</p><p>Once you’ve found the memory, it gets rendered in the glasses or&nbsp;goggles.</p><p>You won’t have to retrieve by moving your fingers around or anything, you’ll just be moving your eyes around, or thinking with the EEG, and you’ll be able to retrieve these videos. Everything you saw, you’ll have perfect memory of. It will feel&nbsp;magical.</p>Perfect memory. (1) Record via glass gam, then store (2) retrieve via eye-tracking / EEG / etc (3) project result on glasses’&nbsp;display 3.3.4 Candidate killer app: Share Visual&nbsp;Memories <p>Here, you search &amp; retrieve videos like in the “perfect&nbsp;memory”.</p><p>Then, you click “share” and choose “to whom” via BCI / eye-tracking / sub-vocalization.</p><p>A picture’s worth a thousand words: we’ll be able to communicate with others at higher bandwidth than ever&nbsp;before.</p> 3.3.5 Candidate Killer App: Talk in&nbsp;Pictures <p>Here, you share video to others, but no longer bound by what you’ve seen or found. Rather, you type (via BCI etc) to prompt a generative AI art system. You do this in real-time, and send the images / videos in real time to someone else. They see it and respond, in images /&nbsp;video.</p><p>Now. You’re. Talking. In. Pictures.</p> 3.3.5 Candidate Killer App: Talk in Brain&nbsp;Signals <p>We go further than talking in pictures. If the devices always displayed raw brain signals alongside text or images, then over time our brains will learn the mapping. It won’t be much different than learning Spanish, sign language, or Morse code. Our brains can handle unusual inputs, like learning to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/15/seeing-with-your-tongue">see with your tongue</a>. The net result: we could communicate directly with raw brain signals. AI research often finds “direct” to be better than using intermediate features, if there is enough data. It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93brain_interface">brain-brain interface</a>.</p><p>From this, a new kind of language — a neural language — could emerge, which will chunk lower-level abstractions into higher-level ones for higher bandwidth yet [Rutt2023c]. We’ll have transitioned from skeuomorphic languages for our brain (text/images as a bridge to the past, tuned for the outer world) to brain-native languages (tuned to our inner&nbsp;world).</p><p>This approaches the long-held science fiction dream of “<a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780195305678.001.0001/acref-9780195305678-e-379">mind meld</a>” as “a telepathic union between two beings; in general use, a deep understanding.” We can start building primitive versions&nbsp;now.</p>Mind-meld: talk in pictures, raw brain signals, or a new neural&nbsp;language 3.4 The Journey to High-Bandwidth BCI <p>We’ve discussed the risk from ASI, how BCI is the most pragmatic path, BCI challenges (engineering, regulatory, societal), and possible BCI killer apps to kick-start usage by the masses. What then? This section explores how market forces and ASI risk will drive further evolution and adoption of BCI, including a transition to more invasive technologies.</p> 3.4.1 Introduction <p>A silicon stack co-brain offers 100x+ more storage, and 100x+ more compute, compared to bio-stack brains (our current brains). Alas, these are held back by the low bandwidth between the bio-stack brain and the silicon-stack co-brain.</p><p>Non-invasive techniques like EEG, eye-tracking and subvocalization can only take us so far [BciTech]. There’s an upper bound to their bitrates; it’s not very high; and we’ll probably squeeze every last bit from&nbsp;them.</p><p>And. There are invasive techniques that promise 100x+ more bandwidth. Most promising are chip implants, and optogenetics. Let’s review those, then see how those might enter mainstream usage by healthy&nbsp;humans.</p> 3.4.2 Bandwidth++ via&nbsp;Implants <p>Here, a doctor or machine opens up a portion of your skull, slips in a chip, and seals it back up. That chip then talks to your brain, and wirelessly to computers. 100x+ the bandwidth compared to EEGs,&nbsp;boom.</p><p>Research has happened for decades. <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> is a leading example. It’s in early stages of human&nbsp;trials.</p>Implants (conceptual) 3.4.3 Bandwidth++ via Optogenetics <p>Optogenetics enables reading &amp; writing on the brain. One gets an injection containing a “useful virus” that changes specifically targeted neurons to fire when light is shined on them; and more. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395664/">Put precisely</a>:</p><blockquote>“Optogenetics is a technique to control or to monitor neural activity with light which is achieved by the genetic introduction of light-sensitive proteins. Optogenetic activators [“opsins”] are used to control neurons, whereas monitoring of neuronal activity can be performed with genetically encoded sensors for ions (e.g. calcium) or membrane voltage. The effector in this system is light that has the advantage to operate with high spatial and temporal resolution at multiple wavelengths and locations”.</blockquote><p>Optogenetics research is proceeding. <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/post-trial-considerations-for-an-early-phase-optogenetic-trial-in-the--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OAJCT#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20there%20have%20been,the%20treatment%20of%20Retinitis%20Pigmentosa.&amp;text=Initial%20limited%20data%20released%20from,therapy%20treatment%20is%20well%20tolerated.">As of 2021</a>, there were four clinical trials involving optogenetics (on&nbsp;humans).</p><p>Optogenetics is promising for mass BCI because it’s less invasive than chip implants (injection vs surgery) and maybe more bandwidth (across the whole brain, yet fine-grained).</p><p>However, due to genetic manipulation and coaxing our brains to fire photons, many side effects are possible. For example, what if the brain fires too much and causes a seizure? Nonetheless, given ASI risk, research needs to proceed with even more urgency than before. It will need to get past a bike-shedding problem, as the next section elaborates.</p>Optogenetics (conceptual) 3.4.4 Invasive BCI regulation has a bike-shedding problem <p>None of the research on implants or optogenetics is (officially) aimed at healthy humans; it’s all for fixing human ailments.</p><p>Why? Because it’s already super-hard to get regulatory approval for human trials for the latter; going for the former has seemed unattainable.</p><p>Why? Put yourself in the shoes of a regulator. You’re used to balancing risk vs reward for a narrowly-scoped problem to fix a specific human medical ailment. You’re not used to balancing risk vs reward for a civilization-scoped issue, to avoid a non-medical existential risk for all Humanity. (Despite being the gatekeeper for&nbsp;that.)</p><p>So what do you do? You focus on what you know, and dismiss away the existential risk. This has a term: <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/bikeshedding">bike shedding</a>. When a safety committee for a nuclear power plants spends 95% of its time discussing the bike shed because they aren’t equipped to do anything about the big hairy nuclear risk&nbsp;issue.</p><p>BCI research is being bike-shedded right now. I’m hopeful that this will change as regulators and their higher-ups recognize the&nbsp;issue.</p> 3.4.5 What will tip invasive BCI into the mainstream? <p>Given the current regulatory constraints, how can invasive BCI accelerate into the mainstream? I see two main forces driving demand to make this happen: fixing ASI risk, and market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>ASI Risk. Ideally the regulators of large nations recognize the bike-shedding bias and reduce BCI restrictions, perhaps being super-aggressive to accelerate BCI via a “BCI Manhattan Project”. This could build on existing BCI-for-defense research like <a href="https://www.from-the-interface.com/DARPA-funding-BCI-research/">DARPA’s decades-long program</a>.</p><p>Smaller hungry nations may take the lead, for the $ and the PR. There’s $ and PR incentive to nations that loosen rules to meet market demand, such as Estonia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Residency_of_Estonia">E-residency</a>, China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen_Special_Economic_Zone">Shenzhen special economic zone</a>, and Singapore’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cryptocurrency_by_country_or_territory#Singapore">crypto regulations</a>. There’s a growing trickle in the medical domain. For starters, via the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/22/zuzalu-vitalik-buterin-led-retreat-in-montenegro-inspires-grants-for-zu-villages/">Zuzalu project</a>, Montenegro <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johncumbers/2023/05/12/could-montenegro-become-europes-first-longevity-state/">recently lightened</a> rules to catalyze longevity research. Most interestingly, Honduras already has very light rules for medical testing: <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">Bryan Johnson</a> recently leveraged it to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/21/bryan-johnson-human-guinea-pig-unproven-tests-reprogram-human-genes-follistatin-roatan-island-honduras/">get a novel gene therapy</a> there; there’s nothing stopping aggressive BCI testing in Honduras. Growing movements like <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">Network State</a> and <a href="https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Home">Blueprint</a> will further catalyze this jurisdictional arbitrage for invasive&nbsp;BCI.</p><p>Market forces. Consumers who start with non-invasive BCI will demand more performance, therefore more bandwidth, which means invasive BCI. Thus, there’ll be a bottom-up consumer push for invasive&nbsp;BCI.</p><p>When consumers see others using BCI for medical treatment that receive benefits far beyond getting healthy again, they’ll get particularly insistent.</p><p>People with the $ who are ready to accept the high risk and high reward will fly to Honduras for medical invasive-BCI tourism. Or they’ll build their own, just as Professor Xavier built Cerebro BCI in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)">X-Men</a>. Military BCI will leak into criminals and the black market, then into mainstream to satiate demand, like in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114558">Strange Days</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12590266">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>. Businesses will sprout up to get “medical BCI” in the hands of anyone who asks, like we saw for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-cannabis-california-20180420-story.html">medical marijuana in California</a>.</p><p>The $ and risk tolerance to get high-bandwidth BCI first will enjoy a significant advantage. This will raise legitimate questions about fairness. Ideally, cost and risk will come down quickly, to make it broadly accessible. Let’s&nbsp;see.</p>Left: Professor Xavier using Cerebro in X-Men. Middle: Spinal-implant BCI in Cyberpunk Edgerunners. 3.4.6 Mainstream invasive BCI will grow, a&nbsp;lot <p>We just covered how invasive BCI will tip into the mainstream. What happens next? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid">It’s the economics, silly</a>. There was great demand even before invasive BCI, despite limited bandwidth. Invasive BCI will unlock massive bandwidth, critically, to a market demanding it. So BCI growth rate will&nbsp;steepen.</p><p>The BCI market will merge with the <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/smartphone-market-100308">$500B</a> smartphone market, if it hadn’t already done it pre-invasive. iPhone 20 or 25 will be BCI-based, perhaps via a merge with Apple Vision Pro. Meta Quest 7 or 10 will get invasive BCI to complement eye-tracking and other non-invasive BCI. <a href="https://twitter.com/Shmojii/status/1722461353825210438">Neuralink will launch</a> their “phone”. Expect Samsung, Microsoft, OpenAI and others to get in the game too. A lot of $ is up for&nbsp;grabs.</p> Shmoji on Twitter: "whenever people ask Elon why none of his companies have made a phone yet, he responds "Neuralink"You wont need a phone / Twitter" <p>whenever people ask Elon why none of his companies have made a phone yet, he responds "Neuralink"You wont need a phone</p><p>What then? The devices will evolve and improve, subject to intense competition, one generation to the next, like smartphones did in the past 40+&nbsp;years.</p><p>Market forces and the Silicon Midas Touch drive performance. We’ll see 10x in bandwidth, which unlocks 10x+ more storage and compute. Then 100x in bandwidth, unlocking more storage and compute yet. Then, especially once we go semi-invasive/invasive with optogenetics or implanted chips, we’ll see 100x+ bandwidth, and corresponding 100x+ in storage and&nbsp;compute.</p><p>Moore’s Law, and AI improvements within BCI apps will further catalyze usefulness and demand. As a recent example, “<a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-mind-reading-braingpt-turns-thoughts-into-text-on-screen-72054">BrainGPT</a>” uses LLMs to interpret brain data for significant error reductions.</p> 3.4.7 Your BCI will be part of&nbsp;*you* <p>We are all <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/natural-born-cyborgs-9780195177510">natural born cyborgs</a>: when you ride a bike, it becomes part of you, as far as your brain is concerned. Same for keyboards.</p><p>The same will be true for&nbsp;BCI.</p><p>As far as your brain is concerned, your BCI — and the computers that you access — will be part of&nbsp;you.</p> 3.4.8 Hyper-localized AI Alignment <p>You’ll be a cyborg with a bio-stack meatbag brain and silicon-stack brain working in unison. This feels as natural as using a keyboard or a&nbsp;bicycle.</p><p>The compute &amp; storage of the silicon-stack will have its own AI-based automation, to abstract complexity from the bio-stack side. As its compute &amp; storage grows, we can expect <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Chaos-Order-Helix-Books/dp/0738201421">emergent intelligence</a> (in the John Holland sense). Then a concern arises: could the silicon stack AI take over the bio stack? The alignment problem rears its head here too! Fortunately, there’s a natural solution.</p><p>To maximize the chance that the silicon stack stays aligned with us, we ensure that processing or storage does not outpace bandwidth, at each evolutionary step along the way. This is no guarantee however: what if the silicon-side starts accessing way more compute from the internet?</p><p>This is different from traditional AI alignment approaches: here we are aligning the AI in real time, aligning it with our selves. It’s hyper-localized to each of us. It’s one aligned AI per human, rather than 1 or 10 for the human race. Therefore it’s 10 billion times more fine-grained and personalized. It’s AI alignment taken to the limit (in the calculus sense). There’s no guarantee that this will work. But it’s highly promising.</p> 3.5 The Journey to Human Superintelligence <p>This essay started with the ASI risk, and has shown a path to accelerate BCI and take it to the masses. The previous section showed how market- and risk-driven evolution took us to high-bandwidth BCIs. This section picks up from&nbsp;that.</p><p>At first, the silicon-stack brain’s power will be much weaker than the bio-stack one, bottlenecked by bandwidth. Then, we’ll increase bandwidth iteratively, with corresponding unlocks in compute and&nbsp;storage.</p><p>The silicon-stack side will get par with the bio-stack side.</p><p>Then it will start to surpass&nbsp;it.</p><p>We’ll keep going, as the market will demand it. [Rutt2024d]</p><p>The silicon-stack side will become radically more powerful than the bio-stack side.</p><p>And that will be fine with us! We’ll have gone through each BCI generation iteratively, vs being sprung on us all at once. Our worries will abate as the silicon-stack AI will be&nbsp;aligned.</p><p>In fact, the silicon-stack will feel like part of *you* as far as you’re concerned, because you’re a natural-born cyborg along with the rest of us. The emergent patterns of intelligence on the silicon-stack side will be wholly our&nbsp;own.</p><p>It will feel like the most natural thing in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Each of us will grow our compute &amp; storage by 10x, 100x, 1000x, more. The silicon-stack emergent patterns of intelligence — part of us — will grow 1000x too. Yet we will still be&nbsp;humans.</p><p>We will have grown to achieve human superintelligence.</p><p>There’s more. Let’s say you’ve got to 1000x storage &amp; compute, 1000x intelligence via the silicon-stack side of your self. Let’s say you’re now 90 years old and on your deathbed. Your bio-stack body and brain is&nbsp;dying.</p><p>Yet your bio-stack brain is now only 1/1000 the intelligence of the silicon-stack side. It’s probably been annoying you for a while, perhaps holding you back. And now it’s really holding you back, lying&nbsp;there.</p><p>What do you&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>You clip it like a fingernail.</blockquote><blockquote>And now you are on a pure silicon&nbsp;stack.</blockquote><p>There’s more. Consider the possibility that in 100 years (or 20) that the majority of intelligences will be on a silicon or post-silicon substrate. Some will have human origin, some will have pure AI origin, and some will have a mix. They will all be general; they will all be sovereign; they will all be superintelligent. They are Sovereign General Intelligences (SGIs).</p><p>What will the landscape look like? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos">Hyperion Cantos</a> provides inspiration. SGIs will inhabit the datumplane: “common ground for man, machine, and&nbsp;AI.”</p>The datumplane: common ground for man, machine and&nbsp;AI<p>So we have a path to unbound ourselves from biological constraints, while retaining our humanity. Which makes it a great time to ask. How big can you dream? What’s the biggest thing that civilization could possibly achieve? What do we want, as Humanity?</p><p>I mean Humanity in the broadest sense of the word: not just humans, but the multiple layers of civilization that encompass humans. Our thoughts and dreams, our patterns of intelligence, and how we want to self-actualize as a civilization.</p><p>As a baseline, we definitely know we don’t want to die, whether from asteroid strikes, nuclear holocaust or AIs terminating us all. “Not die” is a starting point. Accelerating BCI helps address all of those, because it allows us to easily be multi-planetary and be competitive with pure&nbsp;AIs.</p><p>“Not die” is an “away” viewpoint. Can we be more positive than that, with a “towards” perspective? Several steps more optimistic is: explore the cosmos, Star Trek style. That would be a grand adventure for Humanity on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>We can do better yet: let’s reshape the cosmos! Build Dyson Spheres to harness the power of stars directly — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev Scale</a> Type II. Reshape the cosmos at the scale of galaxies (Type III). Master energy at the level of the universe (<a href="https://futurism.com/the-kardashev-scale-type-i-ii-iii-iv-v-civilization">Type IV</a>). Even perhaps attain the knowledge to manipulate the universe at will (<a href="https://futurism.com/the-kardashev-scale-type-i-ii-iii-iv-v-civilization">Type V</a>). Now that would be an adventure for Humanity! Count me in&nbsp;[Kard].</p>A grand adventure for Humanity: explore and reshape the&nbsp;cosmos! 3.6 Cognitive Liberty <p>It’s one thing for the surveillance state or surveillance capitalism to monitor our electronic lives, as they do now. We’ve almost come to terms with it, whether we like it or not. But what about monitoring our thoughts? This will be a red line for most people, and rightly so. If our thoughts cannot be private, we risk freedom and personal sovereignty.</p><p>This is the concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_liberty">cognitive liberty</a>” or the “right to mental self-determination”: the freedom of an individual to control their own mental processes, cognition, and consciousness. I was happily surprised to discover a book-length exposé of the issue in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Your-Brain-Defending-Neurotechnology/dp/1250272955">The Battle for Your Brain: Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology</a>” by Nita A. Farahany.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q">Web3 framing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1283683204344545286">is</a>: “Your keys, your thoughts. Not your keys, not your thoughts”. Web3 points to a potential starting-point too: <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1283683204344545286">you hold your keys to your data</a>. And use infrastructure like <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">like Arweave to store</a> <a href="https://fil.org/">your brain data</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">Ocean Protocol to manage your brain data</a>. Appendix 5.1 elaborates. But this is only a partial solution; there will be many devilish challenges that need to be worked out. For example: if you hold the keys in your head, will the BCIs see those thoughts too? There’s dozens or thousands of man-years worth of R&amp;D needed&nbsp;here.</p><p>It’s hard to understate the importance of cognitive liberty. We need more work on this, asap. I’d love to see more funding to research efforts here, not to mention BCI-acceleration efforts in&nbsp;general.</p>In an age of BCI, how do we protect our thoughts and retain cognitive liberty? 4. Conclusion <p>ASI is coming, perhaps in 3–10 years. Humanity needs a competitive substrate, in time for this. BCI is the most pragmatic path. Therefore, we need to accelerate BCI and take it to the masses. That is&nbsp;bci/acc.</p><p>The “masses-first” bci/acc variant is to bring non-invasive BCI with killer apps like silent messaging to healthy people first; then to use market momentum to get over the invasive-BCI hump; and finally, to keep growing the power of each human’s bio-stack and silicon-stack brains. Looping this repeatedly, the net result is human superintelligence (HSI).</p><p>In perhaps 100 years (or 20) the majority of intelligences will be on a silicon or post-silicon substrate. Some will have human origin, some will have pure AI origin, and some will have a mix. They will all be general; they will all be sovereign; they will all be superintelligent: they are Sovereign General Intelligences (SGIs). They’ll be reshaping and exploring the cosmos, climbing the Kardashev scales.</p><p>bci/acc is solarpunk: optimistic and perhaps a little gonzo. It’s e/acc zoomed-in for BCI. And it could be a grand adventure for Humanity.</p> 5. Appendices  5.1 Appendix: Sovereign Web3&nbsp;Software <p>This section describes how many state-of-the-art Web3 systems are already sovereign — beholden to no one — and how Web3 capabilities will keep expanding for powerful sovereign agents.</p><p>Decentralized Elements of Computing. A blockchain is a network of machines (nodes) that maintains a list of transactions. It’s decentralized: no single entity owns or controls the network. With a decentralized list of transactions, we can then <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/blockchain-infrastructure-landscape-a-first-principles-framing-92cc5549bafe">decentralize the elements of computing</a>: storage, compute, and communications. “Web3” is a more accessible term than “blockchain”, but they basically mean the same&nbsp;thing.</p>  Storage of Value. In blockchains, storage comes in two parts: storage of value, and storage of data. We already have a wonderful decentralized store of value, ie “digital gold”: Bitcoin which stores BTC tokens. Released in 2009, it has a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">market cap</a> &gt; $700B and <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/cryptocurrency/how-many-people-use-bitcoin">tens of millions</a> of users. Just as Bitcoin has BTC as its native token, Ethereum has ETH, and so on; each are stores of value. Finally, there are tokens as decentralized scripts on top of a chain (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC20</a>).  Storage of Data. Smallish amounts of data can live on a chain itself; that’s how value is stored. We also have larger-scale decentralized data storage: <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> and <a href="https://fil.org/">Filecoin</a> are the leading projects. We have decentralized access control to that data via <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, and decentralized data feeds via <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> [LINK].  Compute (Processing). The first really great decentralized compute system was <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> which came out in 2015. It runs smart contracts, which are simply small scripts running on decentralized compute hardware. It’s pretty expensive to do compute directly on Ethereum smart contracts, so there are ways that it’s scaling up. These include (a) more powerful “Layer 1” chains like <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, (b) “Layer 2” chains, especially “<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/">Zero-Knowledge Rollup</a>” L2s which enable compute to be off-chain with provable compute results stored on-chain, and (c ) decentralized compute markets like <a href="https://iex.ec/">iExec</a> and <a href="https://www.golem.network/">Golem</a>, and many more recent ones including AI-specialized ones.  Communications. Being decentralized networks, all blockchains have an element of communications built in. And, there are multi-chain protocols like <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> or <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>, and cross-chain protocols like <a href="https://thorchain.org/">THORchain</a>, <a href="https://chain.link/cross-chain">CCIP</a>, and <a href="https://chainflip.io/">Chainflip</a>.  <p>Smart Contracts &amp; Chains are Sovereign. Perhaps surprisingly, every smart contract running on a chain is sovereign 🤯 [Gov]. For example, Uniswap V2 is a popular decentralized exchange. Each Uniswap pool — say ETH/USDT — has its own smart contract. Each of those pools is a robot that just “does its thing”: holding liquidity, giving some USDT for people who bring it ETH, and giving some ETH for people who bring it USDT. There are no humans helping it, it “just runs”, you can’t turn it off, it’s not beholden to any specific individual, organization or jurisdiction. It is sovereign.</p><p>Each chain is sovereign too. Each chain is beholden to no one. It’s why <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/bitcoin-new-form-of-life-d7a6ee0985f4">Bitcoin can be framed as a life&nbsp;form</a>.</p><p>These sovereign smart contracts and chains can do all the usual things: store &amp; manage wealth, store &amp; manage data, do compute, and communicate. Uniswap and Bitcoin answer to no&nbsp;one.</p><p>And, they have rights! While no one lobbied for these robots’ rights, and no law was created for these robots’ rights, they have rights nonetheless, because they can manipulate resources without asking. How? because the technology itself allows for it: <a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">it’s a dry code, not wet code</a> approach to rights. It’s “y<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q">our keys,</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">your Bitcoin</a>” <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">for robots themselves</a>. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/defining-the-metaverse-the-new-internet-experience-built-by-gamers">Do you get it yet&nbsp;anon</a>?</p><p>AI &amp; Agents for Web3. So far, chain-based robots haven’t been very smart. But this is changing as Web3 capabilities grow. Some examples:</p>  <a href="https://www.explainablestartup.com/2017/06/why-prediction-is-the-essence-of-intelligence.html">Prediction is the essence of intelligence</a>. <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> is a recent system for prediction feeds, powered by AI prediction bots and consumed by AI trading bots. The feeds themselves are sovereign; the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/meet-predictoor-accountable-accurate-prediction-feeds-8b104d26a5d9#5039">bots can be&nbsp;too</a>.  <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a> and <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> are Web3 systems to run decentralized agents (bots). These agents can be sovereign: no one owns or controls.  <p>The above AI * Web3 projects are by OGs in both AI &amp; Web3. Advances in Web3 storage, processing, and communication have helped their capabilities. And the recent explosion in AI interest has brought a large new wave of AI * Web3 projects.</p> 5.2 Appendix: AI Alignment Bingo <p>In 2022, Rob Bensinger <a href="https://twitter.com/robbensinger/status/1503220020175769602">tweeted</a> the following text and image. It’s become a useful (and hilarious) reference in many AI &amp; alignment crowds.</p><blockquote>“Bad take” bingo cards are terrible, because they never actually say what’s wrong with any of the arguments they’re making fun of. So here’s the “bad AI alignment take bingo” meme that’s been going around… but with actual responses to the “bad&nbsp;takes”!</blockquote> 5.3 Appendix: Issues on ASI Risk Idea “dumber AIs aligning smarter&nbsp;ones” <p>This is the approach <a href="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization">published by OpenAI</a> in December 2023. The idea is to have a chain of AIs from dumb → smart, where each link is a dumber AI aligning the next-smarter AI.</p><p>Here, we elaborate on the&nbsp;issues.</p>  “Chain risk” framing. Each link needs to have crazy-high reliability, which likely isn’t achievable. Probability of failure = 1–(probability of failure of link 1, pfail 1) * (pfail 2) * (pfail 3) *&nbsp;… * (pfail n) * (probability of failure of non-link components); assuming independent pfails. E.g. if there are 5 links in the chain and perfect reliability for non-link components, and you want &lt;1% chance of failure, then each link must have &lt;1e-5 (0.001%) chance of&nbsp;failure.  “Over-leverage risk” framing. This can be seen as over-leverage risk too. The 2008 financial crisis illustrates how over-leverage can go badly wrong. In 2008, there was a chain of derivatives on housing mortgages like Credit Default Swaps, which amplified billions into tens of trillions: home mortgage → 10x derivative → 100x derivative → 1000x derivative. Any fluctuation in home mortgages, such as slight changes to interest rates, rippled to 1000x effects downstream.  Smartest entity might disagree. Rhetorically, could an ant align a bee → align a mouse → dog → align a chimpanzee → align a human? If you’re the human, would you let this&nbsp;happen?  Smartest entity could change rules of weaker layers. It’s the smartest entity not just disagreeing, but actively pushing the other layers to its own benefit. In the 2008 financial crisis, to make more $, the bankers at the top (final link) were highly incentivized to grow the $ volume of mortgages (first link). This resulted in craziness. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/why-didnt-we-sink-into-a-depression-after-lehman/article13997133/">For example</a>, a strawberry picker husband &amp; wife with &lt; $15,000 combined annual income obtained a loan for a $720,000 house, with no money down. They had no hope of paying back the loan; the chain couldn’t last; the chain broke; the 2008 financial meltdown happened.  <p>To summarize, solving ASI risk with a chain of AIs has great risk on its&nbsp;own.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thank you very much to the following people for review, discussion, and feedback on these ideas and this essay in particular: <a href="https://twitter.com/jim_rutt">Jim Rutt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/meadovian">Mark Meadows</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">Albert Wenger</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/louviq">Lou de Kerhuelvez</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffwilser">Jeff Wilser</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kalinh">Kalin Harvey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrucePon">Bruce Pon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fractastical">Joel Dietz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/solderneer">Shan Sundaramahalingam</a>, and <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-a-sim-00575066">Jeremy&nbsp;Sim</a>.</p><p>And, thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/meadovian">Mark Meadows</a> for the opportunity to share the ideas with NASA, and <a href="https://twitter.com/louviq">Lou de Kerhuelvez</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/allisondman">Allison Duettman</a> for the opportunity to share with Foresight Institute. Finally, thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos">e/acc movement</a> for the courage and optimism. (And for inspiration of “bci/acc” label, it’s an improvement on “<a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/the-bandwidth-scenario-d3bfd8f29e2d">Bandwidth++</a>”).</p> Notes <p>[Spec1999] The fair was <a href="https://spectrum.usask.ca/">Spectrum</a> 1999, held every four years at the University of Saskatchewan’s College of Engineering. Some people skied no better than random; others had 0% error. This was a useful lesson on the high variability among people in BCI accuracy. I found the same thing in experiments on other BCI devices&nbsp;too.</p><p>[Tsh2012] The researchers’ tricks included: more sensors, active not passive sensing (visual evoked potentials), maximize rate of neural firing, error correction codes, and&nbsp;AI</p><p>[Rutt2024a] Thanks to Jim Rutt for this specific framing. To expand on Jim’s words, lightly edited: “it’s not just 1000x more powerful but qualitatively different. The ASI could actually deeply understand in total detail even the most complex book. That’s very different from how humans create a rough highly compressed representation. Human memories are faulty and low fidelity; machines are not. Clock speed is 1 ms (1e-3 s) for neurons, and sub-nanoseconds (&lt;1e-9 s) for chips. Today meat minds have a huge advantage in parallelization, but that will eventually be solved in silicon.”</p><p>[Hyp1989] Many sci-fi novels explore potential relations between humans and ASIs, where they act as gods to humans. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos">Hyperion Cantos</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep">A Fire Upon the Deep</a> are two prominent examples; there are&nbsp;more.</p><p>[Verd2023] “Guillaume Verdon: Beff Jezos, E/acc Movement, Physics, Computation &amp; AGI”, Lex Fridman Podcast #407, Dec 29, 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fEEbKJoNbU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fEEbKJoNbU</a></p><p>The e/acc movement has a second argument&nbsp;: the general idea of deceleration runs against the physics tendency of entropy to shrink over time. On earth, this manifests as evolution in biology (ability to acquire resources and reproduce), and as evolution in human organization (ability to acquire resources and reproduce — capitalism). Even in the highly-unlikely event somehow all the above deceleration efforts were successful, in the medium term, entropy and evolution will route around these&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>[Snow2013] Remember, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet">Edward Snowden’s 2013</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/1">revelations</a> didn’t stop the goals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a> surveillance. Now, USA and its allies simply get the data <a href="https://www.privacyjournal.net/edward-snowden-nsa-prism/">via big tech companies</a> vs. directly.</p><p>[Weng2023] From private conversation with Albert Wenger in late 2023, soon to be&nbsp;public.</p><p>[Goer2013] This is an oft-repeated example by Ben Goertzel, from <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929260-300-to-create-a-robot-with-common-sense-mimic-a-toddler/">2013</a> and likely&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>[Rutt2024b] Thanks to Jim Rutt for this idea, and inspiration for the wording. (Private correspondence.)</p><p>[Rutt2024c] Thanks to Jim Rutt to help develop this&nbsp;idea.</p><p>[BciTech] These include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy">fNIRS</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> (fMRI), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_stimulation">transcranial stimulation</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation">TMS</a> (magnetic) and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00549/full">tFUS</a> (focused ultrasound), and more. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. bci/acc may use any of these. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2799839">Endovascular BCI</a> has a particularly promising tradeoff of minimally-invasive yet high-signal.</p><p>[Rutt2024d] A great question from Jim Rutt, lightly edited: “While the market is an excellent hill climber, there is no guarantee at all that it finds global maxima. Maybe there ought to be a political/social layer. Is this what humanity&nbsp;wants?”</p><p>[Kard] Once bci/acc unbounds humanity 100% from biological constraints, the “bci” part is less important. bci/acc generalizes back into e/acc. These Kardashev-scale goals are 100% in-line with the goals of&nbsp;e/acc.</p><p>Also: If we were bound by our bio stack, there would have been a hitch. The nearest star beyond our sun is Proxima Centauri. It takes 4.3 years to get there if you’re traveling at light speed. OK, doable. However, if you travel at Voyager speed — the man-made device that’s gone the fastest in space so far — it will take 73,000 years. That’s a time scale 10x larger than the time since the Greeks. Less practically doable. As sci-fi author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross">Charlie Stross</a> has said “<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=rpKKbEzJpj8C&amp;pg=PT63&amp;lpg=PT63&amp;dq=sending+canned+primates+was+never+going+to+end+happily&amp;ots=vU7Sacw3iz&amp;sig=-az97pv_0k80t8T7i3TrW5Dhgiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7mpvgzdPWAhWGAxoKHaxsAxEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sending%20canned%20primates%20was%20never%20going%20to%20end%20happily&amp;f=false">Sending canned primates was never going to end happily</a>”. Good thing we’ve unbound ourselves from our bio&nbsp;stack!</p><p>[LINK] Chainlink got its start doing decentralized data feeds. As it’s grown, its scope has expanded to much&nbsp;more.</p><p>[Gov] Assuming no governance, which is true for a lot of smart contracts. Uniswap V2 has no governance, though V3&nbsp;does.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/bci-acc-a-path-to-balance-ai-superintelligence-80bb6f32e39c">bci/acc: A Path to Balance AI Superintelligence</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Name: Jacob Healy<br>Team: Product Delivery<br>Based in:&nbsp;Arvada, Colorado   About Jacob <p>My journey began with math and being interested in problems, but no problem in particular.&nbsp; I was fortunate to find a great company solving important problems early in my career, where I could dive into development and IT implementation for government agencies.&nbsp; That led to managing large-scale software implementations, where I landed on the particular problem of just how to get complex things done - process development and building strong teams. </p><p>I eventually decided to move on to SpruceID as the Product Delivery Lead because I think that digital identity is a particular problem that needs to be solved, and SpruceID is able to do it, do it right, and affords me the opportunity to contribute significantly and quickly to that goal.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>At SpruceID, I tackle the gap between “we should do this” and “we did this.” As the one ultimately accountable for the success of project execution across the organization, I have the opportunity to wear many hats, the privilege of working closely with everyone in the organization, and the honor of collaborating directly with and delivering value to all of our clients.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your role? <p>The most rewarding aspect of my role is seeing the tangible impact of our work on government agencies and, ultimately, the public. Implementing innovative digital credentialing solutions that streamline processes and enhance security gives me a great sense of accomplishment. Additionally, building, leading, and collaborating with a high-performing team that consistently delivers successful outcomes is incredibly fulfilling.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Adaptability, a steady hand, and the ability to learn quickly and hold context.&nbsp; Seeing the forest through the trees is critical for overall success. It's important to navigate complex projects, engage effectively with diverse stakeholders, and make informed decisions that balance various priorities, often in real-time. Being able to hold the line and understand both technical and business aspects is essential.&nbsp;</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>It feels like everything, all the time. There is always something new in the digital identity space but being in such a fast moving startup keeps me on my toes in all ways.&nbsp; I learn something new everyday from my colleagues and partners about scaling teams, processes, and tech.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>There have been many, but one that stands out was kicking off our work with the State of Utah. It was really fun to go to Salt Lake City and meet with some great technologists, talk about verifiable digital credentials, and explore how the Department of Natural Resources could use them for off-highway Vehicle Permits. And then seeing it all launch later, of course.&nbsp;</p> What's the best piece of advice you’ve received since starting here? <p>The best piece of advice I've received since starting at SpruceID is to embrace a growth mindset.&nbsp; The special twist, or magnification, a startup has on this has given me a new point of view.&nbsp; I've learned that viewing challenges as opportunities to learn rather than obstacles encourages innovation and resilience. This perspective has empowered me to tackle complex projects with confidence and to continuously develop both personally and professionally.</p> What is some advice that you’d give to someone in your role who is early in their career? <p>Embrace continuous learning and remain adaptable. The technology landscape is always evolving, so staying curious will help you navigate changes effectively. Building strong relationships with your team and stakeholders is also key to successful project delivery.&nbsp; Maybe more than anything though, pay attention.&nbsp; You never know when that random conversation or piece of information will be the exact thing you need.&nbsp; Good enough and great outcomes are often separated by Slumdog Millionaire Moments.&nbsp;</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>The easy answer here is to make sure we meet the objective, have the impact we intended, and take into account our strategic goals.&nbsp; I like to add some qualifiers, though, the ends do not always justify the means.&nbsp; How does the team feel? How does the client feel? Did we do right by the customer and ourselves?&nbsp; If yes, then success.&nbsp;</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?: Raising my kids, trying to make the most of every minute.</p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?): My favorite coding language is whatever gets the job done when and how it needs to be done. I defer this to the wiser, more engineering-focused minds.&nbsp;</p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: If I could be any tree, I would be an Ent (from the world of Tolkien). Ents are wise guardians of the forest—embodying strength, resilience, and a deep sense of responsibility. They are not just passive observers; they take action to protect what they care about. Similarly, I strive to be as thoughtful of a leader as I can, who actively works to safeguard and nurture the people I work with and projectsI work on, pursuing growth and harmony.</p><p>Interested in joining our team?

 Overview <p>The 2024 Mexico Grand Prix Prediction Challenge invites participants to build machine learning models that predict vital aspects of Formula 1 pit stop strategies. Using historical data from the 2018–2023 Mexico Grand Prix and race data from the 2024 season, participants will analyze variables such as lap times, stint numbers, tire compounds, and pit stop timing. Participants are also encouraged to use their own data sources and pre-race variables such as weather conditions, track temperature, or any other relevant factors they deem important. Accurate predictions of stints, tire compounds, and average lap times are essential for&nbsp;success.</p><p>Time-series data, like lap times and sector splits, combined with categorical data (e.g., tire compounds: Soft, Medium, Hard), will help participants build models that predict key elements of pit stop strategies. Models must account for various race conditions, with evaluation based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for lap time and tire compound predictions.</p> Objectives <p>The goal is to develop machine learning models to predict the number of stints, tire compounds for each stint, laps per stint, and average lap times. Participants will leverage both the provided datasets and any additional data sources they choose to incorporate, such as pre-race weather, track temperature, other relevant factors, and historical race information and race-specific conditions.</p><p>The models should handle varying race strategies that evolve due to factors like tire degradation, weather changes, or safety car interventions. Evaluation will focus on the accuracy of predictions, with the Ocean team testing the models post-race to assess their performance.</p> Data <p>Participants will have access to two primary datasets: historical race data from the 2018–2023 Mexico Grand Prix and race data from the 2024 season. These datasets include over 30 variables: lap times, stint numbers, tire compounds, pit stop timings, and driver positions. In addition, participants may use their own data sources and incorporate pre-race variables, including weather forecasts, track temperature, or any other external data relevant to the&nbsp;race.</p><p>The dataset includes continuous variables like lap times and sector splits, as well as categorical variables like tire compounds and stint numbers. The data allows models to study pit stop strategies and performance over time, improving robustness and generalization across different race conditions and strategies.</p> Mission <p>The mission is to develop machine learning models that accurately predict pit stop strategies, including the number of stints, tire compounds for each stint, laps per stint, and average lap times. Predictions will be based on pre-race data such as starting grid positions, weather forecasts, track temperature, and historical race data from previous Mexico Grand Prix&nbsp;events.</p><p>Flexibility and adaptability to race dynamics — like tire degradation, changing weather, and unforeseen race events — are key. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and demonstrate the ability to generalize predictions across varying race conditions and scenarios.</p> Rewards <p>The $10,000 prize pool will be distributed among the top 10 performers:</p>Prize pool rewards and point distribution<p>Participants will also earn points toward the 2024 championship. Accumulating points correlates with increased rewards, as seen in the 2023 Championship, where top performers received an additional $10 for each point earned throughout the&nbsp;year.</p> Opportunities <p>This challenge is not just about winning rewards, and it’s about enhancing your skills in advanced data science techniques such as regression analysis, time series modeling, and classification algorithms. By applying these techniques to real-world Formula 1 data, you’ll learn how to analyze complex datasets, predict pit stop strategies, and derive actionable insights that inform competitive decision-making. This experience will prepare you for roles in sports analytics and other data-driven industries, equipping you with practical expertise in race strategy analysis.</p> How to Participate <p>Are you ready to join us on this quest?

Nature Provides the Solution: Tackling Heat with Green&nbsp;Cities <p>As our cities swell and concrete stretches wider, the threats of heatwaves grow, increasingly cornering us into sweltering urban jungles. Imagine this: over 30% of the global population now faces deadly heat extremes for nearly a month each year. In Seoul alone, a study highlighted a staggering 8.4% spike in mortality rates during such sweltering times. In the UK, the summer 2022 heat periods were associated with 2,985 deaths in England alone. The risks are especially severe for the most vulnerable among us — women, the elderly, and those without the financial means to create internal thermal&nbsp;comfort.</p><p>But what if our cities could breathe and cool themselves naturally? Urban parks, green roofs, and tree-lined streets are nature’s air conditioners, significantly reducing urban heat. These aren’t just oases of cool; they’re our frontline defence. They shade our pavements, lower surrounding temperatures, and purify our air, making our urban spaces not just bearable, but liveable.</p>Image Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/raedmansour/">Raed&nbsp;Mansour</a><p>This builds off our work to date, developing the LBS platform (see the next section), building functionality so the tool is not for not just analysing, but managing risks by empowering citizens via generative AI. Alongside Vaiv, we are partnering with the Information Systems Intelligence Lab at Yonsei University, a smart city and living lab demonstration that explores how to address social issues with open civic participatory methodologies.</p> 2. Risk analysis: Location-Based Scoring in Songpa District in&nbsp;Seoul Image 1. Cause-effect relationships among risk components like hazard, exposure, and vulnerability<p>To enhance decision-making capabilities, the Trees AI team at Dark Matter Labs is supporting municipalities to perform risk-based vulnerability assessments — what we call Location-Based Scoring (LBS). We have implemented this in Songpa, Seoul. By streamlining various remote, weather, institutional, and citizen sensing data, the LBS data modelling framework sets up a comparative spatial assessment of the level of risks from heat island effect in citizen health and wellbeing. For a more detailed exploration of the LBS methodology, check out our related work in Stuttgart: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/treesai-is-implementing-location-based-scoring-in-stuttgart-c54c752bdaaf">TreesAI is implementing location-based scoring in Stuttgart</a>.</p>Image 2. Input data aggregated via a geometric weighted mean to generate heat risk&nbsp;index<p>Songpa District in Seoul, South Korea, was selected for its high population density and varied urban fabric, presenting an ideal setting to study and tackle the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE). The detailed analysis is enabled by a high spatial resolution of 100x100 metres, essential for crafting effective hyper-local climate adaptation strategies. However, the absence of street-level demographic data, particularly concerning age and income, poses challenges in precisely assessing vulnerability and pinpointing areas where the most at-risk populations are exposed to extreme&nbsp;heat.</p><p>LBS was then paired with the Green Urban Scenarios (GUS) framework which explores the potential of urban greenery for cooling. For more information check out <a href="https://lucidmindsai.medium.com/gus-in-action-quantifying-cooling-effect-of-trees-23a59a75fe60">How VAIV uses GUS in Seoul</a>. The combination of these two tools had provided VAIV with a data framework that not only models the effects of different tree canopy scenarios but also identifies vulnerable areas to heat risk that would benefit the most from a NBS adaptation strategy.</p>Image 2. GIF to show the cooling potential of canopy growth over a period of 10 years. Results were computed thanks to our partners LucidMinds AI using the Green Unified Scenarios (GUS)&nbsp;tool. What we&nbsp;learnt <p>A significant challenge to cities making data-enabled decisions, is the comprehensive collection and integration of relevant data — spanning environmental, physical, and crucially, social dynamics. Understanding community values ensures that digital twins reflect real-life scenarios, making their insights more actionable. Beyond gathering data, transforming these into meaningful insights and actions poses another layer of complexity. This includes harnessing sociocultural data to assess resilience and coping mechanisms, essential for risk management.</p><p>Following this, we will be exploring how more localised data inputs from citizen surveys, digital engagement, and AI-driven analysis of social media, will enhance our narrative on risk indicators as part of the heat-sensing project.</p> 3. Driving Adaptation: Recommending Actions <p>Our aim at TreesAI is not to just analyse risks but to actively manage them by empowering citizens and city officials with the tools for tailored adaptation plans and effective crisis management.</p><p>While our data-driven risk assessment and digital twin modelling in Songpa underscored the potential for urban green infrastructure, we encountered a significant challenge: the scarcity of available land for large-scale nature-based solutions (NBS). The most heat-vulnerable areas are also the most densely populated, with limited space for expansive green projects. This paradox highlights a critical need for innovative, space-efficient strategies that integrate nature into the urban fabric without requiring large tracts of&nbsp;land.</p><p>To move from analysis to feasible NbS recommendations, during the Heat-sensing project we will be developing a framework to match heat adaptation actions to different urban landscapes. For example, in high-rise residential areas, community gardens and tree planting initiatives that knit communities closer together while providing thermal comfort may be key. Whereas in industrial zones, installing cool roofs and permeable pavements can curb heat accumulation and manage water runoff. Mixed-use centres gain from pocket parks and shaded walkways, while commercial zones can benefit from green roofs and tree-lined avenues.</p><p>It is also important to note that the impact of NbS often spreads well beyond its boundaries — for exempla rural <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/rural-buffer-ring-can-reduce-urban-heat-island-effect-by-more-than-0-5c/">buffer rings have been shown to reduce UHI</a>E. Addressing the relationship between the resolution of heat risk assessments and the granularity of actionable measures is crucial. Higher resolution data allows for more precise risk assessments, but the corresponding actions may be implemented at a broader scale, influencing the scope and design of adaptation scenarios. This disparity necessitates careful consideration in scenario planning to ensure that strategies are both effective and feasible, reflecting the detailed insights gained from high-resolution assessments while accommodating the broader scale of implementation.</p><p>See the table below for initial analysis of which NbS to recommend in which&nbsp;context.</p> 4. Where next: the Heat-Sensing Project <p><a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/getting-locally-led-adaptation-right-examples-around-world">Local people and organizations who are most directly affected by — and often disproportionately vulnerable to — the impacts of climate change are often left out of critical decision-making processes to address them, such as the design of adaptation programs or plans…. Smaller, local organizations and communities get boxed out, unable to access the funding and other resources they need to recover and build resiliency to floods, droughts, heat waves and myriad other impacts of climate&nbsp;change.</a></p><p>We believe that climate change is a collective problem, with these tools requiring a people-centred approach that drives action. During the Heat-sensing project we will therefore be exploring two main avenues of research and development.</p>  Localising a risk based vulnerability assessment (LBS) framework to focus on what matters most to people: we are exploring a data framework that streamlines various remote, weather, institutional, and citizen stories and sensing to assess the climate risks of heat island effects in cities and support the creation of community engagement strategies.  Deploying Assistive AI and civic participatory tools to drive action: we will use generative AI to run different adaptation and mitigation scenarios from individual to institutional levels to assess the potential cooling effect of a broad spectrum of interventions — providing easy-to-understand personalised recommendations.   Much of the work will be about talking to stakeholders, so whether you are a city planner or a concerned citizen, please don’t hesitate to get in touch at treesai@darkmatterlabs.org  About the&nbsp;partners <p>At Dark Matter Labs, we view the interconnected crises of our time as symptoms of a deeper, structural miscoding of our economic systems. We understand these codes to be physical (e.g. biodiversity, energy, labour and materials), structural (e.g. money creation, embedded inequality and private property rights) and psychological (e.g. failure of the imagination).</p><p>Recognising the complex, entangled reality of living systems, we are exploring alternative pathways for organising society and stewarding the shared planetary commons. Our working hypothesis is that these pathways must be rooted in a radical reframing of our relationship to everything; from technology and money to land and the other-than-human world.

<p>This is the second article in a series of technical posts about how Track &amp; Trust works at a component level. Building on your understanding of our <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-technical-deep-dive-mesh-network-technology/">mesh network technology</a>, this post asks the question – what if everything starts going wrong? The answer as you will see lies in our Satellite-enabled Mesh Network nodes. Quick navigation links to the follow-up articles will be provided at the bottom of each article once the series is complete. For now, let’s jump in.</p>
<p>The mesh network technology alone can’t get the job done. To make it work, we want the Track &amp; Trust logistics tracking and communication to function even in the most challenging circumstances. However, addressing a few more challenges is necessary to achieve this. Additionally, we need to consider the limitations of the technology.</p>
 The Challenges 
<p>What if 4G doesn’t work at all? Remote logistics operations or external circumstances like war or political instability can cause this issue. In such cases, tracking becomes a challenge, especially when the electrical power is unreliable. Consequently, we need to find alternative solutions.</p>
<p>We spent quite some time solving these issues. Fortunately, we did indeed find a way. With funding from the <a href="https://www.esa.int/">European Space Agency</a>, we built a Satellite-enabled Mesh Network. Some mesh nodes now have more super powers, enabling them to do everything they could before, and more. Moreover, these special satellite-enabled mesh nodes are more expensive, but they have a special trick up their sleeves. They can post data to our servers even without 4G internet. Here’s how it works.</p>
 Satellite-Enabled Mesh Nodes 
<p></p>
<p>The yellow box in the picture represents a satellite enabled mesh node. By adding an<a href="https://www.iridium.com/services/iridium-sbd/"> Iridium short burst data (SBD)</a> transmitter to it, we gave it superpowers. Connecting this node to a mesh node via waterproof cables turns it into a super node. Our partners at <a href="https://ororatech.com/">OroraTech</a> built this part of the system. Data arrives at this node using peer to peer communication over wifi-direct. The Iridium short burst data (SBD) Transmitter consumes information from <a href="https://medium.com/weaver-labs/cellmesh-redefining-connectivity-in-crisis-and-supply-chains-7f10218ea238">cellmesh</a>, finding out what data didn’t get posted to the internet via 4g.</p>
<p>To make this work, a clear view of the sky is necessary. That’s why we waterproofed the enclosures. Strategic placement of these nodes is crucial. A good position is one where many other nodes will pass by, and it should also have a relatively solid electrical power supply. In our pilot, the roof of a local school with a solar power installation already in place proved to be an ideal location. Furthermore, this location allowed us to test the system in a real-world setting.</p>
<p>Breaking down each data package into smaller packages is essential. These packages must be small enough to send over Iridium short burst data. As a result, each user action results in 8-9 individual satellite messages. These messages are encoded and transmitted individually, error checked, and then recombined. Finally, they can post to our backend systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in real life – a shot from our labs. In addition to the technical details, we will also cover the practical applications of the system.</p>
 What about electrical outages? 
<p>We anticipated that the nodes would need to be robust. Ensuring they have enough on-board power was crucial. This compensates for electrical outages, as delivery trucks can only supply 12v power when the ignition is on.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our hardware engineer friends at <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a> provided a solid solution to this issue inside these boxes. They equipped the nodes with integrated backup power systems and implemented a battery management system and software. This helps the nodes recover from power outages and situations where the on-board battery is fully depleted. Moreover, this ensures that the system remains operational even in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>The result is a combination of hardware and software, enabled by mesh network technology, 4g, and satellite communication. This combination allows the system to stand up to difficult conditions and still work. In conclusion, our system is designed to provide reliable tracking and communication in even the most challenging environments.</p>
<p>In our next post, I’ll address how the system handles security, covering the authentication and blockchain details backed into Track &amp; Trust.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>Organizations and society have become dependent upon digital services which has increased the impact of cyber threats on businesses and the general public.&nbsp; Recent incidents demonstrate how <a href="https://www.bl.uk/home/british-library-cyber-incident-review-8-march-2024.pdf/">ransomware attacks</a> and even <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/crowdstrikes-cyber-blackout">mistakes</a> can <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2024/06/14/update-on-cyber-incident-clinical-impact-in-south-east-london-friday-14-june-2024/">disrupt public services including healthcare</a>. You need to prepare for and implement these regulations effectively, not only to meet your obligations, but also to protect your organization.</p>
 NIS2 and DORA scope and regulatory approach 
<p>The EU NIS2 (Network and Information Security Directive 2) and the EU DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) are two regulatory frameworks designed to enhance the cybersecurity and operational resilience of organizations within the European Union. Although they have overlapping goals in promoting robust cybersecurity practices, they differ in their scope, objectives, and target sectors.</p>
<p>NIS2 has a broader scope and applies to multiple sectors beyond finance, including healthcare, transport, energy, digital infrastructure, and public administration. It aims to enhance cybersecurity across a diverse range of critical sectors.&nbsp; On the other hand, DORA focusses exclusively on the financial industry. It addresses how financial entities, and their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) providers should handle operational resilience and cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p>NIS2 takes a principles-based approach, offering guidelines that can be adapted by different sectors. It establishes minimum requirements and allows individual member states to implement additional rules if needed.&nbsp; DORA, however, takes a more prescriptive approach, with detailed rules and requirements for financial entities. It defines clear guidelines for risk management, incident reporting, testing, and monitoring of third-party ICT providers.</p>
 Third-Party Risk Management 
<p>Both emphasize the importance of organizations managing risks in their cyber supply chains. DORA places a strong emphasis on third-party risk management within the financial sector, introducing stricter oversight of ICT service providers. It requires financial institutions to monitor and manage risks arising from third-party ICT dependencies, with critical ICT providers being subject to direct regulatory oversight. On the other hand, NIS2 encourages managing supply chain risks but does not impose as strict controls over third-party service providers as DORA.</p>
 NIS2 and the British Library Hack 
<p>In October 2023, the British Library was the victim of a cyber-attack which copied and exfiltrated some 600GB of files, including personal data of library users and staff. As well as the exfiltration of data for ransom, the attackers’ methods included the encryption of data and systems, and the destruction of some servers to inhibit system recovery and to cover their tracks.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider how this incident could have been prevented or its impact significantly reduced by compliance with the NIS2 Directive.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions based on comparing the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/home/british-library-cyber-incident-review-8-march-2024.pdf/">reported results of the investigation</a> into the incident with the requirements of NIS2.</p>
<p>Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The lack of MFA on certain systems allowed unauthorized access, which was a significant factor in the attack's success. NIS2 emphasizes the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, including MFA, to protect network and information systems. Had MFA been in place across all remote and privileged access points, it would have added a critical layer of security and could have prevented the attackers from gaining access as easily.</p>
<p>Improved Network Segmentation and Monitoring. The library's legacy network infrastructure allowed attackers broader access once they breached the system. NIS2 mandates that organizations employ risk management practices, including network segmentation and continuous monitoring, to limit the spread of potential breaches. Implementing a modern, segmented network design as required by NIS2 could have restricted the attackers’ movement, minimizing the impact.</p>
<p>Regular Security Assessments and Testing.&nbsp; Although the Library had conducted some security assessments, the NIS2 Directive encourages regular and more comprehensive security testing, such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. These assessments could have highlighted weaknesses, particularly in legacy systems, and prompted remedial actions that might have prevented the attack.</p>
 Your Weakness is their Opportunity 
<p>The UK telecoms and services provider <a href="https://newsroom.bt.com/bt-spots-2000-signals-of-potential-cyber-attacks-every-second-as-tvs-hunted-star-warns-of-ai-arms-race/">BT logs 2,000 signals of potential cyber-attacks</a> every second; 200 million per day.&nbsp; According to IBM the average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.88 million.&nbsp; You need to act now to protect your organization’s cyber infrastructure against cyber-attacks and to prepare to respond to when an incident occurs.&nbsp; Your weakness is the threat actors’ opportunity.</p>
<p>The NIS2 directive and the DORA regulation set out the basic rules you need to follow.&nbsp; Act now to build a clear view of the risks that your organization faces, identify the gaps in your controls and implement <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80815/cyber-hygiene-the-foundation-for-cyber-resilience">best practices</a> for cyber hygiene.&nbsp; Check out your <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80839/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">cyber maturity</a>.&nbsp; To get more details on how to navigate the final stretch attend cyberevolution 2024.</p>
 cyberevolution 2024 
<p>We are excited to invite you to our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">cyberevolution</a> event in Frankfurt on December 3-5, 2024. We will be exploring a wide range of cybersecurity topics, with plenty of chances to chat with industry experts. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5776">Cyber resilience</a> will be one of the big topics on the agenda. In a combined session, Mike Small will discuss “Why you need data backup and how AI can help” and Joshua Hunter will provide insights into “Focus on Cyber Resilience - Prepare, Respond, Resume”. We look forward to seeing you there and have some great discussions.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of technical posts about how Track &amp; Trust works at a component level. To start, we’ll outline how our mesh network technology works in this post. Additionally, I’ll provide quick navigation links to the follow-up articles at the bottom of each article once the series is complete. For now, let’s jump in.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the photo above we’re showcasing part of our fleet of mesh nodes. As you may recall, you may have seen them before in our recent post announcing that we passed our <a href="https://datarella.com/acceptance-test-passed-for-logistics-tracking-and-communication/">site acceptance tests</a> with the <a href="https://www.esa.int/">European Space Agency</a>. Our mesh nodes contain a lot inside. So, what kind of communications superpowers do they possess?</p>
 What’s mesh network technology ? 
<p>Mesh network technology can be a bit confusing but we’ll demystify the jargon. These black boxes are “mesh nodes,” which in our case means they can communicate with one another using wifi-direct. We also use this protocol to send data from Android phones directly to the nodes without a need for any additional gateways nor internet connectivity.</p>
 Why wifi-direct? 
<p>We chose wifi-direct because it’s really fast. In fact, nodes can detect one another and negotiate a wireless data connection even at highway speeds. Furthermore, they can do this with only a brief moment of communication.</p>
<p>We serve our application directly from the mesh node to a logistics employee’s phone using wifi-direct. This is useful because we don’t need an internet connection. Afterall we designed the system to cope with the worst conditions imaginable – and lack of network connectivity is where that starts.</p>
 Layer 1: Cellmesh Layer 
<p>Our partners at <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a> contributed their <a href="https://medium.com/weaver-labs/cellmesh-redefining-connectivity-in-crisis-and-supply-chains-7f10218ea238">cellmesh software</a>. Cellmesh controls automatic detection, negotiation, and handling of communication between nodes. Additionally, it continually searches for communication resources like 4G or satcom and routes data to our servers which ensures continuity of operations in adverse conditions.</p>
 Layer 2: Mesh Node Layer 
<p>Datarella built a software layer on top of the lower-level networking technology from <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a>. Consequently, we call this layer the Mesh Node layer. It has several big jobs:</p>
 
 Manage data piped into cellmesh from user interactions 
 Manage incoming data from cellmesh originating from other nodes 
 Maintain efficient data replication between nodes 
 Manage deletion of data already posted to the backend 
 
<p>In addition, the Mesh Node layer prevents our data pipelines from growing too large with redundant data. Together, the cellmesh and Mesh Node layers enable individual mesh nodes to connect with one another seamlessly. These nodes automatically&nbsp; authenticate their identities cryptographically and freely pass authenticated data back and forth. Nodes can also post this data directly to our backend servers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the image, the blue boxes represent nodes. The boxes provide service continuity for users in the field who want to post information like deliveries, pickups, damage, delays, and more.&nbsp; Sometimes they’re connected to one another but not always.&nbsp; Every box has two 4G cellular antennas and continuously searches for an exit to our Track &amp; Trust cloud.</p>
 Patient and Resilient Mesh Network Technology 
<p>Our boxes are patient. If they’re offline, they wait until they’re online to post data. Alternatively, if they can’t do that, they wait for another node to come along. When connected, they play a game of telephone. For instance, if one node receives a message from another, it queues that message to pass along when it meets another box.</p>
<p>As we add more nodes to the system, it becomes more resilient. Meanwhile, our cellmesh and mesh node services mean that rollout is zero-configuration. Therefore, we simply plug the nodes into the trucks, and they start communicating with one another and the internet. They serve up mobile interfaces for drivers and warehouse workers to provide the most up-to-date information about what’s happening in the field.</p>
<p>Whenever a node connects with the cloud, it shares everything it knows. Moreover, it tells its “colleagues” which messages it successfully passed on. As a result, this allows them to forget information that they know a “colleague” node has already posted. This is technically known as a “gossip protocol” and it’s at the heart of how our Mesh Network Technology manages the information lifecycle.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll explore what happens if 4G isn’t working for some reason. There, we’ll discuss how satellite communications come into play as well as the critical role that GNSS plays.</p>

 Will the new rules be enough to tackle APP fraud, or will it simply cause more problems? Now, more than ever, banks need to innovate and educate to keep one step ahead of the fraudsters. 



 



<p>In a monumental move that has been applauded by consumer protection groups, the Payment Services Regulator (PSR) has mandated that from October 7, victims of Authorized Push Payment (APP) scams in the UK must be refunded (up to £85,000) by the account holder’s bank within a maximum of five days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This amount of £85,000 is significantly lower than the originally proposed £415,000, which was initially met with reservations by the UK Payments Association that it would <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f369205f-1ed1-48fb-a04e-ca88f2b279bf">“threaten the viability of smaller payment companies”</a> . Other concerns were expressed by trade association, UK Finance, which feared the move would encourage more ‘complicit fraud’ and <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ukfinance.org.uk%2Fpolicy-and-guidance%2Fconsultation-responses%2Fuk-finance-response-cp2411-faster-payments-app-scams&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjody.houton%40idnow.io%7C6c322ee90b4d415981ac08dce20039d7%7C509dc8c8e18f4c9c959795c4f158d706%7C1%7C0%7C638633739625931965%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=LxfzS3s43ce9J%2BCECVKrIA4Y9b30TGjZNnara8HJEBo%3D&amp;reserved=0">incentivize fraudsters to claim compensation money</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for the customer, especially those who have fallen victim to APP scams, the move could not have happened sooner.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This is positive news for UK victims of the APP scam, who for too long have often had to deal with the additional stress of attempting to have their money refunded.</p>Grigory Yusupov, Regional Director of UK at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>“This landmark decision should act as a reminder of the responsibility that banks have to their customers and a wake-up call to ensure their fraud-prevention and identity verification tool stack is fit for purpose, especially for social engineering-type attacks.”</p>



<p>It is hoped that the move will go some way to reducing the amount lost to APP scams, which in <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/annual-fraud-report-2024">2023 was estimated at a whopping £459.7 million</a>.</p>



 A positive step forward – for the customer at least. 



<p>Before the recent ruling, there was no guarantee that victims of APP scams would be refunded, or who they should even turn to for help. For the unlucky few whose bank refused to refund, their last call was often to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From April to July 2024 there were<a href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/news/fraud-scam-complaints-hit-highest-ever-level"> 8, 734 complaints about fraud and scams</a>, half of which were regarding APP scams. This was a significant increase on the same period of 2023 (6,094).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year on year rise in APP scam complaints can be attributed to;&nbsp;</p>



  Increase of ‘multi-stage fraud,’ which sees funds pass through numerous banks, resulting in consumers submitting multiple claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  A growth in people inadvertently using their credit or debit cards to pay fraudsters, which are not covered by the Contingent Reimbursement Mode code or the new PSR rules.&nbsp;  



  More online fraud cases submitted by professional representatives, including claims management companies.

 What is an APP scam? 



<p>While there are many different forms of APP scams, the end goal is always the same: to deceive individuals or businesses into sending money by fraudulent means. One of the most common forms of APP fraud is a romance scam. Read the story about how one British woman made it her mission to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">expose the romance scammers</a> and even wrote a book about how she did it.</p>



<p>Other forms of APP fraud include:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purchase scams, where victims use a fake website or link in an attempt to purchase goods or services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impersonation scams, where criminals pose as a well-known company or brand, such as a delivery firm, retailer or even HM Revenue &amp; Customs and claim they have a parcel or bill that needs to be settled, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investment scams occur when victims are duped into sending funds to a fraudster posing as someone with a ‘too good to be true investment.’&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read the story about how one man was contacted on Linkedin with ‘the offer of a lifetime,’ and proceeded to lose almost a million dollars.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many others, including loan fee scams and lost pet scams. In fact, there are new APP scams created regularly, which is one of the reasons why APP scams are so dangerous and why the FOS is kept so busy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraudsters’ methods are always evolving, and we continue to see that reflected in the complaints brought to our service,” said Pat Hurley, Ombudsman Director for Banking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are currently receiving – and resolving – around 500 fraud and scam complaints a week. In all the cases we receive, we’ll look at the individual circumstances and investigate whether a business did everything it was required to do. When we do uphold complaints, we expect firms to learn from our findings and apply them to any future interactions with their customers.”</p>



 What are banks currently doing to tackle APP fraud? 



<p>For banks, preventing APP fraud can often feel like a frustrating game of ‘Whac-A-Mole’; where after finally addressing and educating their customers on one form of APP fraud attack, a new variant suddenly springs up. This is why many banks employ AI to monitor transaction behaviors and cross reference historical spending patterns to flag potentially fraudulent activity. However, relying solely on AI can sometimes result in false positives or missed cases of social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, banks tend to rely on specific risk signals, which are used to ascertain if a) the transaction is valid and authorized by a trusted account holder or b) the flagged activity is a genuine risk. However, as APP scam payments are authorized by the account holder, a regular bank’s defense systems do not necessarily flag such transactions as anomalies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>From October 7, banks will be able to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/fraud-crackdown-could-see-bank-payments-delayed-by-three-days-13226949">pause transactions for up to 72 hours</a> when there are “reasonable grounds to suspect a payment is fraudulent.” Previously, banks had to either process or refuse a payment by the close of the next business day.</p>

 Can customers do anything to protect themselves against APP scams? 



<p>Of course, new regulations like October 7’s ruling may go some way to lessening the impact of APP fraud, by forcing banks to be held responsible, but as APP fraud appeals to human naivety, it can be particularly difficult to protect against. However, there are steps customers can take to protect themselves:</p>



  Too good to be true? If the offer or investment sounds too good to be true or is too cheap to be true, then there’s a good chance it probably is.<br>  Is that really you? Is the bank, delivery company or even <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Keanue Reeves</a> really contacting you? Fraudsters will impersonate anyone. If you’re unsure that the real company is contacting you, get in touch via official channels to check!<br>  I beg your pardon? Fraudsters know that it’s often only a matter of time before people cotton on to the deception, which is why they tend to pressurize people to authorize payments as soon as possible.<br>  How do you want to pay? If a company or person you have dealt with before is asking you to transact via a different payment method, then this is a red flag.&nbsp;<br>  Why do they want that? Do not give passwords or addresses or any other Personal Identifiable Information out over the web.  



 Why are APP scams so common? 



<p>The main reason why APP scams have become so commonplace and pose such a threat to the public isn’t because they are particularly sophisticated – after all, APP scams are essentially just social engineering. According to Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow, it is the sheer scale of attacks that people are subjected to that makes APP scams so dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>It’s a numbers game. We know that if fraudsters send 10 APP scam messages, they are unlikely to catch anyone, but if they send 10,000 messages, statistically there will be people who bite. </p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“More must be done to raise awareness of the dangers of APP scams, especially with the more vulnerable groups like the elderly or the desperate.On paper, the decision to make compensation compulsory is positive, however, I do worry that banks may need to raise interest rates on loans and other services to make up for the loss of profit. In this regard, the financial compensation will affect the bank’s bottom line even more than it currently does.”</p>



 So, will compulsory compensation stop APP fraud? 



<p>Clearly, the fight against APP fraud is one that will not simply end on October 7. In fact, according to UK Finance, it may even make it worse:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We continue to express the opinion that the PSR’s approach may encourage more complicit fraud and exacerbate the APP risk as fraudsters capitalize on a reimbursement model which requires minimal consumer evidence, nor demonstration of consumer caution and a limited opportunity for payment service providers to investigate and challenge the consumer claim. This will inevitably increase the attractiveness of the UK to criminal entities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The battle against APP fraud will not be won overnight. It will require regular regulatory updates to protect the industry. It will need a commitment from banks to educate their customers on the dangers of different forms of APP fraud. It will also require banks to innovate with new methods of fraud detection to not only protect their business bottom line and their customers but also ensure the customer journey is not too dramatically impacted.</p>



 How video identity verification can add an additional layer of protection against APP fraud. 



<p>While there will always be fraudsters on the lookout for new and inventive ways to deceive unsuspecting members of the public, banks have a responsibility to make it as difficult as possible for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As APP fraud relies so heavily on real-time social engineering, a hybrid approach that combines automated detection with real-time human verification can provide an extra layer of defense and help to spot potential coercion. For example, when certain high-risk triggers are detected, such as unusually frequent payments to a new payee or a large, unexpected transaction, a live video verification session can be initiated to verify the transaction before it proceeds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allows the agent to ask specific questions to verify the legitimacy of the transaction and identify potential fraud tactics, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can you explain the purpose of this payment?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Have you been in contact with this payee before?”</p>



<p>“Is there any urgency pushing you to authorise this payment?”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=videoident-flex">VideoIdent Flex</a> is designed to detect fraud at critical touchpoints, offering seamless real-time video verification for high-risk transactions. This solution is not only effective for onboarding and authentication but also plays a vital role in preventing APP fraud at the point of transaction. By combining AI risk scoring and live agent verification, banks can ensure that suspicious transactions are flagged and reviewed before being authorized.</p>

It boasts the widest range of authenticators on the market, including passwordless, phishing-resistant options, FIDO tokens, and patent-protected biometrics (contactless fingerprints, face, and behavioural), and can enhance the security of traditional MFA solutions to improve the security posture of organisations regardless of where they sit along their IAM maturity journey.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>What if there was a way to establish a new trust layer for the internet, enabling secure digital interactions and unlocking valuable transactions that are currently impossible? </p>
<p>In this episode of The SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude sits down with Darrell O’Donnell, Executive Director of the Global Acceptance Network (GAN), to explore this ambitious vision. The GAN aims to create a neutral, non-profit organization that governs digital public infrastructure for exchanging trusted information.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from payment networks like Visa, GAN seeks to standardize conversations around digital credentials and identity across different ecosystems and industries globally.</p>
<p>Some of the valuable topics discussed include:</p>
 
 The problems GAN is trying to solve around digital trust 
 How GAN compares to and complements existing digital identity efforts 
 GAN’s governance structure and business model 
 The role of trust registries in enabling new types of digital interactions 
 
<p>Tune in to learn how GAN could transform digital trust and enable new forms of secure, valuable transactions in our increasingly digital world.</p>
<p> Key Insights:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 GAN (Global Acceptance Network) aims to establish a new trust layer for the internet, ensuring secure and seamless digital credential exchanges. 
 The internet was not built with trust in mind; GAN seeks to address this by building a neutral governance system. 
 GAN is working with ecosystems across different industries to standardize how digital credentials are issued and verified. 
 Unlike Visa, GAN won’t be providing the “rails” for transactions but will facilitate standardized conversations around digital trust. 
 Trust registries are foundational to GAN’s strategy, enabling ecosystems to verify credentials consistently. 
 The importance of building business, governance, and technology together for sustainable trust networks. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Focusing on business, governance, and technology in that order, to unlock commercial value and ensure long-term sustainability. 
 Operationalizing the Trust Over IP framework by applying it in real-world ecosystems. 
 Building trust registries to answer simple yet critical questions like “Is entity X authorized to do Y?” 
 
 Chapters: 
 
 00:00 – What is the Global Acceptance Network (GAN) 
 08:35 – What value does GAN bring to whom? 
 12:05 – Comparing GAN to VISA and SWIFT 
 17:39 – Does GAN need to become a consumer brand? 
 22:49 – Who are GAN Members? What type of relationship will they have with GAN? 
 27:07 – How does GAN differ from and complement National Digital ID programs? 
 36:16 – How is GAN managing its own internal governance? 
 40:19 – What is GAN’s business model? 
 46:27 – How do Trust Registries fit into GAN? 
 53:29 – What is next for the GAN?

<p>When we set out to create Dhiway, we sought a name that would embody the depth of our vision and the clarity of our mission. We wanted a name that would represent not just a combination of letters but a philosophy, a journey, and a commitment to building trust in an increasingly digital world. We aimed to create something that resonated deeply with the essence of knowledge, trust, and purpose. That’s when we turned to one of the most profound Spiritual sources – the Gayatri Mantra.</p>



<p>The word “Dhi” (धी) in Sanskrit means knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. It is a central concept in the Gayatri Mantra:<br></p>



<p>“Om Bhur Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ&nbsp;<br>Tat Savitur Vareṇyaṃ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Bhargo Devasya Dhīmahi&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dhiyo Yo Naḥ Prachodayāt.”<br></p>



<p>The mantra is a prayer to the divine light of knowledge and wisdom, asking for the illumination of our minds. It is this “Dhi” that represents the quest for higher knowledge, intellectual clarity, and the ability to discern the right path. In the context of our company, “Dhi” reflects our focus on building systems based on truth, transparency, and integrity—values that guide us in creating technology that can be trusted.</p>



<p>The second part of our name, “Way,” serves a dual purpose. On the one hand, it represents the path—the journey of discovery, learning, and collaboration that every organization and Individual embarks on. Conversely, it resonates with a deeper question: “Who are you?” It’s a reminder to stay grounded in self-awareness, to constantly ask ourselves whether we are on the right path, and to align our actions with our purpose.</p>



<p>Thus, Dhiway was born, a fusion of the ancient and the modern. While “Dhi” draws from the wisdom of the ages, “Way” looks forward, symbolizing progress, purpose, and the drive to make a meaningful impact.<br><br></p>



<p>Leading the Future of Trust Infrastructure</p>



<p>Dhiway, as a name, is not just symbolic—it’s a reflection of the leadership role we have undertaken in open trust infrastructure technology. In a world where digital interactions are growing at an unprecedented pace, trust has become a critical currency. Whether it’s governments, corporations, or individuals, every stakeholder must be sure that the systems they rely on are secure, verifiable, and trustworthy.</p>



<p>At Dhiway, we collaborate with diverse partners to build solutions that deliver absolute certainty in the digital realm. Our work with cutting-edge blockchain technology and open standards ensures that data, identity, and digital transactions are managed with the highest levels of security and assurance. This aligns with our core philosophy: knowledge is not just about information; it’s about trust and integrity.<br><br></p>



<p>A Path Forward</p>



<p>As we continue to grow, the name Dhiway is a constant reminder of our chosen path—a path defined by knowledge, wisdom, and trust. In everything we do, from designing digital credentials to enabling secure data exchanges, we strive to stay true to these principles.</p>



<p>Our name is not just a label. It’s a guiding force that pushes us to lead, innovate, and create a world where trust is the foundation of every interaction. Whether it’s creating digital credentials that ensure privacy or working with open standards for data exchanges, Dhiway’s solutions are designed to bring certainty where it’s needed most. At its core, our work reflects the values encapsulated in our name: knowledge, integrity, and a clear path forward.</p>



<p>Our name reflects this journey — one of enlightenment, truth, and unwavering commitment to building a better, more trusted world.</p>

 Companies are transforming the way their customers access and reuse their services. Is it time you explored reusable identities?&nbsp; 



<p>Managing customer accounts and customers’ online identities has become a major challenge for businesses and customers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there have been significant strides over the last decade regarding remote identity verification, with a variety of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led identity verification solutions</a> now available, most options still require repeat verification. For example, each time a customer wishes to open an account or register for a highly regulated service, they need to complete an identification process, which is far from ideal from a business or customer experience standpoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/yris/">digital identity solutions like IDnow’s YRIS</a>, customers can verify and reuse their identity instantly and effortlessly across a multitude of industries and regulated services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/yris-substantial-level-digital-identities-eidas/">YRIS’s recent Substantial Level of Assurance (LoA) certification</a>, it is now recognized as providing a level of identity assurance equivalent to face-to-face verification.</p>



<blockquote><p>It is highly likely that digital identity will rapidly become the norm for accessing a multitude of online services, for citizens and businesses alike.</p> Marie Duval, Product Manager for YRIS at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Government green light. Which countries have digital identities?&nbsp; 



<p>There are currently 2.5 billion people around the world with digital identities, but that figure is expected to reach 4 billion by 2026. India lays claim to the world’s largest biometric ID system. Aadhaar is used by 99% of Indian adults (1.3 billion people) for tasks like opening bank accounts and obtaining SIM cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe, one of the first nations to fully embrace digital identity verification was Estonia. In fact, E-ID and its digital signature service was launched over 20 years ago, in 2002. Use cases include e-prescriptions, and i-voting, which is used by approximately 33% of Estonians, wherever they are, to cast votes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The success of a nation’s digital identity strategy comes largely down to how strongly the private and public sector pushes for its adoption. For example, in France, digital identity is driven by a combination of ambitious public initiatives and innovative private solutions like YRIS.</p>



 
   
     
                     Identity crisis? The future of digital identity in the UK.

<p>The UK’s digital identity approach has been more hesitant and nuanced. In 2022, it released its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verification-provider/">Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards designed to establish trust in digital identity products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hundreds of use cases across the public and private sectors where digital identities could be used to optimize the user experience. For example, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>. The UK government has decided to start off with just a few use cases: Right to Work, Right to Rent, and DBS Checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As these solutions improve and their adoption grows, it is highly likely that digital identity will soon become the standard for accessing a multitude of online services, both in the public and the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world of economic, societal and political possibilities opened by digital identities is vast and varied. According to research from the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth">McKinsey Global Institute</a><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth">,</a> countries that implement digital identities could unlock between 3-13% of GDP by 2030. Broad adoption of an interoperable digital ID system will increase inclusion, and provide greater access to finance, health and other essential services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out below for the top five benefits of digital identity usage for businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Enhanced security and protection against identity theft.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the main advantages of digital identity lies in the enhanced security it provides. With advanced methods like multi-factor authentication and the use of biometrics, the risks of fraud and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a> are significantly reduced. These technologies ensure that the user is who they claim to be, thus limiting the chances of identity theft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, digital identity helps to better protect users’ sensitive personal data. By centralizing the management of this data and relying on strict security standards, companies can ensure better protection of personal information, which is crucial in a world increasingly exposed to cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Improved operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Along with strengthening security, digital identity also improves operational efficiency within organizations by automating processes and reducing processing times, such as during new client onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using centralized platforms for identity management, businesses can reduce costs associated with manual management. These gains in efficiency improve productivity and tracking and reduce human errors.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Optimized user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 This Month in Digital Identity — October&nbsp;Edition <p>Welcome to the October edition of our monthly digital identity series! This month, we’re exploring the critical developments and innovative strategies that are redefining the landscape of digital identity. We’ll delve into significant advancements in decentralized identity, the balance between regulation and privacy, the role of biometric technology in hiring compliance, and the establishment of security standards for digital ID wallets in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the essential topics we’ll be covering:</p> Advancing Decentralized Identity with the SLAP Framework <p>Velocity Network has dedicated the past five years to developing the Internet of Careers, focusing on essential business needs through the SLAP framework. This innovative approach emphasizes four critical components:</p>  Survivable Credentials: These credentials are designed to remain valid and accessible over time, ensuring that users can reliably present their identities without facing barriers.  Legal Risk Mitigation: By addressing potential legal challenges associated with identity verification, organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to regulatory pitfalls, fostering a more secure environment for both users and businesses.  Accreditation for Issuers and Relying Parties: Establishing trusted standards for all participants in the identity ecosystem helps to enhance credibility and build trust among&nbsp;users.  Practical Privacy: Prioritizing user privacy ensures that individuals maintain control over their personal information, which is essential in today’s digital landscape.  <p>Velocity Network’s collaborative efforts invite stakeholders from various sectors to contribute to effective decentralized identity solutions. By working together, we can empower individuals with greater control over their identities and foster a more inclusive digital ecosystem.</p> Navigating the Tension Between Decentralized Identity and Regulation <p>In the ever-evolving digital landscape, the interplay between decentralized identity and regulatory frameworks has become increasingly critical. High-profile cases such as Silk Road and Tornado Cash highlight the challenges of balancing innovation with compliance.</p><p>To address these challenges, it is essential to adopt a balanced approach that fosters the development of decentralized reputation systems. Such systems can empower self-regulation while ensuring both privacy and accountability. By leveraging anonymous identities, we can create a framework where individuals have control over their digital presence while participating responsibly in digital platforms.</p><p>This approach not only enhances user empowerment but also helps build trust within communities. Learning from past experiences with regulatory challenges can inform the design of more resilient and adaptable decentralized identity systems. By understanding the nuances of this complex relationship, we can pave the way for innovative solutions that respect both freedom and the need for regulation.</p> Enhancing Hiring Compliance in the UK with Yoti Biometrics <p>Yoti is making significant strides in the UK hiring landscape by integrating biometric technology with Sterling’s background checks. This partnership aims to streamline compliance and enhance the security and accuracy of identity verification during the hiring&nbsp;process.</p><p>By utilizing Yoti’s biometric solutions, employers can simplify the compliance process, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements efficiently. This integration not only reduces the risk of non-compliance but also enhances security, making it more difficult for fraudulent activities to&nbsp;occur.</p><p>Candidates benefit from this system as well, enjoying a smoother onboarding experience. The biometric verification process is designed to be quick and user-friendly, allowing job seekers to complete identity checks seamlessly. This innovative approach not only improves the overall efficiency of the hiring process but also instills greater confidence among employers and candidates alike.</p><p>As organizations increasingly recognize the value of biometric technology, Yoti’s integration with Sterling’s background checks stands as a promising development for the future of hiring compliance in the&nbsp;UK.</p> ENISA to Launch Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for EU Digital ID&nbsp;Wallets <p>In a significant move to bolster security in the digital identity landscape, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is set to establish a cybersecurity certification scheme for the EU’s digital ID wallets. This initiative aims to ensure that digital identity solutions meet high standards of security and trustworthiness, thereby promoting consumer confidence in these technologies.</p><p>The certification scheme will provide a robust framework for assessing and validating the security measures implemented in digital ID wallets. By aligning with EU regulations and standards, this initiative supports the broader strategy of creating a secure and interoperable digital identity ecosystem within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>ENISA emphasizes the importance of collaboration with various stakeholders, including industry leaders and governmental bodies, to develop a comprehensive certification process. This collaborative approach is crucial for addressing the diverse needs and challenges in the digital identity landscape.</p><p>By fostering trust in digital identity solutions, this initiative paves the way for increased adoption and reliance on secure digital services across the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>We look forward to bringing you more insightful updates as we continue to explore the latest trends and innovations in the field of digital identity. Together, we can contribute to a more secure and inclusive digital&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/this-month-in-digital-identity-october-edition-f7776d9de98d">This Month in Digital Identity — October Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Biometrics and digital identity&nbsp;</p>
<p>As travelers increasingly expect to be able to do almost anything from the comfort of their home and the convenience of their smartphones, biometrics and digital identity are central to meeting these expectations of seamless digital travel.</p>
<p>To make this seamless world a reality requires a single digital identity that will work across platforms and unify the traveler’s journey from airport to destination and back again — and be capable of integrating ancillary travel and tourist services.</p>
<p>In a way, the technology goal is similar to how it is possible to login to different websites using a federated identity, such as a Google account. But it differs in two important aspects: One, this digital identity is derived from government systems of record, such as a passport, and not a third-party identity provider; and two, you control and store this identity and the personal data associated with it, and not a third-party identity provider.</p>
<p>These features are critical for privacy and privacy compliance (the traveler always has the power of consent to sharing data) and security (removing the centralized storage of personal data, especially biometric data, removes the risk of mass data breaches, identity fraud, and catastrophic loss of trust).</p>
<p>The emergence of technology solutions that meet these requirements is explored in the new <a href="https://www.the-prism-project.com/th-prism-download">2024 Biometric Digital Identity Travel and Hospitality Prism Report</a> from Acuity Market Intelligence. The report, which first launched in 2023, analyzes the state of the solution market and sets out an evaluative framework for what is working best to deliver seamless travel. In sum, it is technology that “puts human beings first,” namely:</p>
 
 Digital identity belongs to the user it describes. 
 True ID empowerment relies on government systems of record. 
 Identity must be consistently and continuously orchestrated to remain secure. 
 Biometrics must be at the core of any sustainable digital identity ecosystem. 
 
<p>“By investing in biometric digital identity solutions like those identified in [the report], travel and hospitality stakeholders will find measurable benefits—from improved guest flow, to bulletproof compliance, to secure loyalty programs. But beyond the immediately tangible results, participating in the biometric digital identity ecosystem has a wider, global effect.”</p>
<p>The report highlights the work of&nbsp; Indicio and its partner SITA, for developing solutions that “masterfully deploy biometric guest experiences around the globe.”</p>
<p>Indicio and SITA created the first successfully deployed Digital Travel Credential for seamless border crossing. By using Verifiable Credential technology, travelers were able to turn their passports into “government-grade” digital identities for instant, frictionless, authentication. A key feature of the Indicio-SITA credential solution is the ability to bind the biometrics in a passport to the rightful owner of that passport. This, in effect, created a two-factor biometric authentication without the need for airports or airlines to store biometric data.</p>
<p>To learn more about “bring your own biometrics,” and how Verifiable Credentials enable seamless data sharing, <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a> for a demo —&nbsp;or book a free workshop where we’ll analyze your use case.</p>

<p>We’re excited today to reveal the hardware and a bit of software magic behind <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust/">Track &amp; Trust</a> and announce a milestone achievement on our way to commercializing the product! Track &amp; Trust is a logistics tracking and communication suite toolset. This post dives into basics of the hardware and the software that drives it as well as some of the unique capabilities of the system. We’ll be following up with a series of posts on the tech and also on the pilot in the field!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve just passed our “Site Acceptance Test” with the <a href="https://www.esa.int/">European Space Agency</a>. This test evaluates the entire technical range of functionalities expected for the <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust/">Track &amp; Trust</a> system. Consequently, we’re proud to announce that we passed all the tests in the three-day site acceptance test inspection. We tested all thirty-four formal technical requirements of the system. Although the testing took place in June, we had to keep quiet about it for operational reasons. Meanwhile, our team has been working hard to prepare for the next phase.</p>
<p>We’re building the ultimate communications system with our partners at <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a> and <a href="https://ororatech.com/">Ororatech</a>. Specifically, Track &amp; Trust relies on “magical” black boxes that make logistics tracking and communication possible in the worst conditions. These boxes can withstand internet outages, power outages, and wet conditions. You can plug them into a truck and they’ll keep working. In addition, they’re designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate with existing systems.</p>
 What’s in the black box? 
<p>Our partners at <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a> built hardware with a Swiss Army knife of multi-bearer communications capabilities. It doesn’t need the internet to load the software. The boxes pack 4G radios, two WiFi radios, and <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a> clever cellmesh software capabilities. These capabilities enable them to talk to each other offline, exchange information, and post when possible. They can post using traditional 4G or the included satcom uplink from <a href="https://ororatech.com/">Ororatech</a>. Furthermore, this technology allows for seamless communication between devices, even in areas with limited connectivity.</p>
<p>We at Datarella have built a suite of interfaces into <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust/">Track &amp; Trust</a> that any user can leverage to contribute cryptographically signed inputs about logistics events. Our system has real-time monitoring and CI/CD capabilities that enable us to fix issues on the fly. This is a plug-and-play solution for gathering more information about shipments. We can funnel this information directly into logistics service providers’ databases using our APIs. As a result, our customers can enjoy greater visibility and control over their supply chains.</p>
 Value for Logistics Tracking Organizations 
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust/">Track &amp; Trust</a> generates secure, validated events with every user interaction. These events are geolocated with GNSS and timestamped. We anchor them to the fetch.ai blockchain via a hashing mechanism, resulting in a powerful combination of privacy and immutability. Moreover, this ensures that all data is tamper-proof and transparent.</p>
<p>We delayed posting about it publicly because we needed to move quickly and get the devices into our planned piloting environment in Lebanon. This required sensitive handling. Now we’re making progress on the pilot operations in the field, despite difficult conditions. Finally, we’re excited to share more details from the summer and look forward to continuing our work on this groundbreaking project.</p>

 Traditional evaluation looks backward; innovation looks forward. How do we evaluate innovation in real&nbsp;time? <p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisemontano/">Elise Montano</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-barry-mel/">Niamh Barry</a> on the Measurement &amp; Impact team at <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou&nbsp;Digital</a>.</p><p>Innovation programs cultivate an environment of experimentation and continuous improvement in developing, implementing, and scaling new ideas, products, or processes to drive growth. These programs depend on rapid, actionable insights to stay ahead and be ready to pivot strategies and optimize outcomes in real time. However, many traditional evaluation approaches are neither responsive nor adaptive to the speed and focus of insights needed in innovation programs.</p><p>In Caribou Digital’s work with <a href="https://www.strivecommunity.org/">Mastercard Strive</a>, we sought opportunities to break away from traditional evaluation models to try a new approach that retained values of timeliness, flexibility, agility, and rigor, with a clear understanding of real-world constraints. From this experience, we devised an evaluative approach to support programs working in dynamic systems to generate impactful and incisive insights that enhance performance and&nbsp;impact.</p> Traditional evaluation is failing innovation programs. <p>Evaluations are usually conducted at predetermined moments in a program — for example, mid- or endpoint — rather than when stakeholders need information. Such evaluations are focused on pre-established questions and do not respond to program stakeholders’ dynamic and complex insights needs. They typically focus on accountability and documenting processes, not learning and improving program performance.</p><p>Innovative programs need real time information that supports dynamic learning, rapid response, and experimentation for continuous improvement. Traditional evaluation approaches are simply too rigid and fail to address these core&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Organizations that deliver complex programs need a better way of getting incisive insights at critical moments while maintaining evaluative rigor.</p> Our modular evaluation approach works with innovation programs. <p>Building on <a href="https://www.evalcommunity.com/career-center/formative-evaluation/">formative</a> and <a href="https://www.betterevaluation.org/methods-approaches/approaches/developmental-evaluation">developmental evaluation principles</a>, we developed a flexible and agile approach to generating evaluative insights within the Mastercard Strive program. We call this “modular evaluation.” The characteristics of this approach&nbsp;include:</p>  Embedded: Work is led and conducted by evaluation specialists immersed in the program delivery. <br>&gt;&gt; The Caribou Measurement and Impact team is part of Mastercard Strive program delivery, working daily with program directors, grantees, and partners. We used our detailed knowledge of the program and its complexities, constraints, and learning objectives in evaluations`.  Modular: Evaluations are conducted in thematic modules that enable faster, more focused, and concise work. <br>&gt;&gt; We deployed three thematic modules — 1) small business outcomes, 2) program strategy and governance, and 3) partner management — allowing us to focus entirely on each module in&nbsp;turn.  Flexible deployment: Evaluations are delivered as and when insights are needed to support strategic decision-making, not according to a prescribed timeline. <br>&gt;&gt; We delivered the partner management module with our first phase of programs before developing a second phase so the insights from one could be rolled into the next. We also conducted our small business outcomes module twice, nine months apart, to generate insights when grantees had the most data available.  Lean: Evaluations focus only on pertinent questions and data collection methods. They enhance existing data collected through regular reporting with lean data collection where it counts. <br>&gt;&gt; For each module, we used grantee data from existing reports and filled the information gaps through focused interviews.  <p>The benefits of this approach were immediately evident to our team and clients. We lined up evaluation modules to deploy throughout the project to provide insights at the moment they had the most strategic value.</p><p>We identified five key outcomes of this approach based on our experience.</p> 1. Modular evaluations enable precision and flexibility, supporting insights at decisive&nbsp;times. <p>Our approach acknowledges that some modules or topics may require faster, more focused, and more concise work, or have different internal and external stakeholders reliant on insights. Each module can be managed independently, with its own evaluation questions and analytical frameworks, according to a timeline that best supports decision-making.</p><p>In Mastercard Strive, our small business outcomes module was adapted based on the outcomes expected at specific points. For example, the first iteration delivered insights on the impact of strategies for engaging small businesses with various solutions. It suggested where pivots could support deeper engagement and what other types of programs would address gaps in our portfolio. The second iteration — conducted nine months later — assessed early outcomes from our first phase of grantees (e.g., on small business capabilities and uptake of new business practices, products, and services) and revisited solution engagement data to incorporate new results and grantees. Future outcomes modules toward the end of the program will look at long-term outcomes and the sustainability of impacts for small businesses.</p> Mastercard Strive small business outcomes evaluation module  2. Focused modules support rapid delivery of insights. <p>Each evaluation module took at most three months to complete, and interim insights were often available within a month of launching data collection. In contrast, traditional evaluations can often take over six months to deliver final insights. Collecting and combining data across multiple themes from a wide range of sources adds complexity to the process of analyzing and presenting that data. In addition to lean data collection, agile approaches allow evaluators to focus on specific topics, dig into the details, and identify more nuanced and detailed insights.</p> 3. Rapid insights support adaptive strategies. <p>Access to real time learning enables grant and fund managers to be dynamic and responsive, and make evidence-based decisions by working with our measurement and impact team. Our granting strategy evaluation module built on insights gleaned through ad hoc meetings and reporting, leading to a quick — but structured — approach to collecting and analyzing primary data. Within four weeks, our team had mapped the strengths and weaknesses of the granting and grantee management processes. We delivered concise recommendations that immediately fed into our second granting phase, including how we selected, developed, and managed programs.</p> 4. Flexible timing and focused modules support stakeholder recall. <p>Traditional evaluations often interview stakeholders once on a wide range of topics, making for unwieldy interviews that ask questions about decisions made over a year before. A more flexible approach allowed our teams to conduct shorter, more focused interviews with stakeholders. The interviews were concise, asked questions about recent decisions, and allowed participants to prepare more effectively.</p> 5. Modular evaluations are more cost-efficient. <p>We found this evaluative approach more cost-efficient than traditional evaluations for three reasons. First, the rapid, iterative nature of modular evaluations supports learning and continuous improvement that reveals opportunities for experimentation and adaptation earlier on, avoiding costly mistakes. Second, modular evaluations are inherently lean. Data collection builds on existing knowledge and is respectful of participants’ time, giving them clear boundaries of the scope of each module. Evaluation teams are embedded within the programs and don’t need to spend time learning about programs’ context. Finally, the modular nature of this evaluation supports scalability. Program managers have flexibility on what is included and how much budget they are willing to dedicate to evaluations, ensuring that each module delivers adequate value for&nbsp;money.</p> Deploying modular evaluations in innovation programs <p>Modular evaluations are distinguished from ongoing monitoring or measurement. While optimizing the insights from monitoring systems, these are coupled with rigorous evaluative approaches and question how and why a particular outcome has been observed. To deploy modular evaluations, organizations require budget flexibility, an embrace of uncertainty about evaluation timing and focus, and a team that is open and supportive of real time learning.</p><p>At Caribou Digital, we’ve seen the value obtained from flexible innovation-supportive approaches and are excited to promote a method that works with and for technology-focused innovation programs. We continue to deploy modular evaluations in our work and collaborate with others who are similarly interested in ensuring that evaluations are candid, purposeful, and timely.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>The Zero Trust security model is designed to enhance cybersecurity by eliminating inherent trust within networks and requiring strict verification for every access request. However, Zero Trust is a multifaceted cybersecurity strategy that extends far beyond simple identity verification. While confirming user identity is essential, focusing solely on this aspect overlooks the depth and breadth of what Zero Trust truly encompasses.</p>
<p>To strengthen their defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, organizations must adopt a comprehensive Zero Trust strategy that secures all facets of their digital environment. By integrating robust measures across identity, devices, networks, applications, and data, coupled with analytics and automation, organizations can achieve a more resilient and proactive cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p>Here’s how these fundamental aspects—users, devices, applications, networks, data, visibility, and automation—play a critical role in a Zero Trust strategy:</p>
<p>1. Users: Zero Trust security starts with stringent identity verification. Techniques like multi-factor and continuous authentication ensure that only authorized users access resources, minimizing insider threats and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>2. Devices: All devices must be secured and continuously monitored. This includes compliance checks, real-time device inspection, assessment, and patching to ensure that devices accessing the network are not compromising security.</p>
<p>3. Systems and Applications: Protecting systems and applications involves implementing advanced measures such as software risk management, application inventory, and continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities and anomalies.</p>
<p>4. Networks: Focusing on granular policy, real-time access decisions, and segmentation strategies such as micro-segmentation helps control access and prevent lateral movement within networks, a critical strategy to isolate and contain threats.</p>
<p>5. Data: Zero Trust necessitates rigorous data protection measures such as encryption and access controls to ensure data integrity and confidentiality, crucial for compliance and security. Organizations can also adopt more advanced techniques, such as data loss prevention and data monitoring and sensing.</p>
<p>6. Visibility and Analytics: Comprehensive monitoring across networks and systems helps detect anomalies and potential threats, providing the necessary insights to preemptively address security issues.</p>
<p>7. Automation and Orchestration: Streamlining responses to security events through automation and orchestration reduces response times and enhances security operations, making threat detection and mitigation more efficient.</p>
<p>For organizations implementing Zero Trust, it's essential to integrate these elements into a cohesive strategy that aligns with Zero Trust principles, adapting over time to meet the dynamic nature of cyber threats. This holistic approach not only enhances security but also supports operational efficiency and compliance across all organizational levels.</p>

<p>Given my recent posts on <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/09/20/the-wallets-are-coming-but-are-we-ready-for-whats-next/">digital wallets</a> and the <a href="https://refeds.org/a/2984">future of academic identity federation</a>, you might be able to tell I’m on a bit of a rant. These topics share a common thread: we have a lot of experience building trust frameworks but significantly less experience in operationalizing those trust frameworks and making them sustainable.</p>



 What’s a Trust Framework? 



<p>Backing up a bit, let’s discuss a trust framework in this post’s context. According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8149">NISTIR 8149</a>, a trust framework is “the ‘rules’ underpinning federated identity management, typically consisting of system, legal, conformance, and recognition.” It’s about applying a whole set of technical and governance rules to the protocols, contracts, and regulations that let you use a digital identity from one organization to sign-in to another organizations services. A trust framework the backbone of how federated identity functions effectively—at least in theory.</p>



<p>For those who care about ensuring safe and effective interoperability, though, the rules defined in a trust framework are critical and everyone should apply them in their federations. Operationalizing trust frameworks means doing more than ‘just’ defining the policies and rules (as if that’s not hard enough). It also means creating the practical mechanisms and governance structures to make those rules measurable, enforceable, and part of daily operations. It means moving from theoretical planning to real-world execution, with a way to know when the frameworks are being correctly applied and when an entity is out of conformance.</p>



 The Funding Crisis Nobody Wants to Talk About 



<p>This is where the real problem lies. Who funds this infrastructure? A trust framework involves a ridiculous number of different organizations. They are all supported in various ways, and the identity federation part of their services is rarely the primary reason they exist. (University IdPs are not the reason that universities exist. Identity and access management services are not why publishers sell journal subscriptions.)</p>



<p>The federation operators themselves are often underfunded and overstretched. Out of all the global federations, only a handful have the resources to innovate. The rest? They’re in survival mode—keeping old systems running and sticking with SAML because it works well enough. They can’t afford to migrate. How can they require their federation members to pay to comply with a trust framework when the benefits are intangible to their core missions?</p>



 Lessons from the R&amp;E Space: We Can’t Just Ignore the Underfunded Parts 



<p>The worlds of commerce and government, while buzzing about digital wallets and verifiable credentials, need to wake up to the realities that the R&amp;E federations have lived with for decades. Trust isn’t just a tech problem; it’s a governance problem, a funding problem, a sustainability problem. Right now, too many organizations are excited about issuing credentials without thinking about how to manage them when things go wrong.</p>



<p>The Research and Education (R&amp;E) federations have been there, done that, and frankly, are still wondering if it’s worth doing again. They’ve experienced the growing pains that come with scaling trust across borders and organizations, but they’re also exhausted—financially and operationally. It’s not that they don’t want to help; they can’t afford to.</p>



<p>R&amp;E federations have the trust frameworks. They don’t have the resources necessary to operationalize those frameworks in a way that reaches all parties involved.</p>



 What’s the Future for Trust Frameworks? 



<p>So, where does that leave us? If we want federated identity to work sustainably across sectors and borders, we need to figure out the support model(s). We need a governance structure that doesn’t just sound good in theory but works in practice without requiring federations to burn themselves out.</p>



<p>And yes, some of this may come from government backing. However, we also need to think about models that work where government involvement isn’t the answer—where decentralized, community-driven approaches, like <a href="https://refeds.org/sirtfi">REFEDS SIRTFI</a> for incident response, are more appropriate. We need to build bridges between these different types of frameworks and find a way for them to coexist, or else we’re just going to keep reinventing the wheel.</p>



<p>Ultimately, operationalizing trust frameworks is about more than technology or policies. It’s about ensuring that the people running the systems have the support they need, that the lights stay on, and that we don’t lose trust simply because we can’t afford to maintain it. The R&amp;E sector has valuable lessons to offer, but without a more collaborative and well-funded approach, the rest of the identity world might find itself learning those same lessons the hard way.</p>



 A Call to Action Without All the Answers 



<p>I recognize that I’m shouting about a problem for which I don’t have an answer. But that’s exactly why I’m getting all rant-y about this. I hope we can collectively develop more effective ideas—better than the grassroots community efforts of the past—so that every organization involved finally recognizes the infrastructure underpinning our trust frameworks as critical. This effort isn’t just about keeping federated identity afloat; we must support, value, and encourage it to evolve, so it can deliver on its promise for the long haul.</p>

 The Brazilian Finance Ministry has set a new deadline for operators to apply for a license. Will you be ready for January 1? 



<p>Discussions regarding Brazil’s online gambling market have been ongoing since 2018, when the National Congress tasked the federal government with regulating the industry.</p>



<p>Back then, it was hoped that new regulations would create a safer and more transparent gambling environment, which would increase government revenue through taxation, protect players from fraud and promote responsible gambling practices. Many believed that such changes would also attract both local and international operators and transform Brazil into a major hub for the gambling industry in Latin America.</p>



<p>There have been numerous twists and turns since then, but in July 2024, Brazil’s regulatory process for online gambling, which included 10 detailed ordinances, was finally completed.</p>



<p>The new rules impose strict requirements on both local and international operators, including financial thresholds and rigorous background checks to ensure transparency and prevent money laundering. A mandatory fee structure for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">license applications</a> was also established, ensuring that only financially stable and well-regulated companies could enter the market.</p>



<p>Read more about the other regulatory requirements, along with the multitude of challenges and opportunities facing gambling operators in Brazil in an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazil-sports-betting-regulations-interview/">interview with Ronaldo Kos, LATAM Gaming here</a>.</p>



<p>Initially, companies had until August 2024 to apply for a license; those that were successful would be able to operate under the new bet.br domain from January 1, 2025; other gambling domains, including .com, would be blocked. It was announced that other licensing application windows would be announced in due time.</p>



<p>However, in mid-September, Brazil’s Finance Ministry announced that operators that had not applied for a license by midnight on September 30 would have to cease operations from October 1 until they had applied and received their permits. Any that continued to operate would be subject to having their websites blocked and fines of up to R$2 billion (US$354 million).</p>



<blockquote><p>The two-week notice period was certainly a surprise for the industry. As gambling operators rush to get their applications submitted in time, it’s important they do things correctly and ensure they have the right technological stack in place, especially to comply with identity verification requirements.</p>Ronaldo Kos, LATAM Gaming at IDnow</blockquote>



 All bets are off. Why the rush? 



<p>Ensuring all operators meet strict legal and ethical standards will strengthen the integrity of the sector and so is an admirable, yet sudden, step for the Ministry to take. Many, however, are left wondering the same thing: Why the change of dates? The cynical may think it is just to gather additional revenue as soon as possible, but according to Finance Minister, Fernando Haddad, this has nothing to do with it.</p>



<p>Many, including Fernando, believe Brazil is suffering from a ‘gambling epidemic,’ citing the nearly <a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/geral/noticia/2024-09/bets-pandemic-spreads-faster-covid-19-outbreak-brazil">25 million people who placed sports bets in the first seven months of 2024</a>, averaging around 3.5 million new users per month.</p>



<p>Read more about the dangers of using grey market platforms in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">blog, ‘Before Brazilian regulation: The dangers of gambling without KYC.’</a></p>



<p>Gambling has become a serious social problem and one <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/09/19/79253-brazil-39s-finance-minister-vows-to-crack-down-on-unregulated-betting-amid-39pandemic-39-of-gambling-addiction">the Finance Minister has vowed to crack down on.</a></p>



<p>It is for this reason, among many others, that underscore the importance, and appetite, of the Brazilian sports betting market becoming regulated as soon as possible. Further checks, linked to spending limits, are likely to be mandated in the coming months to protect the most vulnerable groups, including the <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/bills-gambling-brazil-pressure/?utm_source=feedotter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FO-09-30-2024&amp;utm_content=httpsigamingbusinesscomlegalcomplianceregulationbillsgamblingbrazilpressure#msdynmkt_trackingcontext=9e0ced13-71c2-48a1-b046-e51bc55cf20a">elderly and those receiving state benefits</a>.</p>



 



 

 



 How many Brazilian operators have applied for a license? 



<p>So far, <a href="https://sigap.fazenda.gov.br/consulta-publica/lista-solicitacoes">132 companies</a> have submitted their applications to continue operations, and that number is constantly increasing as the deadline approaches.</p>



<p>All active operators who submit an application before the October 1 deadline will be allowed to continue operating, providing they are granted a license. Companies that applied before August 20 have been assured that they will receive a decision from the government regarding the status of their license application in time to be able to start operating from January 1. Those that applied after this date can continue to operate as usual until the end of the year but may not be able to continue ‘business as usual’ once regulated betting begins from January 1. Those that operate without a license run the risk of a fine and being banned for up to 10 years.</p>



<p>After the October 1 deadline, the government will process the pool of applicants and issue licenses. The government has until November 17 to give companies an answer and as of right now there has been no mention of a limit on the number of licenses being given. Once an operator has been approved, they then have 15 days to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/brazil-suspend-betting-firms-with-no-authorization-request-amid-gambling-2024-09-17/">pay the fee of 30 million reais ($5.45 million)</a> in order to continue doing business.</p>



 Playing by the rules: What are the guidelines going forward? 



<p>Once the official ordinances go into effect at the beginning of January, all authorized gambling operators must use the bet.br domain in order to be distinguished from unauthorized platforms, including .com.</p>



<p>Credit cards will no longer be a valid form of payment and instead only debit cards or Pix (the Brazilian instant payment system ecosystem) will be accepted.</p>



<p>Operators will also be required to perform a robust identification process during onboarding. It is therefore of utmost importance to choose an identity verification provider that can meet the very specific challenges of the Brazil market:</p>



  Be able to process a wide range of different Brazilian identity documents.  Perform KYC and gather customer information, such as full name, date of birth and valid identification documents.  Verify citizens’ CPF numbers and ensure that they do not appear on any of the various government-mandated restriction lists.  Facial biometric verification is now mandatory for registration, with regular facial re-verifications a requirement.  



<p>Operators must also monitor transactions for suspicious activity to prevent money laundering, fraud and underage gambling. The goal of these KYC measures is to enhance consumer protection, promote responsible gambling and ensure compliance with Brazil’s broader efforts to create a transparent and secure gambling environment. Non-compliance with these requirements can result in severe penalties, including the loss of the operator’s license.</p>



<blockquote><p>Operators will therefore need to ensure their platform can onboard customers quickly, safely and securely. A robust KYC process guarantees that customers are who they say they are, while preventing fraud and protecting the business and the customer at the same time.</p> Ronaldo Kos, LATAM Gaming at IDnow </blockquote>

<p>The honourable Finance Minister presented a much-anticipated budget for FY 24-25, and those who are familiar with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) will find some topics interesting. The budget mentioned DPI to support farmers by improving access to digital tools. An extension to that is data digitization and reusability through the Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or “Bhu-Aadhaar” and the digitization of land records in urban areas with contextual GIS data.</p>



<p>Bringing DPI into a discussion around data digitisation, enabling reusable data exchange and creating digital identifiers opens the IT architecture to the concept of “trust layers”. Today, as many citizen services are transitioning from traditional Web 2.0 models to Web 3.0 design patterns, trustworthy data exchange is critical to reducing transaction friction. The “trust” component of data exchange is enabled through distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) such as blockchain. As new service deployments bring about digital identifiers, digital cards, and records, and, more importantly, there is a need to have authentic data sources to query, it is vital to view DPIs from the perspective of Open Trust Infrastructure.</p>



<p>Public instances of a blockchain, such as CORD, form the foundation of the Open Trust Infrastructure. Combining open standards, networks, and protocols with open innovation makes the available building blocks critical for designing applications and services around them. Trustworthy data exchange is enabled through the issuance and acceptance networks of verifiable credentials (VCs) and verifiable data streams, allowing purpose-specific data sharing and verification with a notice/consent design embedded within.</p>



<p>The trust layer of the blockchain will bring about open infrastructure such as data fingerprinting registries, credentialing registries, and key management services. Data registries on the blockchain allow regulatory authorities to openly govern data while ensuring it is accessible to services with high fidelity and quality. Among the nine priority areas highlighted in the Budget 2024 speech, each can have a multiplier impact when DPIs with data registries are enabled for the services and innovative solutions can be incubated around such infrastructure.</p>



<p>Verifiable Credentials are increasingly becoming mainstream – sometimes without the end consumer realizing that the records they manage are secure, tamper-resistant VCs. This is a positive sign that the end-consumer experience can be transformed from a paper-based system of low-trust and low-fidelity to a high-trust and high-fidelity digitally secure method. With this, it is not surprising that organizations and educational institutions are today using credentialing platforms to issue VCs for learning and educational records (LERs), Skilling and Knowledge Records (SKRs) and Workplace Credentials (WPCs). Secure, verifiable credentialing is a natural outcome of an Open Trust Infrastructure.</p>



<p>With DPIs and Open Trust Infrastructure, it is crucial to view the multiple views and access to data services from the perspective of digital trust ecosystems. This, in turn, ensures better governance and operational management of such infrastructure through consortium-like approaches, which provide participants with necessary incentives to maintain and improve these digital rails.</p>



<p>As ISVs and SIs come together to implement the critical parts of the digital infrastructure required to deliver the records such as skilling and knowledge credentials or the Kisan Credit Cards – with the DPI design model, it will be possible to use the CORD blockchain to rapidly prototype and deliver production-ready software that is capable of being used at nation-scale. The CORD Blockchain also allows for a decentralized and federated approach to data governance, data management and data pipelines which addresses the topic of legacy data silos and interoperability.</p>



<p>CORD Blockchain sandboxes allow ISVs to design and deploy applications which follow the guidelines of Digital Public Goods (DPGs) on infrastructure that is aligned with the principles of DPI. The growing number of use cases, an uptick in the number of tenders and RFPs that mention blockchain as the preferred underlying infrastructure, and a better appreciation of the concept of reusable digital identifiers have contributed to the rapid adoption of Web 3.0 models. Together with empowering the data principals with more fine-grained control over the data, such an approach also brings in newer ideas in economic models around sustainable and scalable infrastructure.</p>

<p>My journey with Sunbird began in 2017 when we at the EkStep Foundation joined forces with the Ministry of Education (formerly MHRD) on the National Teacher Portal initiative. This initiative soon evolved into DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing), a national platform dedicated to enhancing school education in India.<br><br></p>



 The Vision Behind Sunbird 



<p>Sunbird was conceived as a collection of modular, configurable, and extendable building blocks designed to “share the ability to solve.” Think of it as a set of LEGO blocks or puzzle pieces that can be assembled in myriad combinations to foster innovative solutions within the educational ecosystem.</p>



<p>From the outset, we identified several essential building blocks that would form the backbone of any large-scale transformation. Among these were telemetry, knowledge graphs, data platforms, and crucially, registries and credentials. Our initial work on registries and credentials began as OpenSABER (Open Software Architecture for Building Electronic Registries), utilizing openbadges as a foundational element.</p>



<p>At the heart of it, the idea has been and remains, to enable attested sources of information with ownership for individual’s data in their control and credentialing (or badging) to make this data easily shareable and verifiable.</p>



<p>Registries form the seed of trust in any decentralized ecosystem and credentials empower an individual with control over their data, making it portable, verifiable, inclusive, trustworthy and accessible.<br><br></p>



 Empowering Individuals Through Data Ownership 



<p>At its core, Sunbird RC enables an attested source of information while granting individuals ownership and control over their data. This credentialing process—referred to as badging in the initial days—ensures that personal data is easily shareable and verifiable.</p>



<p>Registries serve as the seeds of trust in any decentralized ecosystem, while credentials empower individuals by giving them control over their data. This makes their information portable, verifiable, inclusive, trustworthy, and accessible to all.</p>



<p>Through the pandemic, as the eGov Foundation developed DIVOC for COVID vaccination management &amp; certification, the global efforts rapidly evolved standards around ‘verifiable credentials’. OpenSABER was re-branded as Sunbird RC (Registry and Credential).<br><br></p>



 Adapting to Change: The Impact of the Pandemic and Birth of Sunbird RC 



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the development of digital solutions, prompting the eGov Foundation to create DIVOC for managing vaccination records and certifications. During this period, global standards around ‘verifiable credentials’ rapidly evolved. As a result, OpenSABER was rebranded as Sunbird RC (Registry and Credential) to give a fresh boost of enthusiasm</p>



<p>Sunbird RC has emerged as a vital building block for establishing trusted registries and verifiable credentials across various domains. It powers other Digital Public Goods (DPGs) such as DIGIT, Inji, Sunbird Serve, and Sunbird ED. To date, it has facilitated billions of credentials and diverse registries across sectors like healthcare and education in India.</p>



<p>Sunbird RC offers microservices for credential issuance and management, enabling rapid deployment of electronic registries through configurable schemas. One standout feature is its ability to generate instantly verifiable credentials that can be accessed offline via printable QR codes.<br><br></p>



 Looking Ahead: Collaboration and Innovation 



<p>With the growing traction for credentialing systems globally across various use cases, Dhiway has joined Sunbird RC as a co-maintainer alongside the Centre for Open Societal Systems (COSS). Together, we aim to advance this project further by promoting adoption and enhancing innovations in digital identity, data registries, digital wallets, and credentialing systems.</p>



<p>Sunbird is an open-source collective seeded by the EkStep Foundation. The community has developed about 20 digital solutions—referred to as “building blocks”—that can be utilized individually or combined to create larger and more complex solutions.</p>



<p>I have had the pleasure of working with multiple community members from eGov Foundation, MOSIP, BMGF, some of the hyperscale cloud service providers such as AWS &amp; Google, a few large scale multinational IT companies, a bunch of start-ups, government ministries, and many open-source communities.</p>



<p>I am thrilled to continue my tryst with Sunbird RC and grow it together with the community, leveraging Dhiway team’s extensive experience in building and maintaining open-source projects.</p>

<p>Digital identity systems theoretically offer substantial improvements over the current identity status quo, including superior fraud prevention and enhanced user privacy. As the industry comes together around standards and system designs, we at SpruceID firmly believe user privacy must remain front and center.</p><p>One of the more challenging aspects of building digital identity is protecting users from surveillance. It’s always been possible to track Individuals through their movement and activities, in the real world and online. It is now quite common for digital data to be used to form profiles of Web users, and a poorly designed digital identity system risks replicating that pattern. This surveillance could happen by any number of legitimate (or not) entities, including commercial “data harvesters” or by ID issuers themselves, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we outline one effort to combat the risk of surveillance through digital identity systems, using a process known as Private Information Retrieval, or PIR. By using cryptography to obscure remote data queries, PIR can reduce identity-based surveillance and enhance user trust in digital identity.</p> When A Question Reveals Too Much <p>One strength of existing physical IDs, such as driver’s licenses, is their natural protection against surveillance. In most cases, someone checking the ID looks at it and verifies its authenticity and resemblance to the holder, and that’s the extent of information capture. There’s no call out to a separate system to verify the legitimacy of that ID, no records kept that you may be showing it quite frequently to a clerk at your local store, and no concerns raised about whether you’re buying a pint or a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s.&nbsp;</p><p>This sort of protection is more challenging in a digital system when there is an inherent tendency in technology to generate a robust event log for every transaction. A digital ID system with minimal privacy controls might<a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/credential-verification-offline-and-online?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> query a central server</a> for verification whenever your ID is checked and - accidentally or on purpose - create a detailed, real-time feed of your online and real-world activities. That data could have great value to the issuing authority and numerous bad actors, who will no doubt attempt to access that treasure trove of personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>The implications of abuse of a data set containing granular verified behavior of individuals is sobering. Governments could use it to surveil activists and journalists. Abuse and stalking victims could be tracked by their abusers. Even challengers in democratic elections could find themselves targeted by unethical incumbents abusing the system from within. One worrying example may have unfolded recently in China when a local government allegedly used data from a COVID app to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/business/china-code-protesters.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">lock down protestors worried about frozen bank assets</a>.</p><p>This is what’s known as a “phone home” problem in cybersecurity. Current standards for digital ID reduce this risk by storing <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com">an issuer’s digital signature</a> on a mobile device, where it can be verified locally rather than needing to query a server. This works much the same way as a hologram on a physical driver’s license, allowing it to be verified locally without generating a digital trail.</p><p>But there are still circumstances where remote identity queries are necessary. This creates a design problem for a privacy-preserving digital ID system: how do you query a database without the database being able to record the query?</p><p>The good news is that thanks to innovations in cryptography, it’s very feasible to ensure that digital identity systems don’t risk exposing users to surveillance, even when a verifier has to “phone home. "&nbsp;</p> Building Private Information Retrieval <p>A privacy-preserving database query needs to mask many kinds of information: the identity of the querier, the identity of the target of the query, what data is being checked, and the location of the query, for a start. At the same time, the data still needs to be restricted to a specific credential holder.&nbsp;</p><p>This is possible thanks to a process called “Private Information Retrieval,” or PIR. The nuances of PIR can be illustrated by a few hypothetical approaches to obscuring data retrieval. For instance, if a database query downloads an entire database, the server won’t know which specific record the query was after. Another brute-force approach involves keeping many separate copies of a database that can be queried at random, making it hard for any one copy’s controller to aggregate a full picture of any set of queries.</p><p>These aren’t very practical solutions, though. We believe there’s much more promise in a relatively recent addition to the PIR toolbox: <a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=932789&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">zero-knowledge proofs, or ZKPs</a>. Using cryptographic encoding, ZKPs transform data, such as an ID holder’s identity, so the data can be <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">confirmed without being revealed</a>.</p><p>ZKPs can serve several roles in protecting user privacy during a digital ID database query. First, a package of ZKP-protected data can affirm that a verifier, such as a law enforcement officer, has a right to query an identity database without revealing the verifier’s specific identity. The verifier would then submit the credential that must be verified, again protected by ZKP encoding. This encoded credential could then be checked for validity without revealing the credential holder’s private information.&nbsp;</p><p>This would make it far less possible to keep a record of useful information that could be used for surveillance—“someone from a trusted entity queried some sort of information from some database at some time”—which doesn’t really allow for Sherlock-level sleuthing. It’s this inability to even generate information that could be aggregated for exploitation that makes ZKP so enticing.&nbsp;</p> Communicating the Intent of Privacy <p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/18/key-findings-about-americans-and-data-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">71% of Americans now express concern</a> about government use of data. At SpruceID, we expect that holding and demonstrating strong privacy principles will be key to unlocking the acceptance and broad adoption of digital identities. Concepts like Private Information Retrieval should be a standard for any digital identity system, and that ZKP tech is a promising tool in that effort. </p><p>Industry practitioners should take lessons from the past 50 years of software development and build personal security and privacy into systems from the start. That’s not to say this work will be simple and seamless. Of course, it will undeniably be challenging not only to design and implement truly privacy-preserving digital identity systems but also to convince a skeptical public. Both will be necessary, though, to foster broad user adoption and make the full promise of digital identity a reality.</p><p>Visit our website to learn more about SpruceID's stance on privacy and how we protect digital ID users from phone home surveillance.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Robert MacDonald:<p></p>
 
<p>Hi everybody. Welcome to our blog. My name’s Rob MacDonald. I’m the VP of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and I’m joined by Vik today.</p>
<p>Vik, how you doing?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>I am doing great, yeah.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome.</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>And just for everyone, Vikram Subramanian. I run solutions for 1Kosmos.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. And you do a great job at it, Vik, by the way. Appreciate having you.</p>
<p>All right, Vik, listen. Today, I wanted to just have a short little vlog with you about Microsoft. Microsoft has released a new authentication, external authentication method, into its Entra ID platform. And the feature will allow more customers to expand their use of 1Kosmos’s identity-based authentication and passwordless access capabilities, and far more Microsoft and environments while maintaining all of the Conditional Access policies that they’ve built. 1Kosmos as an external authentication method will allow organizations to seamlessly protect Microsoft resources while also still protecting those platforms that fall outside of the Microsoft coverage.</p>
<p>All that to say, Vik, there are many use cases we can help fulfill to help improve an Entra ID investment. 1Kosmos as an external authentication method, while that is a new feature to Entra ID, what is it?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Good question. Many organizations obviously have invested in Entra, and I’m glad that both of us are actually getting that right. It’s not Ontra. It’s Entra.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It’s not Ontra. It’s Entra.</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>The main use case was that, hey, given that organizations are already invested in Entra, people are already authenticating in Entra and they’re probably using authenticators that are not necessarily complying to requirements that the enterprise has, or not necessarily having the experience that the enterprise has. It is a pretty big change if we tell people to actually move all of their authentication and utilize 1Kosmos as an IDP.</p>
<p>A great use case over here is, and we’ve always been asked by clients is, can we used 1Kosmos as an MFA within our Entra ecosystem? And now, with external authentication methods, we can. And what this provides is the ability for the enterprise to go ahead and introduce 1Kosmos to their end users and slowly start migrating them towards utilizing passwordless in its entirety.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Interesting, okay. That’s a lead into my next question, which is, with EAM, or external authentication methods, within Entra ID, how can one cause most help organizations within that kind of use case?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>A great use case is where organizations want to protect their crown jewels, so privileged assets, restricted assets, or restricted applications, restricted transactions. Anytime anything that requires an MFA, you can put 1Kosmos as the authenticator of choice within your Conditional Access policies. Earlier, you were not able to do this. It’s a great feature introduced by Microsoft, and we have immediately jumped and integrated with them utilizing that feature, which means now within the Conditional Access policy, you can select 1Kosmos as the authenticator for when certain conditions are met. And you can also specify what kind of authentication do you want the user to do. Do you want to depend on device biometrics or the superior Live ID that we offer?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. With this change to the way in which Microsoft’s offering their Entra ID solution, why is that important not only to organizations, but maybe the industry at large?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>See, now this is the increase or introduction of choice. Earlier, within the Microsoft ecosystem, the choices were very limited in terms of who were the authenticators you could use for doing MFA. And now, with the open ecosystem that has now been introduced, 1Kosmos can also be utilized by organizations. There are many organizations, many of our clients who are already investing in Entra, or have invested in Entra, could not leverage 1Kosmos without really making a huge organizational change and were stuck in their implementation. Now, this frees them up. They can utilize 1Kosmos as an MFA solution or as a passwordless solution. And it gives them choice.</p>
<p>And they can also utilize Conditional Access policies. That is very important. Why is Conditional Access policies important? Because everyone has it. Everyone is going to be using it. And now, you can also utilize that for Live ID.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. That’s amazing.</p>
<p>Vik, I appreciate you swinging by today and going through this quick use case with us on our vlog. I look forward to talking to you on our next one.</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely.</p>

 IDnow ebook reveals how the latest digital signature solutions can help unlock valuable business opportunities. 



<p>From symbols and pictographs, to ink and pen, signatures have been around for thousands of years, dating all the way back to 3000 B.C. Interestingly, the idea of digital signatures can be traced to the Wild West era when businesses used the dotted communications of Morse code and telegrams to sign contracts. </p>



<p>Fast forward to the 20th century, when in 1976 the first concept of a digital signature was introduced by cryptographers, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Today, compliant and fully digital signatures are integral to everyday business operations, securely facilitating contract signings worldwide, instantly accessible from any location, at any time.</p>



<p>As the world shifts from physical to electronic, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">digital signatures</a> will be essential in ensuring trust and authenticity in transactions. Digital signatures can streamline the process of signing contracts and enhance a company’s ability to verify, comply and protect digital identities, fortifying the trust needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.</p>

 Navigating the different types of digital signatures. 



<p>Much like a traditional wet ink signature, a digital signature serves as legal evidence when concluding a transaction. However, the advantages of digital signatures extend far beyond their physical counterparts. They are faster, entirely digital, and can be signed remotely from anywhere at any time, eliminating the need for signers to visit a physical location or branch.</p>



<p>This convenience not only streamlines the process but also enhances efficiency, making it easier and quicker to finalize important documents without the logistical challenges associated with physical signatures. Different types of digital signatures include:</p>



  Simple Electronic Signatures (SES), which can be as straightforward as typing a name or clicking an “I agree” button. They are versatile and accessible, making them ideal for everyday transactions. However, unlike Advanced Electronic Signatures and Qualified Electronic Signatures, an SES lacks strong authentication and data integrity measures. It is best suited for low-risk, informal agreements and may not be appropriate for high-value or legally sensitive transactions.  Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) uniquely identify and link the signer to the signature, ensuring it can be attributed to them. They meet legal requirements for court admissibility and comply with regulations like the EU’s eIDAS. While not as robust as a QES, an AES still offers significant legal weight and is recognized as a secure and reliable electronic signature in many jurisdictions.  Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) are highly secure digital signatures backed by a qualified certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority. This certificate meets stringent regulatory standards and links the signature to the signer’s verified identity, ensuring the highest level of legal recognition and security.  



 Embracing digital signatures. 



<p>The use of digital signatures has <a href="https://www.airslate.com/blog/airslate-looked-into-how-individuals-and-us-businesses-are-using-esignature-during-covid-19/?source=landing">risen by 50% since the COVID pandemic, according to airSlate</a>, with 69% of respondents continuing to use digital signatures due to their increased convenience and security.</p>



<p>This digital signing boom shows no signs of slowing, as the global digital economy continues to expand, with people increasingly living, working and transacting across borders, industries and use cases in this remote, digital landscape. Digital signatures, which combine remote, 24/7 convenience without compromising on security, are purpose-built for the digital world.</p>



<p>The increasing importance of digital signatures was put into the spotlight in July 2016, when the European Union (EU) issued the eIDAS regulation (electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services), which increased the significance of electronic signatures drastically. Digital signatures are therefore widely used in the EU for various purposes, primarily to ensure the authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of electronic documents and transactions.</p>



<p>For example, digital signatures are necessary and extremely important in the following situations:</p>



  Legal contracts and agreements: Digital signatures are used to sign legally binding contracts and agreements, including sales contracts, employment agreements and service contracts. They provide assurance that the signer has accepted the terms of the document.  Financial transactions: In the EU, digital signatures play a crucial role in financial transactions, including online banking, electronic fund transfers and digital payments. They help verify the identity of the parties involved and ensure the security of the transaction.  Regulatory compliance: Digital signatures are often required to comply with various EU regulations and directives, such as the eIDAS regulation which establishes a legal framework for electronic signatures, seals and time stamps.  



 The importance of the eIDAS Regulation. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS Regulation</a> (EU No 910/2014) stands as a cornerstone in Europe’s digital landscape, harmonizing rules for electronic identification and trust services across the European Single Market. It sets stringent standards for electronic signatures, notably <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">QES</a>, ensuring they carry equivalent legal weight to traditional handwritten signatures.</p>



<p>Crucially, eIDAS mandates mutual recognition of electronic identification methods between Member States, facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. This regulatory framework not only enhances security and trust in electronic communications but also promotes the digital economy’s growth by enabling secure and legally binding electronic transactions throughout the EU. This includes when an individual wants to sign a document with a QES and needs to be identified and verified for security purposes such as the following:</p>



  Identity verification: The identity of individuals must be verified before issuing a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. This can be done using automated methods but must meet high security and reliability standards. By putting these applications together, this guarantees that a high level of security and reliability is met when undergoing all types of document signing.  Remote identification: Automated processes for remote identity verification are permissible under eIDAS, but they must ensure the same level of assurance as physical presence verification. Techniques may include video identification, use of eID cards or other secure methods depending on the specific EU country and industry.  



 Unlocking the benefits of digital signatures – from security to sustainability. 



<p>From removing the friction and cost associated with manual processes, to preventing fraud and fueling growth, implementing digital signatures deliver a myriad of benefits, enabling businesses to:</p>



  Improve security: Digital signatures use cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of signed documents, making them highly secure and resistant to tampering or forgery. <a href="https://www.docusign.com/blog/the-bottom-line-e-signature-5-stats-every-cfo-should-know">Over 70% of users report fewer security and compliance incidents</a>.  Fight fraud: In recent years, the <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/transunion-report-finds-digital-fraud-attempts-spike-80-globally-from-pre-pandemic/">global volume of digital fraud attempts has increased by 80% according to TransUnion</a>. By using digital signatures, the identity of the sender is verified through a unique digital certificate that links the signature to the sender’s identity, making it difficult for fraudsters to impersonate or steal someone’s identity.  Enhance user experience: With digital signatures, <a href="https://www.docusign.com/blog/the-bottom-line-e-signature-5-stats-every-cfo-should-know">customer satisfaction is increased for more than 70% of users</a> as the friction and frustration experienced in physical signing is removed, giving an enhanced, more streamlined user experience.  Establish and build trust: <a href="https://drysign.exelatech.com/blog/10-e-signature-statistics-will-blow-your-mind">Organizations that have implemented digital signatures report a 500% increase in customer loyalty</a>. By ensuring the authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of digital documents and transactions, digital signatures reassure users that their communications and transactions are protected from tampering and fraud.  Cut costs: Without the need for printing, mailing and storing paper documents, <a href="https://www.docusign.com/blog/the-bottom-line-e-signature-5-stats-every-cfo-should-know">digital signatures reduce hard costs by an average of 56%</a>, creating a more efficient and cost-effective process.  Go green: By reducing paper usage and transportation associated with physical document signing, digital signatures help reduce the environmental impact of traditional paper-based processes and <a href="https://drysign.exelatech.com/blog/10-e-signature-statistics-will-blow-your-mind">could save up to 2.5 billion trees in less than 20 years</a>.  Achieve compliance: With <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/crime-areas/economic-crime/money-laundering">nearly €1.87 trillion of global GDP tainted by money laundering each year</a>, it is imperative for companies to meet all regulatory standards. Digital signatures, recognized as legally equivalent to handwritten signatures in many jurisdictions—including the EU’s eIDAS regulation and the US ESIGN Act—help businesses avoid fines and meet compliance requirements efficiently.  Boost conversions: With <a href="https://www.docusign.com/blog/the-bottom-line-e-signature-5-stats-every-cfo-should-know">users signing 79% of agreements within 24 hours</a>, digital signatures enable automated signing workflows, allowing documents to be routed, reviewed and signed electronically – streamlining business processes, reducing bottlenecks and accelerating decision-making.  Increase accountability: Digital signatures often include built-in audit trail capabilities, recording information such as the identity of the signer, the time and date of signing and any changes made to the document after signing. Because of this, <a href="https://drysign.exelatech.com/blog/10-e-signature-statistics-will-blow-your-mind">companies witness an 80% reduction in signing errors</a>, helping ensure accountability and transparency.  Scale and drive growth: Digital signatures can be used globally, making it easier to conduct business across borders and collaborate with partners, suppliers and customers in different locations. It comes as no surprise that <a href="https://drysign.exelatech.com/blog/10-e-signature-statistics-will-blow-your-mind">global e-sign transactions have risen from 89 million to 754 million in just over five years</a>.

				 <p>&nbsp; DPI — or Digital Public Infrastructure — is a new, white hot topic in development. In 2023, at a G20 meeting in New Delhi, India, DPI was <a href="https://www.sdg-digital.org/technical-enablers/data-sharing-models#:~:text=Digital%20public%20infrastructure%20is%20described,by%20applicable%20legal%20frameworks%20and"><br></a></p>
<p>“…a set of shared digital systems that are secure and interoperable, built on open technologies, to deliver equitable access to public and/or private services at a societal scale.”<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/digital-public-infrastructure#:~:text=Digital%20public%20infrastructure%2C%20or%20DPI,finance%2C%20health%2C%20and%20agriculture.">describe</a> DPI as:&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>“Like roads —&nbsp;a physical network essential for people to connect with each other and access a huge range of goods and services.”<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>In essence, how can governments invest in digital infrastructure that accelerates sustainable development —&nbsp;and what does that technology look like?<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
 A trusted information superhighway? 
<p>If you’re thinking that maybe we’ve been here before, you’re half right. The internet and the web that came to sit on top of it utterly transformed how we interact, access and share information, and engage in economic and other activities.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>But the internet and web evolved without a crucial element —&nbsp;a verification layer for people and organizations, which has led to widespread identity fraud, privacy concerns,&nbsp; and security breaches. So it’s not surprising to see digital identity systems being <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-examples-digital-public-infrastructure-maplworld-cwwpf">described</a> as “foundational to DPI.”<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>Simply put, you can’t create a thriving, inclusive, innovative digital economy if you can’t trust that the person or organization you’re interacting with online is who they claim to be. Similarly, people won’t trust systems that can’t protect their personal data, not least their biometric data.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>This is why decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials can be justifiably described as “game-changing” technology for DPI. Here, we explain three of the most important benefits&nbsp;</p>
 1. Seamless authentication and data sharing 
<p>Decentralized identity means that people or organizations or devices hold their own data in secure Verifiable Credentials in digital wallets on mobile devices.&nbsp; First, this eliminates the need for centrally storing personal or other valuable data in order for identity and verification to be managed. This removes a major security risk and provides data privacy. People can now consent to sharing their data. Companies and organizations are freed from onerous data privacy compliance.</p>
<p>Second, the source of a Verifiable Credential —&nbsp;the organization that issued —&nbsp;is always knowable. The data in the Verifiable Credential is digitally signed, which means that if someone tries to alter it, it will be automatically detected. Verifiable Credential data can be shared by creating a link or QR code from simple software on a mobile device and verified with simple software on the web or on a mobile device.<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>Add these all up and you have portable trust. You no longer have to engineer complex direct integrations to share data; and if you trust the source of the credential —&nbsp;say a bank, a business, or a government —&nbsp;you can act on the information instantly, because you know it hasn’t been altered.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"><br></a></p>
<p>Decentralized Identity means information from anywhere can be verified anywhere. If this seems abstract, think of it in the context of, say, India, which has 63 million micro industries. With Verifiable Credentials, each of these economic actors can authenticate who they are interacting with and share data that can be trusted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It gets better. By combining Verifiable Credentials with decentralized identifiers, people and organizations can authenticate and interact with each other directly, across secure communication channels (DIDComm). This communication protocol enables their mobile devices to take on the functionality of an API but with better security. Now they can integrate and use information in much more powerful ways.</p>
<p>Think of it as the capacity to create secure digital roads. These roads have no tolls. They are not owned by a platform, which means that the value created by digital interaction goes directly to those creating the value. These roads can be created from anyone to anyone, anywhere to anywhere.</p>
 2. Rescue biometric infrastructure from catastrophic failure 
<p>Biometrics are a powerful way to manage authentication: We bring our own, they don’t have to be remembered or constantly changed, and they’re fast to verify. For these reasons, they are being <a href="https://www.internationalairportreview.com/article/225603/how-biometrics-is-driving-innovation-in-airports-despite-legislative-restrictions/">rapidly adopted </a>everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But though biometrics are supposed to replace passwords, they, unavoidably, have replicated one of the critical architectural weaknesses of password authentication: centralized storage. In order to verify a biometric template (essentially, a hash of a biometric), a verifying entity must store that template in a database.</p>
<p>Centralized storage has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-42575443">already led</a> to catastrophic security failures, and the factor that makes biometrics so powerful —&nbsp;their uniqueness — turns their theft into an existential risk: You can reset a password, you can’t reset yourself, biometrically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials make, these problems go away —&nbsp;giving you all the benefits of biometrics without the need for centralized storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: When a person’s biometric is first captured during identity assurance, the biometric template is also rendered and issued to them as a Verifiable Credential. This means that when a person presents for a biometric scan, they also present their biometric VC. The verifying entity compares the scan to the template in the credential.&nbsp; That’s it — all the benefits of biometric authentication without the need for centralized storage.</p>
<p>“Bring your own biometrics” also provides a way to deal with the problems of biometric fakery, whether using silicone masks or generative-AI “deepfakes.” By requesting a credential containing a biometric template, verifiers have a way to double check the person is who they really are.</p>
 3. Decentralized governance 
<p>In creating Digital Public Infrastructure for people to authenticate and share data, it is impossible to know in advance every possible way they will use it to create value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized Ecosystem Governance is a simple way for the entity responsible for each use case to implement the governance rules it needs for its roads work and be accountable to its users (e.g., which credential issuers can be trusted, what information flows are needed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way of implementing governance (through machine-readable files that are propagated to each participant’s credential software) has the information-handling capacity to meet whatever variety the system throws at it, not least by virtue of localizing the governance decision-making and making it easy to implement changes based on feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, when we worked with the government of Aruba to implement Verifiable Credentials for Covid testing, the government needed to be able to rapidly change verification workflows based on new scientific information (e.g., test type, test validity times). Decentralized Ecosystem Governance was developed to meet this need. It has been developed into a full <a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-trust-establishment/">specification</a> for governance by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</p>
<p>As Digital Public Infrastructure, decentralized identity combined with decentralized governance gives people and entities the control they need to create frictionless ecosystems, the ability to rapidly respond to feedback, and clear accountability.</p>
 Lightweight and resilient 
<p>All these solutions can be implemented in a matter of weeks and without the eye-watering costs normally associated with infrastructure projects. That’s because Verifiable Credentials can work with rather than require replacing existing systems. And, because they are based on interoperable standards and open-source code, they can unify disparate systems.</p>
<p>This effectively makes decentralized identity a universal DPI layer for seamless authentication and data sharing, and one that can scale easily and start generating network effects rapidly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not every version of decentralized identity delivers the best possible combination of benefits.

<p>The arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglp0xny3eo">platform’s subsequent decision to provide user data</a> to authorities has sparked widespread concern, not just among privacy advocates but also in political dissident communities. This moment marks a critical turning point in the ongoing debate about balancing privacy and regulation in digital spaces. But beyond Telegram’s headlines lies a broader narrative — one about centralized platforms, their vulnerabilities, and the growing urgency for decentralization and self-sovereign identity.</p> The Fallout of Durov’s&nbsp;Arrest <p>As reported recently, Durov’s arrest at a Paris airport and the criminal charges he now faces have cast a spotlight on the inherent risks of centralized platforms. Telegram, which has been lauded as a beacon for privacy and free speech, now finds itself caught between the demands of law enforcement and the privacy expectations of its nearly billion-strong user base.Telegram’s new policy — to hand over user data like IP addresses and phone numbers to authorities with valid legal requests — marks a significant shift. The app, once seen as a safe haven for political dissidents, journalists, and activists in oppressive regimes, is now under scrutiny. Critics question whether this change will make Telegram more susceptible to the influence of repressive governments, undermining the platform’s core mission of protecting user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>But Durov’s predicament is not just about Telegram. It’s a wake-up call for the entire digital ecosystem and a reminder of how centralized platforms are vulnerable to external pressures — from governments, corporations, or even internal mismanagement.</p> Centralization’s Fatal&nbsp;Flaw <p>As I previously discussed in my article, <a href="https://ont.io/news/1086/The-Telegram-CEOs-Arrest-Highlights-the-Urgent-Need-for-Decentralization-and-Privacy-Protections">“The Telegram CEO’s Arrest Highlights the Urgent Need for Decentralization and Privacy Protections,”</a> the key issue with centralized systems is their susceptibility to single points of failure. Whether it’s the CEO of a company being detained or a server being seized, centralized platforms are fragile by design. The arrest of Durov underscores how much risk is embedded in centralized models. When the figurehead or infrastructure of a platform is compromised, so too is the privacy and security of its entire user&nbsp;base.</p><p>Telegram’s decision to share user data highlights the thin line that centralized platforms walk. Their leadership can be coerced, their systems can be hacked, and their policies can be bent to serve the interests of governments, often at the expense of user privacy. This is where decentralization steps in as a necessary solution.</p> Decentralization: The Answer to Protecting Privacy <p>In contrast, decentralized systems are designed to be resistant to these kinds of pressures. As I explored in <a href="https://ont.io/news/1088/Decentralized-Identity-and-Reputation-Balancing-Freedom-and-Regulation-in-Digital-Platforms">“Decentralized Identity and Reputation: Balancing Freedom and Regulation in Digital Platforms,”</a> platforms built on decentralized frameworks lack a central authority that can be easily compromised or coerced. Instead, they rely on distributed networks that empower users with control over their data and communication.For instance, decentralized identity (DID) is a transformative technology that allows individuals to own and manage their identities across platforms without needing to rely on a centralized entity like Telegram. With DID, there’s no single point of failure; no CEO can be arrested, no server can be seized, and no government can force a handover of user data. Users control their own credentials, and privacy becomes a fundamental right, not a privilege that can be&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>The recent developments at Telegram highlight how critical it is to shift toward decentralized identity systems. When platforms have no central control, they also become inherently more resistant to censorship and government overreach. In an era where governments are increasingly using the guise of regulation to invade privacy, decentralized platforms are not just a better alternative — they are becoming a necessity.</p> Striking a Balance: Decentralization with Responsibility <p>Of course, decentralized systems are not without their challenges. As we’ve seen with platforms like Silk Road and Tornado Cash, the anonymity offered by decentralization can sometimes provide a haven for illegal activities. This tension between freedom and responsibility was a central theme in my article on decentralized identity and reputation systems. While decentralized platforms offer privacy and autonomy, they also need systems of accountability.</p><p>One potential solution lies in decentralized reputation systems, where users build a reputation based on their actions within the network. This could help decentralized platforms self-regulate, ensuring that while privacy is protected, bad actors are held accountable. Such systems would allow users to engage with decentralized platforms anonymously while maintaining a level of trust and integrity within the community.</p> The Bigger Picture: What Telegram’s Shift Means for the Future of&nbsp;Privacy <p>The policy change at Telegram, combined with the increasing governmental pressure on platforms like it, underscores an uncomfortable truth: centralized platforms can no longer guarantee privacy. Whether it’s through government demands or corporate policy shifts, the privacy of users on centralized systems is always at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>This is why the shift toward decentralization and self-sovereign identity is so crucial. The power to control personal data and communications needs to be in the hands of the users, not corporations or governments. Telegram’s recent actions should serve as a wake-up call for anyone concerned about their digital privacy. As we move forward, decentralized platforms and identity systems are not just desirable — they are essential to preserving our freedoms in the digital&nbsp;age.</p> Conclusion: A Call to Decentralize <p>The arrest of Pavel Durov and Telegram’s subsequent policy shift have set the stage for a larger conversation about the future of privacy and free speech. In a world where centralized platforms are increasingly vulnerable to government overreach, it’s clear that decentralization is the path&nbsp;forward.</p><p>If we want to maintain control over our digital lives, we must embrace the technologies that enable it — decentralized identity, staking, and reputation systems. As governments and corporations continue to tighten their grip on the internet, decentralization may be the only way to keep our digital freedoms&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Interested in learning more about decentralized identities and how they can revolutionize transparency in venture capital?

<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council recently updated their Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for protecting payment card data. The latest version, <a href="https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0_1.pdf">PCI DSS 4.0</a>, introduces more than 60 new or updated requirements, with new directives around passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) among the most consequential.</p>  
 What is PCI DSS 4.0?  
<p>First introduced in 2004, the PCI DSS guidelines apply to any organization that stores, processes or transmits cardholder data. To demonstrate PCI DSS compliance, organizations undergo assessment on all systems that interact with the cardholder environment.</p> 
<p>In March 2022, the Council announced PCI DSS version 4.0, providing guidelines that aim to better secure account holder and payment card data within today’s evolving cyberthreat landscape. Organizations are required to implement PCI DSS 4.0 guidelines in two phases. The first phase deadline was March 31, 2024 and included 13 new mandatory requirements. The next deadline is March 31, 2025, at which time another 51 new requirements, which were only recommendations in the first phase, become mandatory.</p> 
<p>While version 4.0 contains updates across the board, some of the most significant relate to strong authentication requirements, specifically password usage and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Weak forms of authentication leave organizations and data vulnerable to brute force attacks, credential phishing and multiple other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">password-related attacks</a>. Understanding these new requirements is key for PCI DSS compliance. We look at five critical areas as well as their potential impact for your business.</p> 
 1. PCI DSS 4.0 Password Requirements  
<p>One of the most significant updates in PCI DSS version 4 involves stricter specifications regarding passwords. Key PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements (sections 8.3.4-8.3.9) include:</p> 
  
  Length and Complexity: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and use special characters, uppercase, and lowercase letters.  
  Reset and Re-Use: Passwords need to be reset every 90 days. An exception is made if continuous, risk-based authentication is used, where the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access is automatically determined accordingly.  
  Limited Login Attempts: According to PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements, after a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users should be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means.  
  
 Potential impact of the PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements  
<p>Longer passwords are more onerous for users and are more likely to be written down or insecurely saved in files on a device. Forced updates also tend to trigger unsafe user behaviors as people often make only minor changes that hackers are likely to guess. Moreover, all these requirements are likely to result in higher help desk calls. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Recent research from Forrester and HYPR</a> shows that the average help desk call costs organizations $42.50/call.</p> 
 2. MFA Required for All Access to the CDE  
<p>Under PCI DSS 3.2.1 guidelines, MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE). Under the new PCI DSS MFA rules (8.4.2), all access to the CDE must be gated by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>. The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers and endpoints.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication is defined as using two independent factors from the categories:</p> 
  
  Something you know, such as a password or passphrase.&nbsp;  
  Something you have, such as a token device or smart card.&nbsp;  
  &nbsp;Something you are, such as a biometric element&nbsp;  
  
<p>In its guidance on authentication factors, Version 4.0 specifically says to look at <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/fast-identity-online">FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)</a> for the use of&nbsp; tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors. While it stops short of requiring FIDO-based factors, some of its other guidance, as you will see below, points to a clear preference.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>The new regulations make clear that multi-factor authentication must be used every time the CDE is accessed, even if a user already used MFA to authenticate into the network under the remote access requirements (see below). This will add significant friction for workers, with potential consequences for both productivity and employee satisfaction. Moreover, most organizations, even if they already use some form of MFA, do not have the correct technology or systems to address the requirement for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktops</a>, workstations and servers.</p> 
 3. PCI DSS Now Requires MFA for All Remote Access  
<p>Previously, MFA was required for remote access to the cardholder data environment. With this updated PCI DSS MFA guidance, anyone logging in from outside your secured network perimeter, even if they are not actually accessing the CDE, must use multi-factor authentication. This includes all employees, both users and administrators, and all third parties and vendors. This also means that any web-based access must use MFA, even if used by employees on site.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>Effectively this means that all of your workforce that are remote, hybrid or have supporting roles outside the organization must use MFA at all times. It also means that any employee using a web-based application to access your networks and systems must use MFA, even if they are on site. In addition to the cost and IT burden of implementing MFA, cumbersome MFA procedures can negatively impact both employee productivity and satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 4. PCI DSS MFA Configuration Requirements  
<p>The new standard doesn’t just cover who must use MFA and when, it also introduces guidelines on how MFA systems must be configured to prevent misuse. Many traditional MFA solutions are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, push bombing and other attacks that bypass MFA controls. Requirement 8.5 specifies weaknesses and misconfigurations to assess for PCI compliance. These include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Your MFA system must not be susceptible to replay (aka man-in-the-middle) attacks.  
  MFA must not be able to be bypassed unless a specific exception is documented and authorized by management  
  Your MFA solution must use two different and independent factors for authentication  
  Access cannot be granted until all authentication factors are successful  
  
<p>As discussed earlier, the PCI DSS guidance on types of authentication factors makes reference to FIDO-based authentication. FIDO authentication is phishing-resistant, eliminates replay attacks and, depending on the FIDO solution, is inherently multi-factor.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your MFA solution uses SMS, OTPs or other insecure methods, it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 5. Strong Cryptographic Protocols  
<p>While earlier versions of PCI DSS required the use of strong cryptographic protocols to protect transactions and cardholder data, PCI DSS 4.0 extends the cryptographic requirement. With the new rules, any stored sensitive authentication data (SAD) must be encrypted using strong cryptography.&nbsp;</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your authentication system doesn’t properly encrypt and securely store authentication data, then it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 PCI DSS Section 8.3.3  
<p>It's worthwhile to call out another critical provision of PCI DSS, which though not new, is receiving renewed attention. Section 8.3.3 (previously section 8.2.2) mandates that the user identity is verified before modifying any authentication factor. This is intended to prevent social engineering attacks that target the credential reset / account recovery process.&nbsp;</p>

 Meet PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance With HYPR  
<p>The new PCI DSS framework now aligns much more closely with the NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, guidance from CISA and the OMB, and other regulatory agencies that urge the adoption of FIDO-based phishing-resistant MFA and a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> approach.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-pci-dss-compliance">HYPR helps organizations comply with PCI DSS</a> MFA requirements as well as multiple other provisions included in the standard. HYPR replaces the traditional password-based approach with secure passwordless authentication that is certified by FIDO and based on passkeys. Core elements of the solution, such as the incorporation of biometric authentication, possession of a trusted device, and cryptographic tokens securely stored on the device TPM or secure enclave, ensure strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication that meets PCI DSS requirements. HYPR also provides secure self-service methods to verify identity for account recovery.</p> 
<p>At the same time, HYPR greatly improves the user experience, eliminating the need for long, complex passwords and streamlining multi-factor authentication to a single user gesture.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>LUXEMBOURG, 24th September 2024 – AMA-AMBIOGEO, a pioneering mining Joint Venture (JV) with a focus on sustainable resource management, announces the tokenization of $4.6 billion in gold reserves, using <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny’s</a> technology to transform previously inaccessible real-world assets (RWA) into tradable and compliant digital securities.</p>
<p>The JV between <a href="https://theamaresources.com/">AMA Resources</a> and <a href="https://ambiogeo.com.br/">AMBIOGEO</a> adds up 70 years of mining experience and fuses the talent of people distributed worldwide to change the financial capability of miners in South America, becoming one of the largest and most important exploration companies in that region and standing out as a unique player in the natural resources sector.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theamaresources.com/investments">Supernova Project</a> is the inaugural venture in which AMA-AMBIOGEO has tokenized its gold reserves. This project combines two reserves located in northern Brazil: Supernova and Riacho Seco, holding a total of 474 metric tons of gold certified under the S-K 1300 standard, with an economic value of $36.8 billion at the time of tokenization. The discounted cash flow (DCF) or present value given to the asset was, however, 12.5% or $4.6 billion, accounting for extraction costs, current state of the mines and time value of money. The asset has been transferred to a Wyoming LLC of which its equity securities have been tokenized and are being promoted through a Private Placement offering under SEC Regulation D, Rule 506(c), and Regulation S for non-US investors.</p>
<p>AMA-AMBIOGEO’ sustainability model leverages tokenization to unlock the financial value of gold reserves while allowing most of the minerals to remain in the ground. By converting these reserves into digital securities, investors can own a stake without the need for physical extraction, preserving the environment and providing liquidity through fractional ownership.</p>

		 
	 
    Unlike owning physical gold or land, co-ownership of tokenized proven gold reserves offers a sustainable way to unlock value without extraction. Our goal is to modernize the mining industry through innovation and sustainability. Partnering with Tokeny, we’re bringing $4.6 billion in gold reserves onchain, offering a digital experience with features like self-custody, transferability, and collateralization, capabilities that were never before available to investors.  Ernesto BernadetCEO of AMA Resources    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny’s role as the technology provider for this innovative project ensures secure, compliant, and efficient tokenization, using the ERC-3643 standard to ensure compliance and interoperability. It lays the foundation for broad distribution in multiple marketplaces and future integration with DeFi platforms to enable innovative features yet to come.</p>

		 
	 
    Compliance is the backbone of RWA tokenization, and AMA-AMBIOGEO’s dedication to enforcing it onchain sets them apart. We’re proud to support their efforts with our onchain operating system, enabling them to issue, manage, and distribute permissioned ERC-3643 tokens that only qualified investors can access and trade, all while keeping the door open for DeFi innovation.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny

<p>Earlier this year, KuppingerCole published <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80890/securing-tomorrow-strategic-cybersecurity-recommendations-for-2024-2033">Strategic Cybersecurity Recommendations for 2024-2033</a>. Analysts at KuppingerCole conducted scenario-based research on the most critical trends, risks, and opportunities of the next ten years, which yielded the recommendations we present in the paper.</p>
<p>One of the recommendations we make is to know the opposition.</p>
 Know the Opposition 
<p>The paper identified a range of threats which must be first identified before effective mitigation action can be taken. Taken at a geopolitical level, different countries and regions will have different patterns of development over the next ten years, some taking more protectionist stances and others open and collaborative, with of course many varieties in between. These different environments foster different types of economic development... and crime.</p>
<p>Businesses operating in each environment must strive to understand the malicious actors that thrive in that environment, as well as their motivations. Are the conditions right for lone wolf attacks, state-sponsored attacks, or even corporate-on-corporate attacks? Are they seeking financial gain, disruption, or influence? The answers to these questions should help shape a unique defense strategy.</p>
 How to Know 
<p>Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) must know the opposition and should seek to do so by understanding the environment and context that cause malicious actors to attack. There are of course many ways to do this. We recommend having <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/ibm-c-toc-blog">incident response</a> plan(s) that address the evolving threats and threat actors, and scenario planning the threats that are particular to your region, industry, and business.</p>
<p>One place to do that is at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">cyberevolution in Frankfurt, Germany</a> in December this year. There is a track on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/1049">understanding the opposition</a>, covering quantum threats, threat intelligence, business models behind common attacks, and much more. Take proactive steps to understand the threats by joining the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/tickets">cyberevolution</a>.</p>

  <p>The traditional network security models are becoming increasingly ineffective in a world where remote work and cloud services are the norm. Conventional technologies like VPNs, while popular, offer limited protection in a boundary-less landscape, typically granting users excessive network access and posing significant risks. If compromised, these can lead to unauthorized access and potentially lateral movement within corporate networks, exposing sensitive data and resources. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> is at the forefront of addressing these challenges by effectively integrating identity and network access controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July we <a href="https://aka.ms/Blog-SSEGATechCommunity">announced</a> general availability of Microsoft Entra Suite, which brings together identity and network access controls to secure access to any cloud or on-premises application or resource from any location. We also <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution general availability. Microsoft Entra Private Access, a core component of Microsoft’s SSE solution, allows you to replace your VPN with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution to securely connect users to any private resource and application without exposing full network access to all resources. It’s built on Zero Trust principles to protect against cyber threats and mitigate lateral movement. Through Microsoft’s global private network, give your users a fast, seamless, edge-accelerated access experience that balances security with productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to all private applications, for users anywhere, with an identity centric ZTNA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modernize access to private applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the cloud’s growing dominance, you may still rely on on-premises infrastructure and use legacy VPNs to enable your remote workforce. Legacy VPNs typically grant excessive access to the entire network by making the remote user’s device part of your network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Legacy VPNs typically grant excessive access to the entire network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access helps you easily <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/microsoft-security/Its-Time-to-Move-Beyond-Traditional-VPNs">start retiring your legacy VPN</a> and level up to an identity-centric ZTNA solution that helps reduce your attack surface, mitigates lateral threat movement, and removes unnecessary operational complexity for your IT teams. Unlike traditional VPNs, Microsoft Entra Private Access protects access to your network for all your users— whether they are remote or local, and accessing any legacy, custom, modern, or private apps that are on-premises or on any cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Replace legacy VPN with an identity centric ZTNA solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Microsoft Entra Private Access enhances security for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions by enabling access without direct network connectivity. It leverages Conditional Access policies, including multifactor authentication (MFA), to validate both device and user identities. This ensures that only authenticated users with compliant devices can establish an RDP session on your network, providing a secure and seamless remote access experience. By integrating with Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Private Access validates access tokens and connects users to the appropriate private server, reinforcing the security posture without the need for traditional VPN solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Accelerate your journey to Zero Trust with Microsoft Entra Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access helps you accelerate your journey to ZTNA and meets this need by offering a streamlined approach to help enforce least privilege access to on-premises or private applications, reinforcing the importance of extending Zero Trust principles to any private app(s) or resource(s), regardless of their location — on-premises or any cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Accelerate your ZTNA journey with Microsoft Entra Private Access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, in more detail, are the key capabilities that help you move from legacy VPNs to ZTNA:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-quick-access">QuickAccess</a> policy simplifies transitioning from legacy VPNs to easily onboard with Microsoft Entra Private Access. It allows you to create network segments that can include multiple apps and resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access policy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, Private Application Discovery enables you to discover all your private apps, onboard them to enable segmented access, and simplify enabling the creation of Conditional Access policies for groups of apps based on business impact levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enforce Conditional Access across all private resources</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance your security posture and minimize the attack surface, it’s crucial to implement robust <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview">Conditional Access</a> controls, such as MFA (biometric and/or phish resistant), across all private resources and applications including legacy or proprietary applications that may not support modern identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The familiar Conditional Access policies used today can now be <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-target-resource-private-access-apps">extended to all private apps</a>, including legacy apps and non-web resources, such as RDP, SSH, SMB, SAP, or any other TCP- or UDP-based private application, resource, or network endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Enforce Conditional Access across all private resources</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access is applied to every network flow, ensuring comprehensive security coverage across all your private apps and resources—including <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/the-keys-to-the-kingdom-securing-your-devices-and-accounts-a925f8ad-af7e-40d8-9ce4-60ea1cac2ba4">MFA</a>, location-based security, advanced segmentation, and adaptive least-privilege access policies—without making any changes to your apps or resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deliver seamless access to private apps and resources with single sign-on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on">Single sign-on (SSO)</a> simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need to sign in to each private application individually. By enabling SSO, users gain seamless access to all necessary private applications, whether located on-premises or across various clouds, without the need for repeated authentication or modifications to existing apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access further streamlines this process by providing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-kerberos-sso">SSO for on-premises resources</a>, utilizing Kerberos for secure, ticket-based authentication. For an even more integrated experience, you can opt to implement Windows Hello for Business with cloud Kerberos trust, offering a modern, passwordless sign-on option for users. This cohesive approach to SSO, supported by Microsoft Entra Private Access, ensures a secure and efficient access management system for private resources across the enterprise landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploy across various platforms, ports, and protocols</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable secure connectivity to private resources from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client">Windows</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-android-client?tabs=device-administrator">Android</a>, with support for iOS and MacOS coming later this year, and Linux support to follow. This service spans all operating systems and accommodates any port and protocol, including SMB, RDP, FTP, SSH, SAP, printing, and all other TCP/UDP-based protocols. For security teams already using an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-proxy/">Application Proxy</a>, you can seamlessly and confidently transition to Microsoft Entra Private Access knowing that all existing use cases and access to existing private web applications will keep working with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securing just-in-time access to sensitive resources</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access tightly integrated with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure">Privileged Identity Management (PIM)</a>, a service within Microsoft Entra ID Governance, helps you secure just-in-time access to private resources for privileged users. This integration ensures that privileged access is granted only when necessary, aligning with the Zero Trust principle of least privilege access. It allows for the enforcement of robust Conditional Access controls such as MFA, to ensure that only eligible and validated users can access sensitive resources. This approach not only enhances security but also supports compliance and auditing requirements by providing detailed tracking and logging of privileged access requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to Azure managed services with Microsoft Entra Private Access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure offers many managed services, such as Azure SQL, Azure Storage, and Azure ML, among others. Microsoft Entra Private Access ensures a secure, private connection to Azure services while enforcing security policies and posture during access, allowing you enforce Conditional Access controls such as MFA and IP-based access controls. With comprehensive enforcement of identity and network access controls, Microsoft Entra Private Access ensures that managed services are accessed securely. Here are two key scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Secure Azure managed services access: Typically, Azure services are accessed over the internet. However, for security reasons, it’s preferable to keep the traffic between users or applications and Azure services private, avoiding exposure to the internet. This can be achieved through Microsoft Entra Private Access, where services like Azure Storage can be connected to a virtual network (vNet) using Private Link. This ensures that all traffic remains private, while additional identity and network access controls are enforced.</p>
 
 
<p>Figure 11: Enable secure access to Azure Storage with Private Access through Private Link</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Service endpoint for controlled access: In contrast to Private Link, the service endpoint method does not integrate services into a vNet. Instead, it restricts incoming traffic to connections from specified connector IP addresses through Microsoft Entra Private Access. This approach helps secure access to Azure services by permitting access solely through an approved path, where additional security measures like MFA and device posture can be enforced.</p>
 
 
<p>Figure 12: Ensures a single, secure path to the Azure managed services through Microsoft Entra Private Access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplify Microsoft Entra private network connector&nbsp; deployment for your private workloads</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-connectors">Microsoft Entra private network connector</a> is a required software component to enable Microsoft Entra Private Access. It sits alongside customers’ private applications in customer network and is designed to provide secure and convenient access to them from any device and location. It acts as a bridge between Microsoft’s SSE edge and application servers, facilitating the authentication, authorization, and encryption of traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable edge accelerated Zero Trust private domain name resolution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access enhances your organization’s domain name resolution (DNS) capabilities and simplifies the process of accessing IP-based app segments and private resources using FQDNs, allowing your users to access private resources with single label names or hostnames without complex configurations. With accelerated DNS at Microsoft’s SSE edge , DNS responses are cached, leading to significantly faster resolution times and enhanced performance. Moreover, the integration of DNS with Conditional Access adds an extra layer of identity-centric security controls, allowing for more granular control over access to private resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, with Private DNS support, you can provide your domain suffixes to simplify Zero Trust access to private apps using FQDNs, streamlining the connection process to internal resources, while using your existing DNS deployments. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where your users need to seamlessly access private resources without the need for VPNs or domain-joined devices, while offering a more secure and efficient way to manage access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplify access and improve end user experience at a global scale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhance user productivity by leveraging Microsoft’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">vast global edge presence</a>, providing fast and easy access to private apps and resources—located on-premises, on private data centers, and across any cloud. Users benefit from optimized traffic routing through the closest worldwide Point of Presence (PoP), reducing latency for a consistently swift hybrid work experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploy side-by-side with third-party network access solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of Microsoft’s SSE solution is its built-in compatibility with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-cisco-coexistence#configuration-overview">third-party network access solutions</a> where it allows you only acquire the traffic you need to send to Microsoft’s SSE edges. Leverage Microsoft and third-party network access solutions in a unified environment to harness a robust set of capabilities from both solutions to accelerate your Zero Trust journey. The flexible deployment options by Microsoft’s SSE solution empowers you with enhanced security and seamless connectivity for optimal user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplifying and securing access for your hybrid workforce is crucial in a landscape where traditional boundaries have dissolved. Enforcing least-privilege access and minimizing reliance on legacy tools like VPNs are essential steps in reducing risk and mitigating sophisticated cyberattacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access helps you secure access to all your private apps and resources for users anywhere with an identity-centric ZTNA solution. It allows you to replace your legacy VPN with ZTNA to securely connect users to any private resource and application without exposing full network access to all resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unified approach across identity and network access within Microsoft’s SSE solution signifies a new era of network security. This approach ensures that only authorized users are authenticated, and their devices are compliant before accessing private resources.</p>

<p>The world is in the early stages of supplementing old-school paper identity documents with digitally secured identification, licensing, and other credentials. This major technological and infrastructure shift offers big benefits in privacy, security, and convenience for everyday people.</p><p>Digital identity has the potential to vastly improve your control over your personal data. Already, many verifiable digital credential (VDC) formats support a feature known as “selective disclosure,” which lets users choose exactly what data fields they hand over during a verification.&nbsp;</p><p>We can go even further to give users broader, long-term control over data sharing of their information, including the ability to closely monitor who has permission to use it–and even to exercise their right to have their data deleted with the tap of a button.</p><p>For example, millions of Americans today spend countless hours on phone calls and dust off the fax machines to send information across primary care physicians and healthcare specialists. We could vastly improve the efficiency of electronic health record systems and the patient experience by describing handling rules for a patient’s protected health information (PHI) in human and machine-readable format called a “personal data license,” which is digitally signed by the patient.</p><p>A blood test result, for instance, is shared to a patient’s primary care physician (PCP) along with a new personal data license, which describes that the test results may be stored for up to 5 years across all entities and is shareable with their cardiologist without the patient needing to fill out any additional forms.</p><p>After 5 years, or when the patient decides to revoke the personal data license with a tap in their app, the data would need to be deleted under the HIPAA privacy framework. The patient could also update the personal data license to allow for other counterparties to also receive the data, or extend the sharing duration. Depending on the reporting requirements described in the license, the patient could also track when, where, and to whom their PHI was shared further.</p><p>We call this kind of system “Personal Data Licensing,” and it can work not only with health records but also with digital identity, professional credentials, and anything of value that is paper or plastic today but will be digital tomorrow. Making it a reality will involve technology working hand in hand with privacy-focused public policy. </p><p>If you haven't already, subscribe to our blog to stay tuned for part 2 on this topic, where we will describe in detail how it works in practice.</p> <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/">Subscribe Now</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>
