   California Protected Areas Database in Datasette 
 I built this yesterday: it's a Datasette interface on top of the CPAD 2020 GIS database of protected areas in California maintained by GreenInfo Network. This was a useful excuse to build a GitHub Actions flow that builds a SpatiaLite database using my shapefile-to-sqlite tool, and I fixed a few bugs in my datasette-leaflet-geojson plugin as well.

  <p>This week I helped Natalie launch <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">Rocky Beaches</a>, shipped Datasette 0.48 and several releases of <code>datasette-graphql</code>, upgraded the CSRF protection for <code>datasette-upload-csvs</code> and figured out how to get a commit log of changes to my blog by backing up its database to a GitHub repository.</p>
 Rocky Beaches 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie</a> released the first version of <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">rockybeaches.com</a> this week. It's a site that helps you find places to go tidepooling (known as rockpooling in the UK) and figure out the best times to go based on low tide times.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I helped out with the backend for the site, mainly as an excuse to further explore the idea of using Datasette to power full websites (previously explored with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Nov/25/niche-museums/">Niche Museums</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">my TILs</a>).</p>
<p>The site uses a pattern I've been really enjoying: it's essentially a static dynamic site. Pages are dynamically rendered by Datasette using Jinja templates and a SQLite database, but the database itself is treated as a static asset: it's built at deploy time by <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a> and deployed (currently to <a href="https://www.vercel.com/">Vercel</a>) as a binary asset along with the code.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/scripts/build.sh">build script</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/simonw/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a> to load two YAML files - <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/data/places.yml">places.yml</a> and <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/data/stations.yml">stations.yml</a> - and create the <code>stations</code> and <code>places</code> database tables.</p>
<p>It then runs two custom Python scripts to fetch relevant data for those places from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> and the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/web_services_info.html">NOAA Tides &amp; Currents API</a>.</p>
<p>The data all ends up in the Datasette instance that powers the site - you can browse it at <a href="http://www.rockybeaches.com/data">www.rockybeaches.com/data</a> or interact with it using GraphQL API at <a href="http://www.rockybeaches.com/graphql">www.rockybeaches.com/graphql</a></p>
<p>The code is a little convoluted at the moment - I'm still iterating towards the best patterns for building websites like this using Datasette - but I'm very pleased with the productivity and performance that this approach produced.</p>
 Datasette 0.48 
<p>Highlights from <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-48">Datasette 0.48</a> release notes:</p>
 
 Datasette documentation now lives at <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">docs.datasette.io</a> 
 The <code>extra_template_vars</code>, <code>extra_css_urls</code>, <code>extra_js_urls</code> and <code>extra_body_script</code> plugin hooks now all accept the same arguments. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-extra-template-vars">extra_template_vars(template, database, table, columns, view_name, request, datasette)</a> for details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/939">#939</a>) 
 Those hooks now accept a new <code>columns</code> argument detailing the table columns that will be rendered on that page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/938">#938</a>) 
 
<p>I released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> that takes advantage of the new <code>columns</code> argument to only inject Leaflet maps JavaScript onto the page if the table being rendered includes latitude and longitude columns - previously the plugin would load extra code on pages that weren't going to render a map at all. That's now running on <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/">https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/</a>.</p>
 datasette-graphql 
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> for Rocky Beaches inspired me to add two new features:</p>
 
 A new <code>graphql()</code> Jinja custom template function that lets you execute custom GraphQL queries inside a Datasette template page - which turns out to be a pretty elegant way for the template to load exactly the data that it needs in order to render the page. Here's <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/70039f18b3d3823a4f069deca513e950a3aaba4f/templates/row-data-places.html#L29-L46">how Rocky Beaches uses that</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/50">Issue 50</a>. 
 Some of the iNaturalist data that Rocky Beaches uses is stored as JSON data in text columns in SQLite - mainly because I was too lazy to model it out as tables. This was coming out of the GraphQL API as strings-containing-JSON, so I added a <code>json_columns</code> plugin configuration mechanism for turning those into Graphene <code>GenericScalar</code> fields - see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/53">issue 53</a> for details. 
 
<p>I also landed a big performance improvement. The plugin works by introspecting the database and generating a GraphQL schema that represents those tables, columns and views. For tables with a lot of tables this can get expensive, and the introspection was being run on every request.</p>
<p>I didn't want to require a server restart any time the schema changed, so I didn't want to cache the schema in-memory. Ideally it would be cached but the cache would become invalid any time the schema itself changed.</p>
<p>It turns out SQLite has a mechanism for this: the <code>PRAGMA schema_version</code> statement, which returns an integer version number that changes any time the underlying schema is changed (e.g. a table is added or modified).</p>
<p>I built a quick <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-schema-versions">datasette-schema-versions</a> plugin to try this feature out (in less than twenty minutes thanks to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/20/cookiecutter-plugins/">datasette-plugin cookiecutter template</a>) and prove to myself that it works. Then I built a caching mechanism for <code>datasette-graphql</code> that uses the current <code>schema_version</code> as the cache key. See <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/51">issue 51</a> for details.</p>
 asgi-csrf and datasette-upload-csvs 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">datasette-upload-csvs</a> is a Datasette plugin that adds a form for uploading CSV files and converting them to SQLite tables.</p>
<p>Datasette 0.44 <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#csrf-protection">added CSRF protection</a>, which broke the plugin. I fixed that this week, but it took some extra work because file uploads use the <code>multipart/form-data</code> HTTP mechanism and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf">asgi-csrf</a> library didn't support that.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf/issues/1">fixed that</a> this week, but the code was quite complicated. Since <code>asgi-csrf</code> is a security library I decided to aim for 100% code coverage, the first time I've done that for one of my projects.</p>
<p>I got there with the help of codecov.io and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/">pytest-cov</a>. I wrote up what I learned about those tools in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/pytest/pytest-code-coverage.md">a TIL</a>.</p>
 Backing up my blog database to a GitHub repository 
<p>I really like keeping content in a git repository (see Rocky Beaches and Niche Museums). Every content management system I've ever been has eventually desired revision control, and modeling that in a database and adding it to an existing project is always a huge pain.</p>
<p>I have 18 years of content on this blog. I want that backed up to git - and this week I realized I have the tools to do that already.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite">db-to-sqlite</a> is my tool for taking any SQL Alchemy supported database (so far tested with MySQL and PostgreSQL) and exporting it into a SQLite database.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-diffable">sqlite-diffable</a> is a very early stage tool I built last year. The idea is to dump a SQLite database out to disk in a way that is designed to work well with git diffs. Each table is dumped out as newline-delimited JSON, one row per line.</p>
<p>So... how about converting my blog's PostgreSQL database to SQLite, then dumping it to disk with <code>sqlite-diffable</code> and committing the result to a git repository? And then running that in a GitHub Action?</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/main/.github/workflows/backup.yml">the workflow</a>. It does exactly that, with a few extra steps: it only grabs a subset of my tables, and it redacts the <code>password</code> column from my <code>auth_user</code> table so that my hashed password isn't exposed in the backup.</p>
<p>I now have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/commits/main">a commit log</a> of changes to my blog's database!</p>
<p>I've set it to run nightly, but I can trigger it manually by clicking a button too.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://iapp.org/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a> (IAPP) has an open call for submissions for their IAPP Privacy Tech Vendor Report. The deadline for submission for the next report is Friday, August 21, 2020. You have 2 days left. Here are the <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/#guidelines">guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/59d51c960fc1400b96893e50554f91c8">submission form</a> for you to submit your entry for the report.</p>



<blockquote><p>IAPP has yet to recognize self-sovereign identity (SSI) as an independent category for privacy management.</p></blockquote>



<p>Don’t worry; the submission process is easy; you just have to fill out a few fields. It should only take a few minutes. </p>



  Company name  Company website  New or Existing Vendor  Location  Number of employees  Founded Year  Leadership (top executives, with full names and titles)  How is your organization is funded?  Privately held or Publicly traded  Best fit category (Activity monitoring, Assessment manager, Consent management, Data discovery, Data mapping, Data Subject Requests, De-identification, Enterprise communications, Incident response, Information privacy manager, or Website scanning)  100-word description  Logo and screenshot of tech solution  Contact name  Contact email address  



 About the IAPP 



<p>According to the IAPP “The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) is a resource for professionals who want to develop and advance their careers by helping their organizations successfully manage these risks and protect their data. In fact, we’re the world’s largest and most comprehensive global information privacy community.”</p>



 Why SSI Players Should Submit 



<p>The surveillance economy has gotten out of hand. </p>



<p>It is time to help privacy professionals and the establishment recognize that they can help their organizations successfully manage risks and protect data by putting identity and personal information and controls in the hands of the people, the data subjects, from which the data (inc. attribute data, labor data, and capitol data) are derived.  </p>



<p>The risks of identity and personal data mismanagement for organizations and individuals alike are no longer just a simple annoyance; the mismanagement and ineffective stewardship of identity and personal data can lead to meaningful lost opportunity and lasting emotional, financial,  social, professional, reputational, and physical harm for everyone. </p>



<p>SII solutions (in all their glory) are part of the answer: SSI players have the power to help organizations reduce risk and people to securely and safely collect, manage, gain insight from, and exchange their identities and personal information.</p>



<p>Empowering people with privacy is important. Privacy is the ability for an individual to control the who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose an entity can access and use their identity or personal information. </p>



<p>Most privacy tech does not help with this, SSI can. </p>



<blockquote><p>Individuals should have agency over their identity and personal information. </p></blockquote>



 Let’s get recognized by the IAPP and the industry at-large 



<p>Since the IAPP does not have an SSI category, I’d recommend that SSI players use the “Consent Management” and any other category they deem relevant to their product when making their submission. Remember, in your description, be sure to refer to your solution as being SSI related so as to help the IAPP connect the dots.</p>



<p>I have reached out to the IAPP and will be working with them to help them understand the importance of SSI “privacy technologies” and to recognize SSI as an independent category in future reports.</p>



<p>Please, be sure to submit your solution to this year’s report. If we get enough submissions, there is a chance that we can persuade the IAPP to carve our a specific SSI section in the next or future reports.</p>

  What you see there is a flammagenitus cloud rising to the north above Ranch 2, a wildfire about fifteen miles east of here in the San Gabriel Mountains, just north of Asuza (one of too many towns to remember, in greater Los Angeles).

<p>What you see there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammagenitus_(cloud)">flammagenitus cloud</a> rising to the north above <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6961/">Ranch 2</a>, a wildfire about fifteen miles east of here in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, just north of Asuza (one of too many towns to remember, in greater Los Angeles). If the video works, you’ll see how how the clouds give shape to the heat from the fire, even as smoke (darker and with a gray/magenta color) stopping at a lower elevation, spreads northward in the same direction.</p>
<p>The fire was caused by arson, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/person-of-interest-possibly-connected-to-1500-acre-blaze-in-azusa/2413265/">says the guy</a> who confessed to starting it.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how much reporting on fires has changed in the time I’ve been <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doc+searls+%23fire+inciweb&amp;ia=web">following stories like this</a> in Southern California. <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/">Inciweb</a>, the canonical close-to-live running catalog of wildfires in the U.S. has moved from the .org where it started to <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/">NCWG.gov</a>, the National Coordinating Wildfire Group. When I <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lets-do-news-what-we-did-software">first wrote about</a> Inciweb, back in ’06, I didn’t mention that it was entirely the heroic work of one Linux hacker at the Forest Service who didn’t wish to be identified.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to catch up on the Ranch2, one of <a href="https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/afm/data/activefiremaps/cgb2020230_1700.jpg">too many wildfires</a> clouding the western skies right now, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ranch2&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">here’s the Twitter search for the latest</a>.</p>

<p>It has been quite some time since I’ve been inspired to write. This is my first Medium story. What finally broke through the noise and my inertia was the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity&nbsp;Power</a>, an initiative released today by my friend Charisse.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Humanity Power message:<br>There is “unity” within humanity.</p></blockquote>



 Understanding the Humanity Power Message 



<p>What the message of Humanity Power teaches me is that through an understanding and respect for our humanity we can all come together regardless of ethnicity, age, skin color, religion, ability, sexual orientation, gender, class, social status, or national origin, to achieve greatness. In other words, it is through unity, and the mindful eradication of the “isms” in our lives — racism, sexism, ableism, ageism, colroism, classism, etc. — that we can be of service to each other, to ourselves, and strive to achieve, and maintain a world and a life filled with achievement, rich experiences and lessons, and most importantly gratitude and joy.</p>



  



<p>The concept of Humanity Power is hugely relevant to my passions and area of commercial and academic focus — the empowerment of people so that they can achieve digital sovereignty; so that they can achieve agency of their phygital self.</p>



<p>The message of Humanity Power is essential; understanding and embracing it is an important step toward our achieving digital sovereignty.</p>



<p>I invite you all to join me in spreading the Humanity Power message. I encourage you to think about the concept. Share it. Write about it. And, for you to buy Humanity Power t-shirts for yourself or as a gift for your family members, friends, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Humanity Power t-shirts are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.humanitypower.co/">www.humanitypower.co</a>&nbsp;for $25.00 + shipping. They are super comfy black tees with “unity” depicted in white, teal, orange, or rainbow text.</p>



<p>Let’s all work together to spread the message of unity through our humanity.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"></a></p><p>Firefox matters. The other major browsers are all subject to a larger corporation's business interests: Safari is built in the context of the App Store, Chrome must support Google's ad targeting business, and Edge fills a gap in the Windows ecosystem. But Firefox is here to fight for the users: it supports web standards and user privacy as public goods in their own right. <br><br>It also happens to be the best browser. It's the one I choose to make my default at home and at work, not for ideological reasons, but because it works the way I want it to. It's fast, private, functional, and more resource efficient.<br><br>Even if it wasn't, its existence would be important. In the same way that it's harmful for most people to get their news from Facebook, giving that corporation undue power over the flow of information that informs voters and underpins democratic society, it's dangerous for most of us to access the web through Chrome. In a world where so much of our lives are threaded through the web (particularly during the pandemic), giving one corporation control over the way the web works hands them the same kind of undue power.<br><br>And, of course, it's open source. Firefox is built in the open, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">using a community-driven approach</a>. That alone makes it unique among the big browsers.<br><br>Mozilla is one of the few unabashed forces for good in the tech industry, <a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future/">which is why the news that it had laid off a quarter of its workforce hit me hard</a>. It deserves our support.<br><br>But these two things can be true at once: Firefox is an important force for good, and it's a squandered opportunity that has not shown the way on the web as often as it should have. In service to Mozilla's desire to provide it for free - perhaps remembering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">the paid-for Netscape's loss to Microsoft's free Internet Explorer</a> long ago - it has been funded by a small handful of default search engine agreements. There has been no revenue innovation; very little feature innovation that would rock the boat of those lucrative agreements.<br><br>It seems odd for a privacy-aligned, community-driven web browser to be largely funded by targeted advertising. <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/strategy/business-strategy/pages/the-five-forces.aspx">It's also a textbook business risk</a>: all Google needs to do is withdraw its check, and Firefox is toast. Something more diversified and reliable is clearly needed.<br><br><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/">Mozilla's acquisition of Pocket</a> was a foot in the door for subscription revenue models. Its <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">new privacy-orientated VPN</a> -&nbsp; sadly not available on macOS yet - is an expansion of that strategy. But it's been executed far from perfectly, and an unanticipated revenue gap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/">was the declared reason for Mozilla's first layoff this year</a>, back in January.<br><br>I make a donation to <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">the Mozilla Foundation</a> every month, but I don't pay for Pocket (which I use every day) or the VPN product (which I can't use yet). I suspect many users are like me: we deeply appreciate Mozilla's work, but we're not that excited about the subscription products. Mozilla has done a bad job at targeting us: I'm not sure why it hasn't been possible to become a patron from within Firefox, or to pay an all-in Mozilla Subscription analogous to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">the rumored Apple One</a>, but I would have jumped on those chances.<br><br>Over the last few years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/01/guardian-breaks-even-helped-by-success-of-supporter-strategy">the Guardian has broken even because of reader patronage</a>. Unlike a paywalled site, where only subscribers could access content, readers like me pay to allow everyone to access its journalism. We do it because we find its existence valuable. Wikipedia is another organization that makes a patronage model work. Mozilla occupies a similar place in the world: a socially-positive organization with a minority of users who are affluent enough to pay for the rest, and will do so because they believe it's the right thing to do. There hasn't been a unified strategy to pursue this, but there should be.<br><br>There's no need to create a bazillion new revenue-generating products. A VPN is great, but there are lots of VPNs to choose from; a reading app is fine, but there are loads. There is only one community-driven vendor of privacy-preserving internet tools with a focus on keeping their users safe. Mozilla needs to focus on what it does best and do better at letting its community support it. We understand its importance, and we're here for it.<br><br><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/">You should install Firefox today.</a></p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 2 of 2: ID Is Only the Beginning.</blockquote> Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies <p>For many working with SSI and VCs, exchanging achievements is the top-of-mind use case. By achievements, I mean any kind: diplomas, degrees, certificates, skills, <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/report/the-new-geography-of-skills/">skill shapes</a>, competencies, badges, milestones, grades, awards, commendations, micro/incremental achievements, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Students will eventually share their achievements in pursuit of a job, but they also may want to transfer between schools, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/02/19/reverse-transfer-a-second-chance-at-a-first-degree/#3ecc67bc7bea">reverse transfer</a> credits from their current school to a former one. SSI and VCs are the ideal means of receiving achievements in a form where they can be readily shared again, and trustable without a manual verification process.</p><p>But unlike student ID, broadly useful achievements exchange among schools and employers not only requires them to become capable of issuing, holding, and verifying VCs, it also requires them to come to agreement about how the data payload should be arranged. This will happen, but it’s gonna take awhile. Thankfully, there is significant and growing momentum toward precisely that.</p><p>For example, serious efforts are underway at the <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a>, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in developing <a href="https://lerhub.org/g/bqCgme2fQxDbgJ6D7">Learning and Employment Records</a>, or LERs. LERs are powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/FeqEJI3S5KelmLv8XJss">learner wallet</a>” for simplicity. A learner wallet is the same as an SSI wallet, with one important addition: a learner wallet includes in its scope the capability for a student to store some VCs in a cloud-based container with a custodian, in place of or in addition to a local wallet, and retain self-sovereign control over them. This is useful with large data sets, infrequently used credentials, and as a backup, and is offered by the likes of ASU’s <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>An impressive piece was recently released that everyone interested in SSI for achievements should read, whether in the U.S. or abroad: <a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/9g21loK6RriHFkPRE4zJ">Applying Self-sovereign Identity Principles To Interoperable Learning Records</a>. My conclusion that’s relevant here: VCs are where “the puck is headed” for broad academic interoperability, they are the containers referred to in these documents that transport the LER “payload” between issuers and verifiers. By using this same technology for student ID, a school lays the foundation for later exchanging LERs.</p><p>Self-sovereign student ID does three critical things to prepare both schools and students for exchanging LERs and other achievements using&nbsp;VCs:</p>  It puts the tools necessary for exchanging achievements into schools’ and students’ hands.  It gets schools familiar with working with VCs: issuing, verifying, and managing.  It gets students familiar with using an SSI wallet: making connections, receiving VCs, sharing VCs, communicating, giving consent,&nbsp;etc.  <p>After self-sovereign student ID is in place, issuing an achievement or LER to a student means simply clicking a different button (or&nbsp;two).</p> The “Digital Experience” <p>Education is increasingly engaged in digital transformation, from enrollment to instruction to achievement and employment. Through all the schools, programs and other experiences you might have, there is one thing that’s constant: you. You are the ideal courier of your own data whenever it’s useful to prove or qualify for something, if only you could receive your data, have a way to hold it and present it, and it was verifiable when presented. That is precisely what this technology does.</p><p>When you realize that self-sovereign student ID is simply a school-issued digital VC held inside a secure wallet capable of also storing verifiable achievements, and that wallet ideally belongs to the student and not the school, it becomes clear how it can become foundational to a lifetime digital learning experience for that learner. In this context, the “Digital Student ID” becomes a part of the digital experience rather than the whole of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This also ties into the <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/network/institute-for-the-future-of-work/">future of work</a>, where lifelong achievements can be accumulated by the student and later used to prove skills and competencies to prospective employers at a granular level, with the power of selective disclosure enabling strong privacy to avoid oversharing.</p><p>Taken together, this is direct application of the “Internet of Education” from the <a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a vision that is now feasible and with which self-sovereign student ID is&nbsp;aligned.</p> Privileges, Perks, &amp;&nbsp;Freebies <p>Unlike typical digital credentials or even digital student ID, with self-sovereign student ID students can prove their ID and status anywhere, not just in school-approved or school-connected systems. This independence opens up the entire internet and the world itself, to embrace your school’s students as verifiably what they claim to be, and give them whatever benefits and privileges that status might conceivably afford. This could mean, at any non-school organization, online or&nbsp;off:</p>  Formless onboarding &amp; passwordless authentication at&nbsp;websites  Freebies, discounts and special deals&nbsp;anywhere  Access to students-only facilities and events from multiple&nbsp;schools  Access to special loans, grants, scholarships and&nbsp;more  <p>Intuitively, the more benefits you can arrange for your students, the more they will want to become your students; with self-sovereign student ID, you can unlock more benefits than ever&nbsp;before.</p> Communication &amp; Interaction <p>This category of capabilities is often overlooked in SSI, but I believe it could become the most used and beneficial class of capabilities that self-sovereign student ID enables. If you think about how much time we spend communicating versus how much time we spend authenticating, you’ll get where I’m coming&nbsp;from.</p><p>Before issuing a VC to a student, a direct connection must be established between the student’s chosen wallet and the school. This connection is unlike other connections the school may have with the student, and unlike the connections people have with each other; it is peer-to-peer, private, and encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>This connection between your school and student isn’t ephemeral; it persists until either side breaks it, even for alumni who’ve long since left the school (useful for helping keep track of grads for annual IPEDS and other accreditation reporting), It is a new, private, digital relationship between school and student that enables interactions of many forms: messages, phone calls, video calls, file exchange, playing games, taking polls, voting, gathering permission or consent (digitally signed by the student), granting the school’s consent (digitally signed by your school), and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A bit like email, both your school and the student can use different services to help with your/their end of the connection. And these services are substitutable; there is no single vendor in the middle that is connecting both sides, as there is with popular messaging services today. If there were, then self-sovereign independence is lost, and most of the benefits listed in this article along with it, replaced with dependence on that intermediary.</p><p>Using this capability, schools could do away with proprietary messaging systems they’ve installed to ensure <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>-protected data, for example, is not shared incorrectly, and instead use a standards-based system that comes for free with self-sovereign student&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This communication channel must be respected and not overused, because either side can choose to break it; it’s not like email or a phone number where the other party can simply resume sending messages from another address or device. Reconnection can happen at any time, but both parties must opt in. I particularly love this aspect of SSI, because it is the beginning of the end to spam and phishing, and encourages considerate communications behavior on all&nbsp;sides.</p> Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing <p>Once issued to the student by the school, self-sovereign student ID helps prevent <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/college-identity-theft-a-growing-problem-1947515">student-related fraud</a>, including with student AID programs the student may apply for with outside organizations, such as government, scholarship programs, and others. Once these organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information, bringing us closer to a world devoid of identity theft, where having someone’s personal information — even their passwords — is no longer sufficient to impersonate them.</p><p>When a student applies and presents their VCs for verification, the benefits offeror, such as FAFSA in the U.S., can instantly and digitally verify, either remotely or in person, the student’s ID and status as a student, even when the organization isn’t connected to the school’s systems. Eventually, as VCs become more prevalent and the student acquires more VCs as they progress in their learner journey, they’ll be able to prove things like their citizenship or visitor status, high school diploma, GED, academic progress, and more, further preventing fraud and accelerating the process of applying for student&nbsp;aid.</p><p>Of course this use case requires the benefits offeror to gain the ability to verify VCs, which they could do tomorrow, but in reality may take&nbsp;awhile.</p><p>Phishing attempts to impersonate the school in communications with the student can also be detected and prevented, by sending school communications through the private SSI connection or by using it to validate communications sent via other means. And the school isn’t the only one fraudsters may try to impersonate: faculty, staff, tutors, proctors, authorized partners, service providers and more can be strongly and mutually authenticated by using this same capability.</p> Why Not Embed An SSI Wallet Into Your School’s Existing&nbsp;App? <p>We hear questions about “embedded wallets” a lot, and for good reason: your school has worked hard to get your official app into as many hands as possible, so adding functionality to it makes sense, whereas asking students to get another ‘app’ — even though an SSI wallet isn’t really an app — seems almost a non-starter.</p><p>Well, if a self-sovereign ‘wallet’ were just another app, and intended solely for interacting with your school, this sentiment would make perfect sense. But it isn’t, so it doesn’t, at least in the longer term. But it might in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>We should unpack that a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>‘Wallet’ is a woefully inadequate term for what SSI is and does for a person; it is useful because it is an <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">easy to understand</a> metaphor for the most basic building blocks of SSI, but it is ultimately misleading, like mistaking the trunk of an elephant <a href="http://www.simoncamilleri.com/the_truth_of_the_elephant/">for a snake</a>. SSI is more like a self-sovereign cockpit for consolidating all your relationships, not just your academic ones, and certainly not just one school. SSI consolidates, under your ultimate control, your connections, communications, interactions, agreements, preferences and data, even data not in your physical possession like medical data, which might be best physically stored with a healthcare provider or other custodian. Leaving all that in bespoke, embedded wallets from each provider brings you right back to the status quo, with your relationships, interactions, and data spread out and under the ultimate control of third parties, with all that entails: vendor lock-in; privacy, security, and compliance issues; ID theft; surveillance capitalism; duplicate relationships and data;&nbsp;etc.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/own-your-identity">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/12/03/mastercard-microsoft-join-forces-to-advance-digital-identity-innovations/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity/networks">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-telcos-banks-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-mobile-authentication/">Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.culedger.com/">US Credit Union industry</a> and hundreds of others globally are now developing SSI/VC tech for use in many industries, so your school will soon not be the only entity offering SSI-powered benefits to your students, faculty and staff. Imagine if every organization embedded wallets into their own apps rather than working with an external one, or if every payment, ID, and loyalty card you carried required its own separate physical wallet… people would begin to get annoyed, to say the least, and prefer schools and organizations that made life easier, not&nbsp;harder.</p><p>All that said, an embedded wallet could be a reasonable tradeoff early on, when SSI is new and its first uses for your students may be limited to your school. So if you jump on self-sovereign student ID quickly as an early adopter, you could embed SSI/VC/wallet tech into your existing app, foregoing self-sovereignty for now without too much of a tradeoff, and still gain several of the key benefits mentioned. Then, as students, faculty, and staff begin to receive SSI connection requests and VC offers from their other relationships in life, and they start wanting to consolidate things, you can make moves toward greater self-sovereignty with less of a dilemma, counting on SSI’s standards-enabled portability.</p> What’s Ready&nbsp;Now?  What’s Ready   Code, Products, &amp; Services — Open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">code</a>; VC-oriented products from <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/ion-booting-up-the-network/ba-p/1441552">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://credentials.workday.com/docs/overview/">Workday</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM</a>, and dozens of startups.  Compatibility With Existing Federated ID — CAS, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock, etc. for connecting with SAML, OAuth, OIDC and other federation protocols for passwordless login, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/22/everybody-knows-how-knowledge-based-authentication-died/">KBA</a>-free call-in, and cardless walk-in authentication.  Standards Work — <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/participants">W3C</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>  Custodial Solutions — <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a>, <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>  Broad Consensus About VCs — The Verifiable Credential is the only <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">container</a> I’m consistently seeing under consideration for <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">transporting verifiable data between trust domains</a>, which self-sovereign control and trust require, from academia to healthcare to finance and&nbsp;beyond.  Broad Consensus About Individual Control of Data — From academia to healthcare to Europe’s GDPR and the current disdain for big tech and surveillance capitalism, I see broad consensus that control over data must move more and more into the hands of individuals, even data not in their physical possession.  Momentum — Years of global open-source development and standards work for SSI; orgs large and small in many industries are actively participating in developing VC code, standards, use cases and business models; strong support from the T3 Innovation Network in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   What’s Not Ready&nbsp;(Yet)   User Experience — The SSI space knows the basics — issue, hold, and verify VCs — but does not yet have the UX figured out. Honestly, the existing SSI wallets I’ve seen are all still a bit clunky and confusing (even though it’s still a much better experience than passwords or answering personal questions), but they do work. Usability must be smoothed and complexity hidden, and access for the disabled, older devices, and more, has yet to be addressed.  Interoperability — Today, standards are ahead of implementations. All the players know the importance of interop but haven’t gotten there yet, though there are serious multi-org testing and development efforts underway to get it resolved. I like the alignment of incentives here: any vendor not interoperable with others will be left on its own technology island.  Communications — While these private, peer-to-peer connections can support any kind of communication, so far I’ve not seen anything other than simple messaging.  Passive Authentication — I look forward to the day when I can be authenticated by those I know and trust passively, by policy, by automatically sharing the appropriate proofs when prompted, without touching my device. As far as I know, only active authentication is now&nbsp;offered.  Embedded Agents in Door Access Readers — Another missing element is embedded SSI agents into NFC (or other tap technology) readers, to make door access compatible and performant.  Ancillary &amp; Rainy Day Use Cases — Most new tech must first nail sunny day scenarios before tackling the rainy day ones. For example, VCs could be used for guardian relationships, children, pets, things, and complex organizational hierarchies, but those haven’t been done anywhere that I’m aware of. VCs could work off-line or from a QR code on a card or piece of paper, but no one has gone there yet either, to my knowledge.  <p>Considering what’s ready today, what’s not ready, the long list of benefits for both schools and students, the fraud with existing credentials, and the possibility of eliminating existing costs (see next section), I think it adds up to a compelling case that self-sovereign student ID is ready for piloting.</p><p>That said, the pieces that enable self-sovereign student ID are nascent and only recently available; it is a new application of SSI that itself has only been around for about four years, and mostly in the lab and not much in production, though that is changing. Schools considering this in 2020 would be the first, which for those that prefer to lead rather than follow makes for a wonderful opportunity, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>Cue the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">Technology Adoption Lifecycle</a>… welcome, Innovators!</p> Where to&nbsp;Begin <p>To get started with self-sovereign student ID, a school needs capabilities to issue and verify VCs, and students need wallets to hold&nbsp;them.</p><p>Code for simple issuance tools is available open source, more advanced tools are offered by various SSI service providers, and standards-compliant SSI wallets are available for free in both Apple and Google app stores. Verification is the tricky part, as it requires existing school systems to be adapted to accept VCs for authentication, and later for other purposes¹. Thankfully, some IAM systems commonly found in higher ed are adaptable now:</p><p>For schools running <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">CAS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, or any IAM system that facilitates an external Identity Provider, self-sovereign student ID can be integrated relatively painlessly, enabling students to immediately use it in place of passwords, and potentially eliminating the need for a dedicated 2FA provider. For contact centers running Salesforce Service Cloud, the StudentPass product that <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a> is developing will integrate natively, enabling students to use their VCs to authenticate when calling in, without answering personal questions.</p><p>Of course, integrations can be made with any existing system. Better to start a new identity project with self-sovereign student ID, which can begin to consolidate systems and reduce complexity, than build another layer that may well add to&nbsp;it.</p> In Conclusion <p>For those interested primarily in achievements, ID is an “and” and not an “or,” and it should come first, as it lays a technical and familiarity foundation for achievements to be issued and quickly useful. Communications could come soon after ID, because it becomes available as soon as the first connection with a student is&nbsp;created.</p><p>Achievements will come later, after the necessary consensus among schools and employers has been sorted to establish semantic meaning and interoperability for exchanged data payloads. Then this model — of people receiving, controlling, and sharing their achievements in a digital, verifiable form — will become the norm, and the future of work will become the&nbsp;present.</p><p>Until that day, schools can leap right past proprietary digital ID solutions and go straight to self-sovereign, and reap all its benefits without having to wait for anyone else to agree to anything, giving students a modern digital experience they’ll&nbsp;love.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-1-of-2-d3104ab0f8f2">Part 1: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</a></blockquote><p>¹ Down the road, VCs could also be used for authorization, where granular-level permissions and entitlements are carried and presented by individuals, simplifying the administration of centralized policy-based access control and moving enforcement to the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>Special thanks to several helpful reviewers, editors, and contributors: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnphillips11kps/">John Phillips</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Dr. Phil Windley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/longpd/">Phil Long</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-perry-1b7a254/">Scott Perry</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-m-smith/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinkelk/">Alan Davies</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taykendesign/">Taylor Kendal</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-hailstone-92a1a51/">Matthew Hailstone</a>.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 1 of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">2</a>: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</blockquote><p>Full Disclosure: The benefits discussed here apply to self-sovereign student ID generally and are not specific to any vendor or product; any standards-compliant SSI tools for issuance, holding, and verification could deliver these results. As a partner of venture studio <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>, I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a>, a startup now developing a self-sovereign student ID&nbsp;product.</p> TL;DR:   Digital student ID: doesn’t exist yet for most students.  Self-sovereign student ID: students independently store verifiable data, and strongly prove things about themselves anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.  Many uses: cryptographic authentication for passwordless login, KBA-free call in, &amp; cardless walk in; secure, keyless facility and systems access; prove skills, competencies and achievements; secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction; breakthrough fraud prevention; student-controlled privacy; digitally signed consent; and&nbsp;more.  Open standards: not tied to a specific vendor, usable outside the school’s&nbsp;network.  Schools can start with self-sovereign student ID today, without waiting for collaboration with or agreement from other institutions.  <p>Note: This article assumes a basic understanding of the concepts of <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The technical specifics of how VCs are issued, revoked, held, verified, and trustworthy are covered extensively across the SSI industry. Basic VC mechanics can be found in my other post: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a>.</p> Digital Student&nbsp;ID <p>For most students, digital student ID still doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>I’ve been asking experts in academia what comes to mind when I say “digital student ID,” and here is what I learned: other than login credentials for a student portal — which don’t count — a digital student ID still doesn’t exist, at least not for most students in most&nbsp;schools.</p><p>The first, still obscure attempts at what I would call real digital student ID have cropped up fairly recently, enabling students to prove their identity in multiple environments and granting them access to electronic systems, software, and even physical facilities. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities/">their version</a> of digital student ID that works exclusively with Apple software and devices, and various smaller companies have launched similarly proprietary software platforms with corresponding apps. Search “student ID” in the Apple or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%22student%20ID%22&amp;c=apps">Google app stores</a> and you’ll find dozens of similar offerings.</p><p>So why hasn’t digital student ID caught on? I think it’s because available offerings are tied to a single vendor, usable only in systems and facilities where that vendor is installed, and verifiable only by that vendor’s app. In Apple’s case it’s tied to their hardware, too. Even a homegrown digital student ID solution can be verified only by an associated homegrown app. It is vendor lock-in to the extreme, even if that ‘vendor’ is the school&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For a school to confidently roll out a more broadly useful digital student ID, it must be with technology that can traverse boundaries between vendors, both within the school’s network and external to it, such as when a student applies for aid. Such technology now exists, and it can do a heckuva lot more than&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Introducing a powerful new model for student ID: “self-sovereign” student&nbsp;ID.</p> Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <p>You may have heard of self-sovereign identity, or SSI¹. In this article I’ll explore how self-sovereign student ID can apply SSI capabilities and principles for students, faculty, and staff in an educational environment, primarily higher education.</p><p>I recognize that the term “self-sovereign” may not resonate as well with some in academia, which is often dominated by institutions preferring to expand their scope of control and influence, and perceiving self-sovereignty as a threat. However, it is the very act of giving greater control and independence to students that yields most of the benefits listed in this article, and counter intuitively, a closer, richer relationship with those students.</p><p>I’ll discuss this more in “Why Self-Sovereign” below.</p> What Is&nbsp;It? <p>The term “self-sovereign” is unfortunately not self-explanatory, but when properly understood should feel like a familiar analog to physical identity and credentials, which we already use in a self-sovereign manner well beyond the physical and digital bounds of the organization that issued them to&nbsp;us.</p><p>In short, self-sovereign student ID gives students the ability to independently and securely store tamper-resistant, verifiable data related to themselves, and to prove things wherever they want by privately sharing cryptographic (mathematical) proofs from that data, online or off. Importantly, it also enables students to securely, directly, and privately communicate and interact with the&nbsp;school.</p><p>Technically, the student has self-sovereign control over three²&nbsp;things:</p>  A standardized digital container, for holding verifiable data;  Peer-to-peer connections between their container and the containers of other people, organizations, and&nbsp;things³;  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that the student accepts into their wallet, and shares proofs of with others when&nbsp;desired.  <p>Today, that self-sovereign container is typically a standardized digital SSI “wallet”⁴ within a compliant app that the student can see and interact with on a smart device; eventually, wallets will be found anywhere digital things are stored and become part of the everyday life of people, organizations, and things, hidden and integrated into our devices and experiences in a way where we no longer notice or think of&nbsp;them.</p><p>One important point that will help readers better understand VCs, both in this document and generally: I believe VCs are misnamed, they are not credentials, they are verifiable containers capable of transporting any data payload, which may or may not be typically considered a “credential.” This means that VCs held in a wallet are containers within a larger container, but this is a feature, not a bug; it is how physical goods are transported in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> and is very useful. I’ve written about these points in greater detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.</p> Why Self-Sovereign? <p>Self-sovereignty implies giving students control over their data and how it’s shared. That may seem counter intuitive to the traditional academic notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis">in loco parentis</a>, but the truth is that it not only mirrors how physical student IDs work, it simplifies the IT integration work while expanding the possible use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Importantly, an SSI-based student ID binds the school-issued (and verifiable) information in the ID to a student’s right to use it. Through this binding, students can prove, at their own discretion, that they are enrolled, taking classes, receiving or received grades (and what they are), received a degree, and so on. Giving these facts to students in digital form can make their lives easier, reducing friction and fraud for both students and the school. ID is only one of many VCs that will be issued to the student by the school for various&nbsp;uses.</p><p>And once the student has an SSI wallet, it’s not just the school that can now exchange VCs with them. The student might want to connect and exchange VCs with multiple schools, their church, their gym club, their favorite sandwich shop or other entities they interact with. You might think that sounds like an Apple or Samsung wallet, and it kinda does,&nbsp;except:</p>  SSI wallets are portable between vendors, devices, and device types (ie, move from iPhone to Samsung and back&nbsp;again)  VCs are portable between&nbsp;wallets  VCs can hold any kind of data (ie, identity, location, degree, favorite&nbsp;pizza)  VCs are cryptographically verifiable  Holders can share only part of a VC, metadata about a VC, or just proof that they have one, without revealing anything&nbsp;else  The protocols that make wallets and VCs portable and interoperable are open and standardized  <p>And of course, Apple and Android wallets don’t enable persistent, encrypted connections with other people, organizations and things for secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction, but I’m getting ahead of&nbsp;myself…</p> A Thousand&nbsp;Uses <p>By “useful” I mean it can be used for many important, new, relevant purposes and also make expected and ordinary uses&nbsp;better.</p><p>I’ll organize the usefulness of self-sovereign student ID into six categories:</p>  Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access  Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies  The “Digital Experience”  Privileges, Perks &amp;&nbsp;Freebies  Communication &amp; Interaction  Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing  <p>The first category, Identity &amp; Access, will be covered within this Part 1 and is where I’ll delve the most deeply, with ten sub-sections. I’ll touch on the remaining five categories in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>Note: As mentioned above, it is outside the scope of this article to explain the basic mechanics of SSI and VC exchange, such as how the initial encrypted connections are offered and accepted, how VCs are offered and accepted using those connections, how VC presentation and verification occurs, or how those verifications can be trustworthy. Those subjects are covered amply by many other documents, papers, and websites throughout the SSI industry, and are the reason for the industry’s abundant standards activity. Refer to links at the beginning of this article for more information.</p> Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access <p>The primary use of self-sovereign student ID — and the gateway to limitless other uses — is as a digital, and therefore more powerful, version of a student ID card, enabling students to instantly and strongly prove their identity and status as a student, online or off, without passwords.</p> Password Replacement <p>Perhaps the simplest starting point for self-sovereign student ID is to replace passwords. Passwords have many known problems with both security and UX, and can be replaced with a quick ping to a student’s smartphone. The student responds with a tap, which cryptographically shares their school-issued ID, which is instantly verifiable by the&nbsp;school.</p><p>This is a big step-up in both security and user experience over passwords, and social login, and can be used in conjunction with or as a substitute for&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>For schools running CAS, Okta, or any ID system supportive of a “custom IDP” or “external authentication handler,” password replacement can be implemented quickly.</p> Identity+ <p>Self-sovereign student ID starts with a student-controlled wallet into which the school can issue VCs containing any kind of data, identity or otherwise. So typical student ID data — name, photo, ID number, etc. — can be supplemented with any other desired information: classes registered for or taken, status and authority as a student leader, entitlements, permissions, preferences, allergies, relationships to other students, contact information, family information, achievements (more on that below), and on and&nbsp;on.</p> Multi-Factor Authentication+ (MFA+) <p>The plus in MFA+ means the ability to exchange more factors than is feasible with current tech, while not impairing the user experience, and likely improving it.</p><p>Because shared secrets (something the student knows, like a username or password) are replaced with cryptographically secure, digitally signed VCs (something the student has, like a unique key), you can exchange much stronger credentials than passwords. Because they’re digital and easily shared, you can exchange more of them, even dozens. Biometrics, location and more can also be incorporated, either as payloads within VCs or in conjunction with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Because VCs can be exchanged actively or passively behind the scenes, they are useful within <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a> (ZTA). For higher-risk applications, multiple signatures can be required from multiple devices and/or multiple individuals. Combining MFA+, ZTA, and multi-device and multi-signature capabilities results in a formidable approach to protecting sensitive systems and facilities.</p> Vendor Independence <p>SSI is based on standards, so tools from different vendors can be interoperable. This means that your school isn’t locked into a single vendor, allowing competitive bids. Students, faculty, and staff can choose from multiple wallets to store their credentials, which are portable if they later decide to switch. You might use one vendor to help issue student IDs, another to integrate with the student information system for registration and transcript data, and a third to verify student or staff status at the campus bookstore POS. You don’t have to worry that any vendor selected for digital student IDs can’t support your diverse campus&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Use of student ID becomes no longer constrained digitally or physically by the boundaries of the school’s trust domain, or the presence of any particular vendor, removing what I believe is the #1 barrier for digital student ID adoption&nbsp;today.</p> Digital First, Then&nbsp;Physical <p>Self-sovereign student ID is digital first, but not digital only. With self-sovereign student ID you can have both digital and physical forms in several varieties.</p><p>A ‘smart’/chipped student ID card could hold an SSI wallet (note the irony) with some of a student’s VCs, greatly expanding the types of credentials, entitlements, tickets or other items the student can carry and benefit from, and making it much harder for a fraudster to get away with swapping out the name, photo, ID number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A student could also present a card or a paper with a QR code on it. Scanning the QR code could pull up a verified student ID, including a photo, either from a school-controlled database or from student-controlled storage. QR code-based verification could be restricted to authorized personnel, who could also be required to digitally prove their ID before gaining&nbsp;access.</p><p>Combining these capabilities, a school could issue a physical ID card with only three elements: a photo, a QR code, and an embedded chip— no name, no ID number, nothing else. If the chip and QR code worked as described above, even this extreme approach could be more useful than existing student ID cards while being more private for students and more difficult to hack for fraudsters.</p> Access+ <p>Whether for accessing digital systems, physical facilities or events, self-sovereign student ID can begin to support digital versions of key cards, vouchers, receipts and more, all uniquely associated with the student. A VC can also be issued as a bearer instrument not associated with any individual, like a movie ticket or a coupon. Using geofencing, students could be passively authenticated when entering a secure area, of course subject to their consent to the practice.</p> Mutual Authentication <p>Because it enables a bi-directional exchange of VCs, self-sovereign student ID may be the first technology that enables students to authenticate schools as strongly as schools authenticate students, preventing impersonation and phishing.</p> User Experience <p>Who doesn’t want fewer usernames and passwords to deal with? With self-sovereign student ID, the student can digitally present their ID and other entitlements and be authenticated more strongly, safely, and quickly than with usernames and passwords. This reduces the incidence of fraud, account take-over, and password reset requests.</p><p>Because the school maintains a secure, peer-to-peer connection with the student, it can use this connection to prompt the student for ID when the student calls in or walks in⁵. When calling in, this eliminates the need for knowledge-based authentication questions (birthday, mother’s maiden name, etc.) and speeds up the call; when walking in, this eliminates the need to pull out a physical student ID (useful during a pandemic).</p><p>Whether calling in, walking in, or logging in, a student can feel recognized by the school rather than repeatedly treated as a stranger.</p> Privacy &amp; Compliance <p>Today, when presenting a physical student ID card, the student divulges everything on it; there’s no way to present only part of it. With <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure</a> enabled by self-sovereign student ID, a student can share only the data required and nothing more, or prove something about their credentials without disclosing any of the data, or just prove that they have it. Some examples are&nbsp;helpful:</p>  Prove status as a currently enrolled student, without revealing name, ID number, or other personal&nbsp;info  Prove age is over a threshold, without revealing actual age or&nbsp;birthday  Prove address on file is within a certain area, city, or building, without revealing the exact&nbsp;location  <p>Selective disclosure is useful for many things, including voting, and can be used online or off. It affords whatever level of privacy the student desires, and satisfies both the spirit and the letter of aggressive privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, while remaining auditable for all interactions between students and the school. And by minimizing the presentation of identity to only the attributes needed, selective disclosure curtails the unchecked growth in the ‘grey market’ of personal data, worth billions of dollars and&nbsp;growing.</p><p>And when data is shared, it is shared directly by the student with digitally signed evidence that they did so, a veritable get-out-of-jail free card in today’s PII-sensitive privacy&nbsp;climate.</p> Consolidation &amp; Simplification <p>As it scales, federated ID has a tendency to grow into a complex, tangled web of identities, identifiers, vendors, integrations, synchronizations, and registries. Self-sovereign student ID can begin a process of consolidation around a coherent identity meta system, with a reduction in vendors, a reduction in identifiers, and an overall reduction in complexity, without consolidating around a single&nbsp;vendor.</p><p>And that’s not a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>That said, I’m taking the advice of my business partner, SSI pioneer <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/team-and-contact/">Dr. Sam Smith</a>, and avoiding diving into how this can occur within this piece. He is the better author for it anyway, as it quickly gets into a technical discussion about self-certifying identifiers, which SSI uses, versus administrative identifiers, which federated ID uses, which is his area of study and expertise. So, Sam can write a separate piece if there is sufficient interest. For readers having a pressing need related to this topic, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p> ID Is the Low-Hanging Fruit <p>For most, ID may be the best place to start with VCs. There’s far less complexity than something like achievements, and no other entities need to be consulted before adopting a particular approach; a school catches what it pitches. Plus, the benefits can be broadly and immediately felt, and readily integrated into most IAM systems. And of course, ID is a prerequisite for most other use cases; even if those feel more important or urgent, you usually need to begin by verifying who you’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>If you read no further, this should already be apparent: though ID and Access may be a fraction of what self-sovereign student ID can do, it is more than enough to justify serious consideration. The uses discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> are cool and exciting, but just icing on the&nbsp;cake.</p><p>If you’re not planning to read Part 2 and are wondering how to operationalize self-sovereign student ID, open <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> and skip down to “Where to&nbsp;Begin.”</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a></blockquote><p>¹ One of the earliest/best pieces about SSI, from Christopher Allen: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p><p>² Technically there is a fourth thing a student controls: self-certifying identifiers provide the root of trust, the crypto magic that makes it possible to traverse trust domain boundaries, but they’re “deeper under the hood” and out of scope for this piece.

<p></p><p>I've been worrying a lot about the United States Postal Service. This week we've seen <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wk9z/the-post-office-is-deactivating-mail-sorting-machines-ahead-of-the-election">sorting machines removed from post offices</a>; <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9967359/are-mailboxes-being-removed-streets-usps-reason">post boxes removed from Democratic-leaning areas of Republican-run states</a>; and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/13/donald-trump-usps-post-office-election-funding">the President of the United States openly admit he wants to defund the service in order to put postal voting in jeopardy</a>. All this in the middle of a pandemic, when the Democratic base <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/axios-coronavirus-perception/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">is more likely to be worried</a> (for very good reasons) about going to a polling place to vote.<br><br>I had a conversation the other day with a conservative who openly told me that democracy needed to be replaced. I don't know how many conversations like this are happening behind the scenes, away from other peoples' eyes, but I found it alarming to the core. It's not just that democracy is the declared defining value of this country, although it is; it's that we're so far past being able to find any kind of consensus that the conversation is turning away from it. The President himself isn't particularly subtle about his predilections. I have no doubt that there is a solid contingent of conservatives who would prefer to do away with democracy itself than allow Trump to be a one-term President, and I'm certain that Trump is among their number.<br><br>Perhaps - hopefully - this conversation was an outlier. The fact remains that our primary means for voting this November is being dismantled with very little outcry. The President's demonstrably false claims about mail voter fraud have been largely unchallenged. And in a year that saw <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/20/21328387/portland-protests-unmarked-arrest-trump-wold">unmarked federal officers</a> under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/top-dhs-officials-wolf-cuccinelli-are-not-legally-eligible-serve-their-current-roles-congressional-watchdog-agency-finds/">illegally-appointed leadership</a> wreak unchecked havoc on civil rights protests, not to mention the deadly <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/">mishandling of the nation's Covid-19 outbreak</a>, it's more important that citizens have their votes counted than ever.<br><br>What can we do?<br><br>First, if you're a citizen, <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2020-voter-info/">you need to make sure you're registered to vote</a>. Even if you think you are, it's worth checking, and it's worth doing the same for your loved ones.<br><br>Second, call your representative. Let them know that saving the post office is a priority for you. <a href="https://apwu.org/savepostoffice">The American Postal Workers Union has a great resource.</a><br><br>Third, and most importantly: vote. Vote your conscience, vote your ideals, but preferably, vote out this <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/fascist-tactics-trump-wisconsin/">anti-democratic, fascist administration</a>.<br><br>Fourth, be public about where you stand. Declare what you stand for. This year is not a good time for silence.<br><br>For the record, here's what I stand for:<br><br>I stand for socialized healthcare, free education, radical criminal justice reform, defunding the police, establishing a strong social safety net, bringing mass shootings to an end, solving the climate crisis, a democratic foreign policy, and a global, cosmopolitan, educated society where anyone can live well regardless of their background, ethnicity, orientation, or religion. A world where poverty is not a death sentence and everyone has the potential to do well - but nobody does badly. An end to the exploitation of the super-poor, and therefore the existence of the super-rich.<br><br>I stand for equal rights and opportunities for all, a guiding light based on compassion rather than capitalism, and an understanding that America is just one country on a very big planet.<br><br>I stand against concentration camps, border walls, unmarked federal forces curtailing the freedom to protest, theocracy,&nbsp; police brutality, American exceptionalism, traditional gender roles and "traditional values", corruption, racism, homophobia, sexism, capital punishment, privatized infrastructure, mass incarceration, and anti-intellectualism.

  Sqitch v0.9998: Now with Snowflake support, an improved Homebrew tap, and the quickest way to get started: the new [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/).

<p>I released <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> v<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998" title="App-Sqitch v0.9998">0.9998</a> this week. Despite the <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998/Changes" title="Sqitch v0.9998 Changes">long list of changes</a>,
only one new feature stands out: support for the <a href="https://www.snowflake.net/">Snowflake Data Warehouse</a>
platform. A major <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a> project aims to move all of our reporting data from
Postgres to Snowflake. I asked the team lead if they needed Sqitch support, and
they said something like, “Oh hell yes, that would save us months of
work!” Fortunately I had time to make it happen.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s SQL interface ably supports all the functionality required for
Sqitch; indeed, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/master/lib/App/Sqitch/Engine/snowflake.pm" title="App::Sqitch::Engine::snowflake">implementation</a> required fairly little customization. And
while I did report a number of issues and shortcomings to the Snowflake support
team, they always responded quickly and helpfully — sometimes revealing
undocumented workarounds to solve my problems. I requested that they be
documented.</p>
<p>The work turned out well. If you use Snowflake, consider managing your databases
with Sqitch. Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitchtutorial-snowflake" title="A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on Snowflake">the tutorial</a> to get a feel for it.</p>
 Bundle Up 
<p>Of course, you might find it a little tricky to get started. In addition to long
list of Perl dependencies, each database engines requires two external
resources: a command-line client and a driver library. For Snowflake, that means
the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/snowsql.html" title="SnowSQL Client for Snowflake">SnowSQL</a> client and the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/odbc.html" title="ODBC Driver for Snowflake">ODBC driver</a>. The PostgreSQL engine requires
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a> compiled with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq</a>. MySQL calls for the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html">mysql client</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> compiled with the MySQL connection library. And so on. You
likely don’t care what needs to be built and installed; you just want it to
work. Ideally install a binary and go.</p>
<p>I do, too. So I spent the a month or so building Sqitch bundling support, to
easily install all its Perl dependencies into a single directory for
distribution as a single package. It took a while because, sadly, Perl provides
no straightforward method to build such a feature without also bundling unneeded
libraries. I plan to write up the technical details soon; for now, just know
that I made it work. If you <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you’ll reap the benefits in your next
<code>brew install sqitch</code>.</p>
 Pour One Out 
<p>In fact, the bundling feature enabled a complete rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch">Sqitch Homebrew
tap</a>. Previously, Sqitch’s Homebrew formula installed the required modules in
Perl’s global include path. This pattern violated Homebrew best practices, which
prefer that all the dependencies for an app, aside from configuration, reside in
a single directory, or “cellar.”</p>
<p>The new formula follows this dictum, bundling Sqitch and its CPAN dependencies
into a nice, neat package. Moreover, it enables engine dependency selection at
build time. Gone are the separate <code>sqitch_$engine</code> formulas. Just pass the
requisite options when you build Sqitch:</p>
  <code>brew install sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-sqlite-support
</code>  <p>Include as many engines as you need (<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch#supported-database-engines" title="Sqitch Homebrew: Supported Database Engines">here’s the list</a>). Find yourself with only
Postgres support but now need Oracle, too? Just reinstall:</p>
  <code>export HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME
brew reinstall sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-oracle-support
</code>  <p>In fact, the old <code>sqitch_oracle</code> formula hasn’t worked in quite some time, but
the new <code>$HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable does the trick (provided
you <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos">disable SIP</a>; see <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/#--with-oracle-support" title="Sqitch Homebrew Oracle support">the instructions</a> for details).</p>
<p>I recently became a Homebrew user myself, and felt it important to make Sqitch
build “the right way”. I expect this formula to be more reliable and better
maintained going forward.</p>
<p>Still, despite its utility, Homebrew Sqitch lives up to its name: It downloads
and builds Sqitch from source. To attract newbies with a quick and easy method
to get started, we need something even simpler.</p>
 Dock of the Bae 
<p>Which brings me to the installer that excites me most: The new <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/" title="Sqitch on Docker Hub">Docker image</a>.
Curious about Sqitch and want to download and go? Use Docker? Try this:</p>
 <code>curl -L https://git.io/JJKCn -o sqitch &amp;&amp; chmod +x sqitch
./sqitch help
</code> <p>That’s it. On first run, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">the script</a> pulls down the Docker image, which
includes full support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite, and weighs in
at just 164 MB (54 MB compressed). Thereafter, it works just as if Sqitch was
locally-installed. It uses a few tricks to achieve this bit of magic:</p>
 
 It mounts the current directory, so it acts on the Sqitch project you
intend it to 
 It mounts your home directory, so it can read the usual configuration files 
 It syncs the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-environment" title="Environment variables recognized by Sqitch">environment variables</a> that Sqitch cares about 
 
<p>The script even syncs your username, full name, and host name, in case you
haven’t configured your name and email address with <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-config"><code>sqitch config</code></a>. The only
outwardly obvious difference is the editor:<a>1</a> If you add
a change and let the editor open, it launches <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org" title="Nano Text Editor">nano</a> rather than your preferred
editor. This limitation allows the image ot remain as small as possible.</p>
<p>I invested quite a lot of effort into the Docker image, to make it as small as
possible while maximizing out-of-the-box database engine support — without
foreclosing support for proprietary databases. To that end, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch" title="Sqitch Docker Packaging on GitHub">repository</a>
already contains <code>Dockerfile</code>s to support <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/oracle/" title="Sqitch Oracle Docker instructions">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/snowflake/" title="Sqitch Snowflake Docker instructions">Snowflake</a>: simply
download the required binary files, built the image, and push it to your private
registry. Then set <code>$SQITCH_IMAGE</code> to the image name to transparently run it
with the magic <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>.</p>
 Docker Docket 
<p>I plan to put more work into the Sqitch Docker repository over the next few
months. <a href="https://www.exasol.com/">Exasol</a> and <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> <code>Dockerfile</code>s come next. Beyond that, I envision
matrix of different images, one for each database engine, to minimize download
and runtime size for folx who need only one engine — especially for production
deployments. Adding <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine</a>-based images also tempts me; they’d be even
smaller, though unable to support most (all?) of the commercial database
engines. Still: tiny!</p>
<p>Container size obsession is a thing, right?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a>, we believe the future of app deployment and execution belongs to
containerization, particularly on Docker and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. I presume that
conviction will grant me time to work on these improvements.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well, that and connecting to a service on your
host machine is a little fussy. For example, to use Postgres on your local
host, you can’t connect to Unix sockets. The <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>
enables <a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/host/" title="Docker documentation: “Use host networking”">host networking</a>, so on Linux, at least, you should be able to
connect to <code>localhost</code> to deploy your changes. On <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Mac”">macOS</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Windows”">Windows</a>, use
the <code>host.docker.internal</code> host name. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>This week I've been working on making Datasette easier to install, plus wide-ranging improvements to the Datasette GraphQL plugin.</p>
 Datasette and Homebrew 
<p>Datasette is now part of the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> beta - which means the GitHub repository for the project now has a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions">Datasette discussions area</a>. I've been wanting to set up somewhere to talk about the project free of pressure to file issues or bug reports for a while, so I'm really excited to have this as a new community space.</p>
<p>One of the first threads there was about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions/921">Making Datasette easier to install</a>. This inspired me to finally take a look at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/335">issue #335</a> from July 2018 - "Package datasette for installation using homebrew".</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/saulpw/homebrew-vd">VisiData Homebrew Tap</a> as a starting point, along with Homebrew's <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Python-for-Formula-Authors">Python for Formula Authors</a> documentation. To cut a long story short, <code>brew install datasette</code> now works!</p>
<p>I wrote up some detailed notes on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew.md">Packaging a Python CLI tool for Homebrew</a>. I've also had my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils CLI tool</a> accepted into Homebrew, so you can now install that using <code>brew install sqlite-utils</code> as well.</p>
 datasette install, datasette uninstall 
<p>The updated <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html">Datasette installation instructions</a> now feature a range of different options: Homebrew, <code>pip</code>, <code>pipx</code> and Docker.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html">Datasette Plugins</a> need to be installed into the same Python environment as Datasette itself. If you installed Datasette using <code>pipx</code> or Homebrew figuring out which environment that is isn't particularly straight-forward.</p>
<p>So I added two new commands to Datasette (released in <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-47">Datasette 0.47</a>): <code>datasette install name-of-plugin</code> and <code>datasette uninstall name-of-plugin</code>. These are very thin wrappers around the underlying <code>pip</code>, but with the crucial improvement that they guarantee they'll run it in the correct environment. I derived another TIL from these on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/python/call-pip-programatically.md">How to call pip programatically from Python</a>.</p>
 datasette --get "/-/versions.json" 
<p>Part of writing a Homebrew package is defining <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew.md#implementing-the-test-block">a test block</a> that confirms that the packaged tool is working correctly.</p>
<p>I didn't want that test to have to start a Datasette web server just so it could execute an HTTP request and shut the server down again, so I added a new feature: <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#datasette-get">datasette --get</a>.</p>
<p>This is a mechanism that lets you execute a fake HTTP GET request against Datasette without starting the server, and outputs the result to the terminal.</p>
<p>This means that anything you can do with the Datasette JSON API is now available on the command-line as well!</p>
<p>I like piping the output to <code>jq</code> to get pretty-printed JSON:</p>
 <code>% datasette github.db --get \
    '/github/recent_releases.json?_shape=array&amp;_size=1' | jq
[
  {
    "rowid": 140912432,
    "repo": "https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils",
    "release": "https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases/tag/2.15",
    "date": "2020-08-10"
  }
]</code> 
 datasette-graphql improvements 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/">introduced datasette-graphql</a> last week. I shipped five new releases since then, incorporating feedback from GraphQL advocates on Twitter.</p>
<p>The most significant improvement: I've redesigned the filtering mechanism to be much more in line with GraphQL conventions. The old syntax looked like this:</p>
 <code>{
  repos(filters: ["license=apache-2.0", "stargazers_count__gt=10"]) {
    edges {
      node {
        full_name
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 
<p>This mirrored how Datasette's table page works (e.g. <a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/github/repos?license=apache-2.0&amp;stargazers_count__gt=10">repos?license=apache-2.0&amp;stargazers_count__gt=10</a>), but it's a pretty ugly hack.</p>
<p>The new syntax is much, much nicer:</p>
 <code>{
  repos(filter: {license: {eq: "apache-2.0"}, stargazers_count: {gt: 10}}) {
    edges {
      node {
        full_name
      }
    }
  }
}</code>

<p>The best part of this syntax is that the columns and operations are part of the GraphQL schema, which means tools like GraphiQL can provide auto-completion for them interactively as you type a query.</p>
<p>Another new feature: <code>tablename_row</code> can be used to return an individual row (actually the first matching item for its arguments). This is a convenient way to access rows by their primary key, since the primary key columns automatically become GraphQL arguments:</p>
 <code>{

<p>There are plenty more improvements to the plugin detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases">datasette-graphql changelog</a>.</p>
 Write-ahead logging in SQLite 
<p>SQLite's <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html">Write-Ahead Logging</a> feature improves concurrency by preventing writes from blocking reads. I was seeing the occasional "database is locked" error with my personal <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/dogsheep/">Dogsheep</a> so I decided to finally figure out how turn this on for a database.</p>
<p>The breakthrough realization for me (thanks to a question I asked <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/c4dbf6ca17">on the SQLite forum</a>) was that WAL mode is a characteristic of the database file itself. Once you've turned it on for the file, all future connections to that file will take advantage of it.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in a TIL: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/sqlite/enabling-wal-mode.md">Enabling WAL mode for SQLite database files</a>. I also embedded what I learned in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-15">sqlite-utils 2.15</a>, which now includes <code>sqlite-utils enable-wal file.db</code> and <code>sqlite-utils disable-wal file.db</code> commands (and accompanying Python API methods).</p>
 Datasette 0.46, with a security fix 
<p>Earlier this week I also released <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-46">Datasette 0.46</a>, with the key feature being a security fix relating to canned queries and CSRF protection.</p>
<p>I used GitHub's security advisory mechanism for this one: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-q6j3-c4wc-63vw">CSRF tokens leaked in URL by canned query form</a>. I've also included detailed information on the exploit (and the fix) in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/918">issue #918</a>.</p>
<p>Also new in 0.46: the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/-/allow-debug">/-/allow-debug tool</a>, which can be used to experiment with Datasette's <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#defining-permissions-with-allow-blocks">allow blocks</a> permissions mechanism.</p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    An earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a> proposed that we build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities—and discussed the nature of digital relationships in terms of their integrity, lifespan, and utility. You should read that post before this one. 
</p>

<p>
    In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/architecture-eats-culture-eats-strategy-925c7f3fb74b">Architecture Eats Culture Eats Strategy</a>, Tim Bouma makes the point that the old management chestnut <a href="https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/">Culture Eats Strategy</a> leaves open the question: how do we change the culture. Tim's point is that architecture (in the general sense) is the upstream predator to culture. Architecture is a powerful force that drives culture and therefore determines what strategies will succeed—or, more generally, what use cases are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Following on Tim's insight, my thesis is that identity systems are the foundational layer of our digital ecosystem and therefore the architecture of digital identity systems drives online culture and ultimately what we can do and what we can't. Specifically, since <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity systems are built to create and manage relationships</a>, their architecture deeply impacts the kinds of relationships they support. And the quality of those relationships determines whether or not we live effective lives in the digital sphere. 
</p>

 Administrative Identity Systems Create Anemic Relationships 

<p>
    I was the founder and CTO of iMall, an early, pioneering ecommerce tools vendor. As early as 1996 we determined that we not only needed a shopping cart that kept track of a shopper's purchases in a single session, but one that knew who the shopper was from visit to visit so we could keep the shopping cart and pre-fill forms with shipping and billing addresses. Consequently, we built an identity system. In the spirit of the early web, it was a one-off, written in Perl and storing personal data in Berkeley DB. We did hash the passwords—we weren't idiots1. 
</p>

<p>
    Early Web companies had a problem: we needed to know things about people and there was no reliable way for them to tell us who they were. So everyone built an identity system and thus began my and your journey to collecting thousands of identifiers as the Web expanded and every single site needed it's own way to know things about us.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems, as these kinds of identity systems are called, create a relationship between the organization operating the identity system and the people who are their customers, citizens, partners, and so on. They are, federation notwithstanding, largely self contained and put the administrator at the center as shown in Figure 1. This is their fundamental architecture. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative identity systems put the administrator at the center.   (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Administrative identity systems are owned. They are closed. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They provision and permission. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in. Fail to follow the company's terms of service? You could lose your account without recourse. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems use a simple schema, containing just the attributes that the administrator needs to serve their purposes and reduce risk. The problem I and others were solving back in the 90's was legibility2. Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. Identity systems make people legible in order to offer them continuity and convenience while reducing risk for the administrator. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems give rise to a systematic inequality in the relationships they manage. Administrative identity systems create bureaucratic cultures. Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Designers of administrative identity systems do the imaginative work of assigning identifiers, defining the administrative schemas and processes, and setting the purpose of the identity system and the relationships it engenders. Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative identity systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor" as <a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau2.2.007%22">David Graeber calls it</a> of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals.  Subjects have few tools for managing these relationship because each one is a little different, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience. Consequently, subjects have no way to operationalize the relationship except in whatever manner the administrator allows. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that the architecture of administrative identity systems gives rise to a bureaucratic culture, what kinds of strategies or capabilities does that culture engender? Quoting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy-ebook/dp/B00MKZ0QZ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=utopia+of+rules&amp;qid=1596487542&amp;sr=8-1">David Graeber from The Utopia of Rules (pg 152)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable, and—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I argue that this is the kind of thing the internet is best at. Our online relationships with ecommerce companies, social media providers, banks, and others are cold and impersonal, but also relatively efficient. In that sense, the web has kept its promise. But the institutionalized frame of action that has come to define it alienates its subjects in two ways:
</p>
 
     They are isolated and estranged from each other. 
     They surrender control over their online activity and the associated data within a given domain to the administrator of that domain.  
 

<p>
    The administrative architecture and the bureaucratic culture it creates has several unavoidable, regrettable outcomes:
</p>
 
     Anemic relationships that limit the capabilities of the systems they support. For example, social media platforms are designed to allow people to form a link (symmetrical or asymmetrical) to others online. But it is all done within the sphere of the administrative domain of the system provider. The relationships in these systems are like two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of the real relationships they mirror. We inhabit multiple walled gardens that no more reflect real life than do the walled gardens of amusement parks.
     
     A surveillance economy that relies on the weak privacy provisions that administrative systems create to exploit our online behavior as the raw material for products that not only predict, but attempt to manipulate, our future behaviors.3 Many administrative relationships are set up to harvest data about our online behavior. The administrator controls the nature of these relationships, what is allowed, and what is behavior is rewarded.
     
     Single points of failure where key parts of our lives are contained within the systems of companies that will inevitably cease to exist someday.  In the words of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">Craig Burton</a>: "It's about choice: freedom of choice vs. prescribed options. Leadership shifts. Policies expire. Companies fail. Systems decay. Give me the freedom of choice to minimize these hazards." 
 

 The Self-Sovereign Alternative 

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems</a> offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol. 
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Self-Sovereign Identity Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the self-sovereign identity stack. The bottom two layers, the Verifiable Data Repositories and the Peer-to-Peer Agents make up what we refer to as the Identity Metasystem. The features of the metasystem architecture are our primary interest. I have written extensively about the details of the architecture of the metasystem in other posts (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">The Sovrin SSI Stack</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Decentralized Identifiers</a>). 
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of the metasystem has several important features:
</p>
 
     
        Mediated by protocol—Instead of being intermediated by a intervening administrative authority, activities in the metasystem are mediated through peer-to-peer protocol. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale. Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Consequently, the metasystem supports a flexible set of interactions that can be adapted for many different contexts and needs.
     
     Heterarchical—Interactions in the metasystem are peer-to-peer rather than hierarchical. The are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">not just distributed, but decentralized</a>. Decentralization <a>enables autonomy and flexibility</a> and to assure its independence from the influence of any single actor. No centralized system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes.
     
     
        Consistent user experience—A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context.
     
     
        Polymorphic—The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. The content that an identity metasystem carries must be flexible enough to support many different situations. 
     
 

<p>
    These architectural features give rise to a culture that I describe as protocological. The protocological culture of the identity metasystem has the following properties:
</p>
 
     Open and permissionless—The metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a>: No one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Special care is taken to ensure that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/05/the_impact_of_a_network_of_networks_on_censorship.shtml">metasystem is censorship resistant</a> so that everyone has access. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
     
     <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—The metasystem allows allows people to act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
     
     Inclusive—Inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
     
     Flexible—The metasystem allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios.
     
     Modular—An identity metasystem can’t be a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, the metasystem will have interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
     
     Universal—Successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. An identity metasystem based on protocol will have network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that one organization will have control, it means that one protocol will mediate all interaction and everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it. 
     
 

 Supporting Authentic Relationships 
<p>
    Self-sovereign identity envisions digital life that cannot be supported with traditional identity architectures. The architecture of self-sovereign identity and the culture that springs from it support richer, more authentic relationships:
</p>

 
     Self-sovereign identity provides people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into.  
     Self-sovereign identity, through protocol, allows ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori. 
 
<p>
    The following subsections give examples for each of these.
</p>


 Disintermediating Platforms 
<p>
    Many real-world experiences have been successfully digitized, but the resulting intermediation opens us to exploitation despite the conveniences. We need digitized experiences that respect human dignity and don't leave us open to being exploited for some company's advantage.  As an example consider how the identity metasystem could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">disintermediates the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies have been very successful in intermediating these exchanges and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. 
</p>

<p>
    That's not to say platforms provide no value. The problem isn't that they charge for services, but that their intervening position gives them too much power to make markets and set prices. Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to participants: a means of discovering relevant service providers, a system to facilitate the transaction, and a trust framework to help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman puts it</a>. An identity metasystem supporting self-sovereign identity provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. Such a system with support for a token can even facilitate the transaction without anyone having an intervening position. 
</p>
<p>
    Disintermediating platforms requires creating a peer-to-peer marketplace on top of the metasystem. While the metasystem provides the means of creating and managing the peer-to-peer relationship, defining this marketplace requires determining the messages to be exchanged between participants and creating the means of discovery. These messages might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">exchanged using DIDComm</a>, or even ride on top of a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential exchange</a>. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, such a business might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define it's menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but the merchant could replace it with a similar service, providing competition, because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>
<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. Because these results are achieved through protocol, we do not need to create new regulations that stifle innovation and lock in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. And these systems preserve human dignity and autonomy by removing administrative authorities.
</p>


 Digitizing Auto Accidents 

<p>
    As an example of the the kinds of interactions that people have every day that are difficult to bring into the administrative sphere, consider the interactions that occur between various participants and their representatives following an auto accident. Because these interactions are ad hoc, large parts of our lives have yet to enjoy the convenience of being digitized. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I imagine a digital identity system that enables the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>In this scenario, two drivers, Alice and Bob, have had an accident. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials that will be necessary to create the report:</p>

 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title from the state 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in different states (potentially) 
     Driver's license, potentially from a different agencies than the one who registers cars and potentially in different states 
 

<p>In addition, the police officer has a credentials from the Highway Patrol, Alice and Bob will make and sign statements, and the police officer will create an accident report. What's more, the owners of the vehicles may not be the drivers. </p>

<p>
    Now imagine you're building a startup to solve the "car accident use case." You imagine a platform to relate to all these participants and intermediate the exchange of all this information. To have value, it has to do more than provide a way to exchange PDFs and most if not all of the participants have to be on it. The system has to make the information usable. How do you get all the various insurance companies, state agencies, to say nothing of the many body shops and hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance companies on board? And yet, these kinds of ad hoc interactions confront us daily.
</p>


 Taking our Rightful Place in the Digital Sphere 

<p>
    Devon Leffreto <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/07/relationship-structures-matter.html">said something recently</a> that made me think:
</p>
<blockquote>
    You do not have an accurate operational relationship with your Government.
</blockquote>
<p>
    My thought was "not just government". The key word is "operational". People don't have operational relationships anywhere online.4  We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Scenarios like the ones envisioned in the preceding section happen all the time in the physical world—in fact they're the norm. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. An identity metasystem provides people with the tools they need to be "embodied" in the digital world and act autonomously.
</p>

<p>
    Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we've failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of a metasystem to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The identity metasystem and the richer relationships that result from it promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.
</p>

 

 End Notes 
 
     Two of my friends at the time, Eric Thompson and Stacey Son were playing with FPGAs that could crack hashed passwords, so we were aware of the problems and did our best to mitigate them.  
     See Venkatesh Rao's <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">nice summary</a> of James C. Scott's seminal book on legibility and its unintended consequences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> for more on this idea.
      See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff for a detailed (705 page) exploration of this idea.  
     The one exception I can think of to this is email.  People act through email all the time in ways that aren't intermediated by their email provider. Again, it's a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/11/mozilla-layoffs">Daring Fireball has further links and commentary</a>, including that the layoff number is “about on-third of its workforce”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Firefox was very popular, and Google paid Mozilla a small fortune to make Google search the default in Firefox because it was so popular. But then came Chrome. Why should Google fund Mozilla when Chrome is about 10 times more popular than Firefox, other than out of the goodness of their heart?</p>

<p>It is a very good thing for the world and the web that a truly independent browser exists from a privacy-minded company, but there’s not much of a business model for it unless it’s popular enough to get the dominant search engine to pay for placement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Open Web, open source, Web3, global Internet commons infrastructure. Security. Privacy. Data ownership. We’ve got a lot on our plate that is looking pretty concerning.</p>

<p>I pretty much felt the same in the early 2000s, facing down FUD from Microsoft vs. open source. And we … won? Sort of? Except now it’s time to reboot again, because the ad supported web and big tech owned open source is an awkward place to have ended up.</p>

<p>I don’t know Chris Riley who just got laid off and tweeted this, but I’ll bold the key part here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s been a heck of a ride at @mozilla for the past 7 years. But this is where I get off the train too. I’m sad; I’m going to miss the people, a lot. For me, my calling to make the internet better will continue. I just need to find the right next venture for it. #MozillaLifeboat

<p>Shopify is an absolute massive ecosystem. Blending crowdfunding with straight up sales is a really powerful way to more directly own your platform for the long term, whereas one-off Kickstarters you immediately need to plan for off-platform websites, sales, communications, etc.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kickstarter is an excellent way to run a crowdfunding campaign. But if you already have a community built up, and have communication channels in place (via a newsletter, for example), and already run an online shop, then Kickstarter can be unnecessarily cumbersome. Kickstarter’s 10% fee is also quite hefty. By leaning on Shopify’s flexible Liquid templating system and reasonable CC processing fees, an independent publisher running a campaign can save some ~$7,000 for every $100,000 of sales by using Craigstarter instead of Kickstarter. That’s materially meaningful, especially in the world of books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is particularly relevant because I’m in the midst of learning more about how to run and setup Shopify stores, both for work, and ideally for some side projects. Gathering interest from a group of people so we can collectively fund / buy things is exactly the kind of thing I want to do.</p>

   Responding to @Tobie’s thread on examining open source as a commons. 

 In the context of digital abundance, the open source code itself can be infinitely copied. 

 1) open source code = public good 

 2) support, maintenance, etc. = common good 

 3) paying customers = common good (assuming multiple consultants or hosting services etc.)

  <p>Responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/tobie/status/1292720548846469120">@Tobie’s thread on examining open source as a commons</a>.</p>

<p>In the context of digital abundance, the open source code itself can be infinitely copied.</p>

<p>1) open source code = public good</p>

<p>2) support, maintenance, etc. = common good</p>

<p>3) paying customers = common good (assuming multiple consultants or hosting services etc.)</p>

<p>From my understanding of <a href="https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source">@Dries’ Makers and Takers post</a>, the distinction between a public good which can’t be depleted and a common good which can be, and must be protected, is key.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The activity around open source code is a common good. It is provided by the maintainers and other contributors. @tobie mentions maintenance, but also documentation, marketing, communication, responding to issues, and so on.</p>

<p>The “consumers” of these activities may evolve into new contributors, so in one model providing this activity will grow the commons. And even the add to the public good of the code if the new contributors eventually provide code, too.</p>

<p>But taking time for these activities is a scarce resource, as Tobie points out. Sponsorship and similar types of funding can potentially “buy” more of a maintainer’s time, so they can provide more support for (2) – but isn’t really a business model or a commons management strategy on its own.</p>

<p>Finally, my third point from above. Dries made this point quite clearly: if you have multiple businesses built around an open source code base, the (paying) customers are a common good: they can (mostly) only be the customer of one business.</p>

<p>Approaches that restrict aspects of a project to paying users run the risk of making this no longer a common or public good, and yet <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/governing-the-commons-the-evolution-of-institutions-for-collective-action-elisabeth-ostrom-1990/46">Ostrom</a> mostly proved that “good fences make good neighbours”. This is the challenge we face that @tobie highlights, and the ongoing experimental phase that I see open source at large moving into.</p>

<p>For a sustainable commons that goes beyond code, we need more makers than takers.</p>

  <p>Summary: Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and attributes others assign to us online.</p>


<a></a>


<p>
    Descartes didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">say</a> "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." We do not spring into existence because some administrative system provisions an identifer for us. No single administrative regime, or even a collection of them, defines us. <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> said this to me recently:
</p>
<blockquote>We are, within ourselves, what <a href="https://poets.org/poem/invictus">William Ernest Henley calls</a> “the captain” of “my unconquerable soul”, and what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7200015-i-know-i-am-deathless-i-know-this-orbit-of">Walt Whitman meant</a> when he said “I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,” and “I know that I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.” Each of us has an inner essence that is who we are.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Even in the digital realm, and limiting ourselves to what <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu calls</a> "functional identity", we are more than any single <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationship</a>. Our identity is something we are, not something we have. And it's certainly not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">someone else provides</a> to us. We are self-sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
    Some shrink from the self-sovereign label. There are some good reasons for their reluctance. Self-sovereignty requires some explanation. And it has political overtones that make some uncomfortable. But I've decided to embrace it. Self-sovereign identity is more than decentralized identity. Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. 
</p>

<p>
    If our identity is inalienable, then it's <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inalienable">not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied</a>. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one’s personal sphere—Whitman’s “orbit of mine.” Administrative identifiers, what others choose to call us, are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Most attributes are alienable1. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable.  The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereignty is concerned with relationships and boundaries. When we say a nation is sovereign, we mean that it can act as a peer to other sovereign states, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">not that it can do whatever it wants</a>. Sovereignty defines the source of our authority to act. Sovereignty defines a boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms. Self-sovereign identity defines the boundary in the digital space, gives tools to people and organizations so they can assert control—their autonomy, and defines the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">rules for how relationships are formed, authenticated, and used</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the opening chapter of her groundbreaking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, Shoshana Zuboff asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?" Not if it's based on administrative identity systems and the anemic, ofttimes dangerous, relationships they create. By starting with self-sovereignty, we found our digital relationships on principles that support and preserve human freedom, privacy, and dignity. So, while talking about trust, decentralization, credentials, wallets, and DIDs might help explain how self-sovereign identity works, sovereignty explains why we do it. If self-sovereignty requires explanation, maybe that's a feature, not a bug. 
</p>

 
 End Notes 
 
     I'm distinguishing attributes from traits without going too deep into that idea for now.

I loved technology - I learned to write in BASIC at the same time as English - but it was always at its best when it was in service of a story. I wrote small text adventure games and built simple animations.</p><p>Those were the programs that captured my imagination, too: <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/i-actually-was-hunting-ewoks-lucasfilm-games-the-early-years">LucasArts</a> adventure games like <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9bg7dv/the-secret-of-monkey-island-is-still-everything-i-want-in-video-games-049">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> and adventures like Infocom's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(video_game)">Douglas Adams himself had helped write</a>. They were stories, first and foremost, which happened to be enabled by technology.</p><p>I wanted to be a writer.</p><p>I still do.</p><p>The pandemic has led to many changes in my life. I spend most of my time in Santa Rosa, working remotely as the Head of Engineering for <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a> during the day and helping to care for my mother when I'm not behind my laptop. In some ways, I consider myself perversely lucky: her decline has coincided with a time that I'm able to work from anywhere. The hit to my personal life aside, it's worked out pretty well.</p><p>But I need something else - something that's mine, beyond the demands of my job and caring for my family. I've decided to give myself the gift of making space for my first love. I won't say exactly what I'm working on (I don't want to jinx it), but I've spent the summer taking classes and workshops on improving my plot and character skills. My aim is to have a first draft written by the end of November - and who knows what will happen after that.</p><p>It's been interesting to juxtapose the needs of plot and character with the product work I do every day. While the former is built from imagination, and the latter from research, they're oddly similar skills. Every product can be described in the framework of a three act structure; <a href="https://werd.io/2020/plot-and-startups">every target user has internal and external motivations</a> that form the basis of a compelling solution.</p><p>But that's not why I'm turning my attention to writing. I'm doing it because telling stories is something I find joy in. It's not to make a living or to improve my day job. It's not even because I think I'll be good at it (because, to be absolutely honest, I don't know).</p><p>It's none of those things. It's simply because I want to - and that's more than enough. It's something I can control, that allows me to be meditative and creative, that nobody can touch. And right now in particular, that couldn't be more valuable to me.</p>

<p>I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.  I’m pleased to report that I’ve released drafts that address all these issues.  The new drafts are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0-01.html">OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 – draft 01</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0-30.html">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 – draft 30</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-04.html">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 04</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-06.html">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 06</a> 
 
<p>The OpenID Connect working group waited to make these Final Specifications until we received feedback resulting from certification of logout deployments.  Indeed, this feedback identified a few ambiguities and deficiencies in the specifications, which have been addressed in the latest edits.  You can see the certified logout implementations at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>.  We encourage you to likewise certify your implementations now.</p>
<p>Please see the latest History entries in the specifications for descriptions of the normative changes made.  The history entries list the issue numbers addressed.  The issues can be viewed in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">OpenID Connect issue tracker</a>, including links to the commits containing the changes that resolved them.</p>
<p>All are encouraged to review these drafts in advance of the formal OpenID Foundation review period for them, which should commence in a few weeks.  If you believe that changes are needed before they become Final Specifications, please file issues describing the proposed changes.  Discussion on the <a href="mailto:openid-specs-ab@lists.openid.net">OpenID Connect mailing list</a> is also encouraged.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for writing the initial logout certification tests.  And thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_panva">Filip Skokan</a> for providing resolutions to two of the thornier Session Management issues.</p>

  <p>This week I've mostly been building <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a>, a plugin that adds GraphQL query support to Datasette.</p>

<p>I've been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=graphql">mulling this over</a> for a couple of years now. I wasn't at all sure if it would be a good idea, but it's hard to overstate how liberating Datasette's plugin system has proven to be: plugins provide a mechanism for exploring big new ideas without any risk of taking the core project in a direction that I later regret.</p>

<p>Now that I've built it, I think I like it.</p>

 A GraphQL refresher 

<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for APIs, first promoted by Facebook in 2015.</p>

<p>(Surprisingly it has nothing to do with the Facebook Graph API, which predates it by several years and is more similar to traditional REST. A third of respondents to my <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1289381085181140992">recent poll</a> were understandably confused by this.)</p>

<p>GraphQL is best illustrated by an example. The following query (a real example that works with <code>datasette-graphql</code>) does a whle bunch of work:</p>

  Retrieves the first 10 repos that match a search for "datasette", sorted by most stargazers first  Shows the total count of search results, along with how to retrieve the next page  For each repo, retrieves an explicit list oy columns  <code>owner</code> is a foreign key to the <code>users</code> table - this query retrieves the <code>name</code> and <code>html_url</code> for the user that owns each repo  A repo has issues (via an incoming foreign key relationship). The query retrieves the first three issues, a total count of all issues and for each of those three gets the <code>title</code> and <code>created_at</code>.  

<p>That's a lot of stuff! Here's the query:</p>

 <code>{
  repos(first:10, search: "datasette", sort_desc: stargazers_count) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
    }
    nodes {
      full_name
      description
      stargazers_count
      created_at
      owner {
        name

 datasette-graphql 

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin adds a <code>/graphql</code> page to any Datasette instance. It exposes a GraphQL field for every table and view. Those fields can be used to select, filter, search and paginate through rows in the corresponding table.</p>

<p>The plugin detects foreign key relationships - both incoming and outgoing - and turns those into further nested fields on the rows.</p>

<p>It does this by using table introspection (powered by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html#introspection">sqlite-utils</a>) to dynamically define a schema using the <a href="https://graphene-python.org/">Graphene</a> Python GraphQL library.</p>

<p>Most of the work happens in the <code>schema_for_datasette()</code> function in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/datasette_graphql/utils.py">datasette_graphql/utils.py</a>. The code is a little fiddly because Graphene usually expects you to define your GraphQL schema using classes (similar to Django's ORM), but in this case the schema needs to be generated dynamically based on introspecting the tables and columns.</p>

<p>It has a solid set of unit tests, including some <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/tree/main/examples">test examples</a> written in Markdown which double as further documentation (see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/950ca0740a658780cdd3a91e4bbfdda4f48645ea/tests/test_graphql.py#L62-L74">test_graphql_examples()</a>).</p>

 GraphiQL for interactively exploring APIs 

<p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> is the best thing about GraphQL. It's a JavaScript interface for trying out GraphQL queries which pulls in a copy of the API schema and uses it to implement really comprehensive autocomplete.</p>

<p><code>datasette-graphql</code> includes GraphiQL (inspired by <a href="https://www.starlette.io/graphql/">Starlette's implementation</a>). Here's an animated gif showing quite how useful it is for exploring an API:</p>

<p></p>

<p>A couple of tips: On macOS option+space brings up the full completion list for the current context, and command+enter executes the current query (equivalent to clicking the play button).</p>

 Performance notes 

<p>The most convenient thing about GraphQL from a client-side development point of view is also the most nerve-wracking from the server-side: a single GraphQL query can end up executing a LOT of SQL.</p>

<p>The example above executes at least 32 separate SQL queries:</p>

  1 select against repos (plus 1 count query)  10 against issues (plus 10 counts)  10 against users (for the <code>owner</code> field)  

<p>There are some optimization tricks I'm not using yet (in particular the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/execution/dataloader/">DataLoader pattern</a>) but it's still cause for concern.</p>

<p>Interestingly, SQLite may be the best possible database backend for GraphQL due to the characteristics explained in the essay <a href="https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html">Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite</a>.</p>

<p>Since SQLite is an in-process database, it doesn't have to deal with network overhead for each SQL query that it executes. A SQL query is essentially a C function call. So the flurry of queries that's characteristic for GraphQL really plays to SQLite's unique strengths.</p>

<p>Datasette has always featured arbitrary SQL execution as a core feature, which it protects using query time limits. I have an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/33">open issue</a> to further extend the concept of Datasette's time limits to the overall execution of a GraphQL query.</p>

 More demos 

<p>Enabling a GraphQL instance for a Datasette is as simple as <code>pip install datasette-graphql</code>, so I've deployed the new plugin in a few other places:</p>

 Future improvements 

<p>I have a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues">open issues</a> for the plugin describing what I want to do with it next. The most notable <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/16">planned improvement</a> is adding support for Datasette's canned queries.</p>

<p>Andy Ingram <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewingram/status/1289624490037530625">shared the following</a> interesting note on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GraphQL creators are (I think) unanimous in their skepticism of tools that bring GraphQL directly to your database or ORM, because they just provide carte blanche access to your entire data model, without actually giving API design proper consideration.</p></blockquote>

<p>My plugin does exactly that. Datasette is a tool for publishing raw data, so exposing everything is very much in line with the philosophy of the project. But it's still smart to put some design thought into your APIs.</p>

<p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">Canned queries</a> are pre-baked SQL queries, optionally with parameters that can be populated by the user.</p>

<p>These could map directly to GraphQL fields. Users could even use plugin configuration to turn off the automatic table fields and just expose their canned queries.</p>

<p>In this way, canned queries can allow users to explicitly design the fields they expose via GraphQL. I expect this to become an extremely productive way of prototyping new GraphQL APIs, even if the final API is built on a backend other than Datasette.</p>

 Also this week 

<p>A couple of years ago I wrote a piece about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Apr/25/register-members-interests/">Exploring the UK Register of Members Interests with SQL and Datasette</a>. I finally got around to automating this using GitHub Actions, so <a href="https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/">register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com</a> now updates with the latest data every 24 hours.</p>

<p>I renamed <code>datasette-publish-now</code> to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel">datasette-publish-vercel</a>, reflecting Vercel's name change from Zeit Now. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel/issues/26">how I did that</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert">datasette-insert</a>, which provides a JSON API for inserting data, defaulted to working unauthenticated. MongoDB and Elasticsearch have taught us that insecure-by-default inevitably leads to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/more-than-1000-databases-have-been-nuked-by-mystery-meow-attack/">insecure deployments</a>. I fixed that: the plugin now requires authentication, and if you don't want to set that up and know what you are doing you can install the deliberately named <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert-unsafe">datasette-insert-unsafe</a> plugin to allow unauthenticated access.</p>

 <p>Is this the way you want your brand to look?</p> 
<p>Digital advertising needs to sniff its own stench, instead of everybody’s digital butts.</p>
<p>A sample of that stench is wafting through the interwebs from&nbsp; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>, an ad industry bullphemism for yet another way to excuse the urge to keep tracking people against their wishes (and simple good manners) all over the digital world.</p>
<p>This new thing is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granfalloon">granfalloon</a> conjured by the <a href="https://www.ana.net/about">Association of National Advertisers</a>&nbsp;(aka the <a href="https://www.ana.net/">ANA</a>) and announced today in the faux-news style of the press release (which it no doubt also is) at the first link above. It begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AD INDUSTRY LAUNCHES “PARTNERSHIP FOR RESPONSIBLE ADDRESSABLE MEDIA” TO ENSURE FUTURE OF DIGITAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESSES &amp; CONSUMERS<br>
Governing Group of Industry Leaders Includes 4A’s, ANA, IAB, IAB Tech Lab, NAI, WFA, P&amp;G, Unilever, Ford, GM, IBM, NBCUniversal, IPG, Publicis, Adobe, LiveRamp, MediaMath, The Trade Desk</p>
<p>NEW YORK (August 4, 2020) — Leading trade associations and companies representing every sector of the global advertising industry today joined together to launch the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, an initiative to advance and protect critical functionalities like customization and analytics for digital media and advertising, while safeguarding privacy and improving the consumer experience. The governing group of the Partnership will include the most influential organizations in advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned about this from&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wendyndavis">@WendyDavis</a>, who wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/354347/ad-industry-launches-new-organization-will-push-g.html">this piece</a> in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/">MediaPost</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/">NiemanLab</a> summarizes what she reports with a <a href="https://twitter.com/NiemanLab/status/1290690368573526016">tweet</a> that reads, “A new ad-industry group will lobby Google and Apple to let them track users just a wee bit more, please and thank you.”</p>
<p>Writes Wendy,</p>
<blockquote><p>The group will soon reach out to browser developers and platforms, in hopes of convincing them to rethink recent decisions that will limit tracking, according to Venable attorney Stu Ingis, who will head the legal and policy working group.</p>
<p>“These companies are taking huge positions that impact the entire economy — the entire media ecosystem — with no real input from the media ecosystem,” Ingis says.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if the “entire media ecosystem” doesn’t contain the billions of humans being tracked.</p>
<p>Well, here’s a fact: ad blocking, which was already the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">biggest boycott in world history</a>&nbsp;five years ago, didn’t happen in a vacuum. Even though ad blockers had been available since 2004, use of them didn’t hockey-stick until 2012-13, exactly when adtech and its dependents in publishing gave the middle finger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was nothing more than a polite request, expressed by a browser, for some damn privacy while we go about our lives online. See <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/ad-blockers-and-the-next-chapter-of-the-internet">this</a> in Harvard Business Review:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s another fact: the browser makers actually care about their users, some of whom are paying customers (for example with Apple and Microsoft). They know what we want and need, and are giving it to us. Demand and supply at work.</p>
<p>The GDPR and the CCPA also didn’t happen in a vacuum. Both laws were made to protect citizens from exactly what adtech (tracking based advertising) does. And, naturally, the ad biz has been working mightily to obey the letter of those laws while violating their spirit. Why else would we be urged by cookie notices everywhere to “accept” exactly what we’ve made very clear that we don’t want?</p>
<p>So here are some helpful questions from the world’s billions to the brands now paying to have us followed like marked animals:</p>
<p>Have you noticed that not a single brand known to the world has been created by tracking people and aiming ads at them—even after spending a $trillion or two on doing that?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that nearly all the world’s major brands became known through advertising that not only didn’t track people, but <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advertising-30">sponsored</a> <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/09/01/journalism-2/">journalism</a> as well?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that tracking people and directing personalized messages at them—through “addressable media”—is in fact direct marketing, which we used to call junk mail?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Time to get the clues, ad biz. Brands too.</p>
<p>Start with&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, which says, if you only have time for one clue this year, this is the one to get…</p>
<p>we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers.<br>
we are human beings — and our reach exceeds your grasp.<br>
deal with it.</p>
<p>That year was 1999.</p>
<p>If advertising and marketing had bothered to listen back then, they might not be dealing today with the GDPR, the CCPA, and the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">earned dislike</a> of billions.</p>
<p>Next, please learn (or re-learn) the difference between real advertising and the junk message business. Find that lesson in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>See, adtech did not spring from the loins of Madison Avenue. Instead its direct ancestor is what’s called&nbsp;direct response marketing. Before that, it was called&nbsp;direct mail, or&nbsp;junk mail. In metrics, methods and manners, it is little different from its closest relative, spam.</p>
<p>Direct response marketing has always wanted to get personal, has always been data-driven, has never attracted the creative talent for which Madison Avenue has been rightly famous.&nbsp;<a>Look up&nbsp;best ads of all time</a>&nbsp;and you’ll find nothing but wheat. No direct response or adtech postings, mailings or ad placements on phones or websites.</p>
<p>Yes, brand advertising has always been data-driven too, but the data that mattered was how many people were exposed to an ad, not how many clicked on one — or whether you, personally, did anything.</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of brand advertising is annoying. But at least we know it pays for the TV programs we watch and the publications we read. Wheat-producing advertisers are called “sponsors” for a reason.</p>
<p>So how did direct response marketing get to be called advertising ? By looking the same. Online it’s hard to tell the difference between a wheat ad and a chaff one.</p>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what had happened to the ANA in 2018, when it <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/news/display-and-native-advertising/ana-association-of-national-advertisers-to-acquire-data-and-marketing-association/">acquired</a>&nbsp;what had been the Direct Marketing Association (aka DMA) and which by then called itself the&nbsp;Data &amp; Marketing Association.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>&nbsp;speaks in the voice of advertising’s alien replica. It does not “safeguard essential values in advertising as a positive economic force.” Instead it wants to keep using “addressable” advertising as the primary instrument of surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/theagency/what-if-we-don-t-need-advertising-at-all-cf8ae123f2d3#.r2dr769a8">Maybe it’s too late</a>&nbsp;to save advertising from its alien self. But perhaps not, if what’s left of advertising’s soul takes the writings of&nbsp;<a href="https://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">Bob Hoffman</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/adcontrarian">@AdContrarian</a>) to heart. That’s the only way I know for advertising to clean up its act.</p>

<p>Every so often, I'm asked to look over a startup pitch deck. I'm no longer investing, but if I have bandwidth and I think the elevator pitch is interesting, I'm happy to provide advice.<br><br>The team slide is, of course, the most important part of any pitch, because the people in your team are the most important part of any startup. Lately, I've seen the same problem again and again.<br><br>Here's a lesson I learned a long time ago, the hard way: in a startup, everyone has to bring something important to the table that meaningfully pushes the organization forward. The people who just want to tell people what to do, or who are there because having a startup is cool, add burn, slow you down, and reduce your chances for success.</p><p>That might sound like obvious advice, but over the years, I've encountered a lot of people who want to play-act working on a startup. They performatively hustle and talk the talk, looking and sounding the part, but when the rubber meets the road, they fall flat. They have the political and interpersonal skills, but they can't build.<br><br>Having an idea is not bringing to the table; neither is running a meeting; nor is strategy alone. You've got to make and build, bringing all of your skills and creativity together to actually create something from more or less nothing. Crafting a concrete experience is bringing something to the table. Building a process to repeatably sell is bringing something to the table. Writing and maintaining code is bringing something to the table. Telling other people what to do is not. And you've got to make sure those dynamics, that bias towards action and focus on execution, is a core part of your company culture and how you think about running the business.<br><br>It can get nasty. Sometimes, I've even seen non-builders actively try and subjugate the makers in an organization in order to cover for their own shortcomings. In larger companies, organizational politics are an inevitable if uncomfortable part of life, but these kinds of games can kill a startup very quickly. (65% of startups fail because of preventable human dynamics.) Founders need to watch for the politicians and the talkers, and optimize for the people who are not just willing and able to get their hands dirty, but willing and able to make that their entire job.<br><br>One of the most common mistakes I've seen in people who move from larger organizations to found startups is to build an organization out of people managers, and then outsource the making part. In effect, the blood and sweat and DNA of your service gets outsourced, while the only people in the office are talkers. It's absurd, and it belies a dismissive attitude towards building things that is orthogonal to success. At one startup I met, someone referred to the engineering team as "the back-room guys". Who would want to join that team?<br><br>If your team isn't able to make meaningful progress without outsourcing its work, it's the wrong team. That might not be true when you have a larger corporation's resources at your disposal - although I'm not convinced that it's not - but it's certainly true when you need to build something at speed.<br><br>Here's how it came out in the people slide of one deck I recently read. The entire founding team had MBAs and high-level management backgrounds, with no other applicable skills. (The best way to list those is describe what you've built in the past.) Inevitably, the team slide also proudly declared which schools they had graduated from. It couldn't be a bigger red flag: there was nothing to say they could actually build the startup they were proposing. Nobody had ever designed a user experience or written a line of code. To reiterate, it's not alone. This was far from the first startup I've seen - or the hundredth - that had the same problem.<br><br>The bottom line is: if you can't say definitively why you're the right team to build (not ideate, not strategize, not pitch, but build) this startup, then you need to stop kidding yourself and find something else to do. It's harsh advice, but in an environment where entrepreneurs are the new rock stars, a lot of people seem to want to cut corners and get famous (such as it is) without putting in the work. The truth is, there are no corners to be cut, and a startup made of people managers will inevitably fail. There is no alternative to building.</p>

Robinson’s editor’s note in Current Affairs of the same name</a>. “Quality” journalism is paywalled and the rest is free?</p>

<p>This point by Robinson on membership models seems key:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a podcaster who sells their product on Patreon rather than giving it away but filling it with mattress and “box-of-shit-a-month” ads has an important kind of freedom: they only have to please the audience, not the sponsors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Open Source”, funding, and digital works available at no cost have many parallels in industries beyond software, including journalism.</p>

<p>Kyle points out that not all creators should expect to be compensated just because they are creators:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I deserve…no compensation whatever for the bad musical improvizations, repetitive doodles, or unfunny or dead-end software libraries I churn out from time to time. Everyone, including me, should be fine with this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, that in areas of creative work, especially those available digitally, “giving away” work may be the best strategy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I happen to believe that in most areas of creative work, and in most adjacent industries, giving more away for $0 online would improve outcomes for most players, overall. Our business instincts and well-worn patterns haven’t quite kept up with the times, and never do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m thinking a lot about digital abundance lately in this same context.</p>

<p>Read the whole thing. You can also sign up on <a href="https://forum.artlessdevices.com/t/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-the-lies-are-free/54">Kyle’s Artless Devices forum</a> if you want to discuss this further.</p>

<p>This post is just a record of the key insights I took away from Sam Harris’ enlightening <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/211-the-nature-of-human-nature/">talk with Robert Plomin</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wish it were easier to capture and embed these kinds of audio segments, and to do so more effectively — ideally with transcription. It was way too much work to construct the URLs that deliver these segments into the embedded players I’ve included here, even with the <a href="http://jonudell.net/av/audio.html?url=https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/wakingup/Making_Sense_211_Plomin2028Paywall29.mp3&amp;startmin=58&amp;startsec=52&amp;endmin=62&amp;endsec=0">tool I made</a> for that purpose. It’s nice to have a standard embedded player, finally, but since it doesn’t show the endpoints of the segments you can’t tell they’re each just a few minutes. It looks like they all run to the end.</p>
<p>I wound up going to more trouble than it’s probably worth to convey the most memorable parts of that excellent podcast, and I don’t have time to transcribe more fully, but for what it’s worth, here are the segments that I’ll be remembering.</p>
<p>1. “The most important thing we’ve learned from the DNA revolution in the last 10 years is that genetic influences on complex traits are due to thousands of tiny DNA differences.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. “These polygenic scores are perfectly normally distributed.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. “I’m saying there are no disorders, there are just quantitative dimensions.”</p>

   “It’s not failure you should fear” 

 If you ever watched Cheers … the head writer was Rob Long. 

 If you listen to the podcast Martini Short - that’s Rob Long. 

 The opening story on the click through just cracked me up.

    When you talk with cheese aficionados, it doesn’t usually take long for the conversation to veer this way: away from curds, whey, and mold, and toward matters of life and death. With the zeal of nineteenth-century naturalists, they discuss great lineages and endangered species, painstakingly cataloguing those cheeses that are thriving and those that are lost to history.   — Ruby Tandoh

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>Summary:      We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. We need our digital relationships to have integrity and to be useful over a specified lifetime. Identity systems should provide relationship integrity and utility to participants for the appropriate length of time. Participants should be able to create relationships with whatever party will provide utility. SSI provides improved support for creating, managing, and using digital relationships.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    The most problematic word in the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> isn't "sovereign" but "identity" because whenever you start discussing identity, the conversation is rife with unspoken assumptions. Identity usually conjures thoughts of authentication and various federation schemes that purport to make authentication easier. I frequently point out that even though SSI has "identity" in it's name, there's no artifact in SSI called an "identity." Instead the user experience in an SSI system is based on forming relationships and using credentials.
</p>

<p>
    I've been thinking a lot lately about the role of relationships in digital identity systems and have come to the conclusion that we've been working on building building systems that support digital relationships without acknowledging the importance of relationships or using them in our designs and architectures.  The reason we build identity systems isn't to manage identities, it's to support digital relationships. 
</p>
<p>
    I recently read and then reread a 2011 paper called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163241">Identities Evolve: Why Federated Identity is Easier Said than Done</a> from <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/steve-wilson">Steve Wilson</a>. Despite being almost ten years old, the paper is still relevant, full of good analysis and interesting ideas. Among those is the idea that the the goal of using federation schemes to create a few identities that serve all purposes is deeply flawed. Steve's point is that we have so many identities because we have have lots of relationships. The identity data for a given relationship is contextual and highly evolved to fit its specific niche. 
</p>

<p>
    Steve's discussion reminded me of a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/samramji/darwins-finches-20th-century-business-and-apis/119">talk Sam Ramji used to give about speciation of APIs</a>. Sam illustrated his talk with a picture from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory/Adaptive-radiation">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to show adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches in response to evolutionary pressure. These 14 different finches all share a common ancestor, but ended up with quite different features because of specialization for a particular niche.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches (click to enlarge)

<p>
    In the same way, each of us have hundreds, even thousands, of online relationships. They each have a common root but are highly contextualized. Some are long-lived, some are ephemeral. Some are personal, some are commercial. Some are important, some are trivial. Still, we have them. The information about ourselves, what many refer to as identity data, that we share with each is just as adapted to the specific niche that the relationship represents as the Galapagos finches are to their niches. Once you realize this, the idea of creating a few online identities to serve all needs becomes preposterous. 
</p>

<p>
    Not only is each relationship evolved for a particular niche, but it is also constantly changing. Often those changes are just more of what's already there. For example, my Netflix account represents a relationship between me and Netflix. It's constantly being updated with my viewing data but not changing dramatically in structure. But some changes are larger. For example, it also allows me to create additional profiles which makes the relationship specialized for the specific members of my household. And when Netflix moved from DVDs only to streaming, the nature of my relationship with Netflix changed significantly.
</p>

<p>
    I'm convinced that identity systems would be better architected if we were more intentional about their need to support specialized relationships spanning millions of potential relationship types. This article is aimed at better understanding the nature of digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationships 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">fundamental problems of internet identity</a> is proximity. Because we're not interacting with people physically, our natural means of knowing who we're dealing with are useless. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu defines identity</a> as "how we recognize, remember, and respond" to another entity. These three activities correspond to three properties digital relationships must have to overcome the proximity problem: 
</p>
 
     Integrity—we want to know that, from interaction to interaction, we're dealing with the same entity we were before. In other words, we want to identify them. 
     Lifespan—normally we want relationships to be long-lived, although we also create ephemeral relationships for short-lived interactions.  
     Utility—we create online relationships in order to use them within a specific context. 
 

<p>
    We'll discuss each of these in detail below, followed by a discussion of risk in digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationship Integrity 

<p>
    Without integrity, we cannot recognize the other party to the relationship. Consequently, all identity systems manage relationship integrity as a foundational capability. Federated identity systems improve on one-off, often custom identity systems by providing integrity in a way that reduces user management overhead for the organization, increases convenience for the user, and increases security by eliminating the need to create one-off, proprietary solutions. SSI aims to establish integrity with the convenience of the federated model but without relying on an intervening IdP in order to provide autonomy and privacy. 
</p>

<p>
    A relationship has two parties, let's call them P1 and P2.1 P1 is connecting with P2 and, as a result, P1 and P2 will have a relationship. P1 and P2 could be people, organizations, or things represented by a website, app, or service. Recognizing the other party in an online relationship relies on being able to know that you're dealing with the same entity each time you encounter them. 
</p>

<p>
    In a typical administrative identity system, when P1 initiates a relationship with P2, P2 typically uses usernames and passwords to ensure the integrity of the relationship. By asking for a username to identify P1 and a password to ensure that it's the same P1 as before, P2 has some assurance that they are interacting with P1. In this model, P1 and P2 are not peers. Rather P2 controls the system and determines how and for what it is used. 
</p>

<p>
    In a federated flow, P1 is usually called the subject or consumer and P2 is called the relying party (RP). When the consumer visits the RP's site or opens their app, they are offered the opportunity to establish a relationship through an identity provider (IdP) whom the RP trusts. The consumer may or may not have a relationship with an IdP the RP trusts. RPs pick well-known IdPs with large numbers of users to reduce friction in signing up. The consumer chooses which IdP they want to use from the relying party's menu and is redirected to the IdP's identity service where they present a username and password to the IdP, are authenticated, and redirected back to the RP. As part of this flow, the RP gets some kind of token from the IdP that signifies that the IdP will vouch for this person. They may also get attributes that the IdP has stored for the consumer.2  
</p>

<p>
    In the federated model, the IdP is identifying the person and attesting the integrity of the relationship to the RP. The IdP is a third party, P3, who acts as an intervening administrative authority. Without their service, the RP may not have an alternative means of assuring themselves that the relationship has integrity over time. On the other hand, the person gets no assurance from the identity system about relationship integrity in this model. For that they must rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, which is visible in a web interaction, but largely hidden inside an app on a mobile device.  P1 and P2 are not peers in the federated model. Instead, P1 is subject to the administrative control of both the IdP and the RP. Further, the RP us subject to the administrative control of the IdP. 
</p>

<p>
    In SSI, a relationship is initiated when P1 and P2 exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DID). For example, when a person visits a web site or app, they are presented with a connection invitation. When they accept the invitation, they use a software agent to share a DID that they created. In turn, they receive a DID from the web site, app, or service.  We call this a "connection" since DIDs are cryptographically based and thus provide a means of both parties mutually authenticating. The user experience does not necessarily surface all this activity to the user. To get a feel for the user experience, run through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a>3.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast to the federated model, the participants in SSI mutually authenticate and the relationship has integrity without the intervention of a third party. By exchanging DIDs both parties have also exchanged public keys. They can consequently use cryptographic means to ensure they are interacting with the party who controls the DID they received when the relationship was initiated. Mutual authentication, based on self-initiated DIDs provides SSI relationships with inherent integrity. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">P1 and P2 are peers in SSI</a> since they both have equal control over the relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to removing the need for intermediaries to vouch for the integrity of the relationship, the peer nature of relationships in SSI also means that neither party has access to the authentication credentials of the other. Mutual authentication means that each party manages their own keys and never shares the private key with another party. Consequently, attacks, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">recent attack on Twitter accounts</a> can't happen in SSI because there's no administrator who has access to the credentials of everyone using the system. 
</p>

 Relationship Lifespan 

<p>
    Whether in the physical world or digital, relationships have lifespans. Some relationships are long-lived, some are short-term, and others are ephemeral, existing only for the duration of a single interaction. We typically don't think of it this way, but every interaction we have in the physical world, no matter for what purpose or how short, sets up a relationship. So too in the digital world, although our tools, especially as people online, have been sorely lacking. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe one of the biggest failings of modern digital identity systems is our failure to recognize that people often want, even need, short-lived relationships. Think about your day for a minute. How many people and organizations did you interact with in the physical world4 where you established a permanent relationship? What if whenever you stopped in the convenience store for a cup of coffee, you had to create a permanent relationship with the coffee machine, the cashier, the point of sale terminal, and the customers in line ahead and behind you? Sounds ridiculous. But that's what most digital interactions require. At every turn we're asked to establish permanent accounts to transact and interact online. 
</p>

<p>
    There are several reasons for this. The biggest one is that every Web site, app, or service wants to send you ads, at best, or track you on other sites, at worst. Unneeded, long-lived relationships are the foundation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance economy</a> that has come to define the modern online experience. 
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of services I want a long-lived relationship with. I value my relationships with Amazon and Netflix, for example. But there are many things I just need to remember for the length of the interaction. I ordered some bolts for a car top carrier from a specialty place a few weeks ago. I don't order bolts all the time, so I just want to place my order and be done. I want an ephemeral relationship. The Internet of Things will increase the need for ephemeral relationships. When I open a door with my digital credential, I don't want the hassle of creating a long-term relationship with it; I just want to open the door and then forget about it. 
</p>

<p>
    Digital relationships should be easy to set up and tear down. They should allow for the relationship to grow over time, if both parties desire. While they exist, they should be easily managable while providing all the tools for the needed utility. Unless there's long term benefit to me, I shouldn't need to create a long term relationship. And when a digital relationship ends, it should really be over. 
</p>



 Relationship Utility 

<p>
    Obviously, we don't create digital relationships just so we can authenticate the other party. Integrity is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for an identity system.  This is where most identity models fall short. We can understand why this is so given the evolution of the modern Web. For the most part, user-centric identity really took off when the web gave people reasons to visit places they didn't have a physical relationship with, like an ecommerce web site. Once the identity system had established the integrity of the relationship, at least from the web site's perspective, we expected HTTP would provide the rest.
</p>

<p>
    Most Identity and Access Management systems don't provide much beyond integrity except possibly access control. Once Facebook has established who you are, it knows just what resources to let you see or change.  But as more and more of our lives are intermediated by digital services, we need more utility from the identity system than simple access control. The most that an IdP can provide in the federated model is integrity and, perhaps, a handful of  almost-always-self-asserted attributes in a static, uncustomizable schema. But rich relationships require much more than that.
</p>

<p>
    Relationships are established to provide utility. An ecommerce site wants to sell you things. A social media site wants to show you ads. Thus, their identity systems, built around the IAM system, are designed to do far more than just establish the integrity of the relationship. They want to store data about you and your activities. For the most part this is welcome. I love that Amazon shows me my past orders, Netflix remembers where I was in a series, and Twitter keeps track of my followers and past tweets. 
</p>

<p>
    The true identity system is much, much larger and specialized than the IAM portion. All of the account or profile data these companies use is properly thought of as part of the identity system that they build and run. Returning to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern [the] information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regardless of whether or not they outsource the integrity of their relationships (and notice that none of the companies I list above do), companies still have to keep track of the relationships they have with customers or users in order to provide the service they promise. They can't outsource this to a third party because the data in their identity system has evolved to suit the needs of the specific relationship. We'll never have a single identity that serves all relationships because they are unique contexts that demand their own identity data. Rip out the identity system from a Netflix or Amazon and it won't be the same company anymore.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to a simple, but important conclusion: You can't outsource a relationship. Online apps and services decorate the relationship with information they observe, and use that information to provide utility to the relationships they administer. Doing this, and doing it well is the foundation of the modern web. 
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, the bad news is that SSI is not going to reduce the need for companies to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">build, manage, and use identity systems</a>. Their identity systems are what make them what they are—there is no "one size fits all" model. The good news is that SSI makes online relationships richer. Relationships are easier and less expensive to manage, not just for companies, but for people too. Here's some of the ways SSI will enhance the utility of digital relationships:
</p>

 
     Richer, more trustworthy data—Relationships change over time because the parties change. We want to reliably ascertain facts about the other party in a relationship, not just from direct observation, but also from third parties in a trustworthy manner to build confidence in the actions of the other party within a specific context. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a>, self-issued or from others, allow relationships to be enhanced incrementally as the relationships matures or changes. 
     
     Autonomy and choice through peer relationships—Peer relationship give each party more autonomy than traditional administrative identity systems have provided. And, through standardization and substitutability, SSI gives participants choice in what vendors and agents they employ to manage their relationships. The current state of digital identity is asymmetric, providing companies with tools that are difficult or unwieldy for people to use. People like <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and organizations like <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2019/05/13/me2b-2/">Project VRM</a> and the <a href="https://www.me2b.us">Me2B Alliance</a> argue that people need tools for managing online relationships too. SSI provides people with tools and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy</a> to manage their online relationships with companies and each other. 
     
     Better, more secure communications—DID exchange provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">private, secure messaging channel</a> using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm protocol</a>. This messaging channel is mutually recognized, authenticated, and encrypted. 
     Unifying, interoperable protocol for data transmission—DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, and DIDComm provides a standardized, secure means of interaction. Just like URLs, HTML, and HTTP provided for an interoperable web that led to an explosion of uses, the common protocol of SSI will ensure everyone benefits from the network effects. 
     
     Consistent user experience—Similarly, SSI provides a consistent user experience, regardless of what digital wallet people use. SSI's user experience is centered on relationships and credentials, not arcane addresses and keys. The user experience mirrors the experience people have of managing credentials in the physical world. 
     
     Support for ad hoc digital interactions—The real world is messy and unpredictable. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">SSI is flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios</a> that the world presents us and supports sharing multiple credentials from various authorities in the ways the scenario demands.
     
 

<p>
    These benefits are delivered using an architecture that provides a common, interoperable layer, called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a>, upon with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">anyone can build the identity systems they need</a>. A ubiquitous identity layer for the internet must be a metasystem that provides the building blocks and protocols necessary for others to build identity systems that meet the needs of any specific context or domain. An identity metasystem is a prerequisite for an online world where identity is as natural as it is in the physical world. An identity metasystem can remove friction, decrease cognitive overload, and make online interactions more private and secure.
</p>

 Relationships, Risk, and Trust 

<p>
    Trust is a popular term in the SSI community. People like Steve Wilson and <a href="https://identitywoman.net/about-kaliya/bio/">Kaliya Young</a> rightly ask about risk whenever someone in the identity community talks about trust. Because of the proximity problem, digital relationships are potentially risky. One of the goals of an identity system is to provide evidence that can be used in the risk calculation. 
</p>

<p>
    In their excellent paper, <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/NICTAR-2">Risk and Trust</a>, Nickel and Vaesen define trust as the "disposition to willingly rely on another person or entity to perform actions that benefit or protect oneself or one’s interests in a given domain." From this definition, we see why crypto-proponents often say "To trust is good, but to not trust is better." The point being that not having to rely on some other human, or human-mediated process is more likely to result in a beneficial outcome because it reduces the risk of non-performance. 
</p>

<p>
    Relationships imply a shared domain, context, and set of activities. We often rely on third parties to tell us things relevant to the relationship. Our vulnerability, and therefore our risk, depends on the degree of reliance we have on another party's performance.  Relationships can never be "no trust" because of the very reasons we create relationships. Bitcoin, and similar systems, can be low or no trust precisely because the point of the system is to reduce the reliance on any relationship at all. The good news, is the architecture of the SSI stack significantly limits the ways we must rely on external parties for the exchange of information via verifiable credentials and thus reduces the vulnerability of parties inside and outside of the relationship. The SSI identity metasystem clearly delineates the parts of the system that are low trust and those where human processes are still necessary. 
</p>

<p>
    The exchange of verifiable credentials can be split into two distinct parts as shown in the following diagram. SSI reduces risk in remote relationships using the properties of these two layers to combine cryptographic processes with human processes. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	SSI Stack (click to enlarge)



<p>
    The bottom layer, labeled Identity Metasystem, comprises two components: a set of verifiable data repositories for storing metadata about credentials and a processing layer supported by protocols and practices for the transport and validation of credentials. Timothy Ruff <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">uses the analogy of shipping containers</a> to describe the identity metasystem. Verifiable credentials are analogous to shipping containers and the metasystem is analogous to the shipping infrastructure that makes intermodal shipping so efficient and secure. The Identity Metasystem provides a standardized infrastructure that similarly increases the efficiency and security of data interchange via credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    The top layer, labeled Identity Systems, is where people and organizations determine what credentials to issue, determine what credentials to seek and hold, and determine which credentials to accept. This layer comprises the individual credential exchange ecosystems that spring up and the governance processes for managing those credential ecosystems. In Timothy's analogy to shipping containers, this layer is about the data—the cargo—that the credential is carrying.
</p>

<p>
    The Identity Metasystem allows verifiable credentials can be cryptographically checked to ensure four key properties that relate to the risk profile. 
</p>
 
     Who issued the credential? 
     Was the credential issued to the party presenting it? 
     Has the credential been tampered with? 
     Has the credential been revoked? 
 
<p>
    These checks show the fidelity of the credential and are done without the verifier needing a relationship with the issuer. And because they're automatically performed by the Identity Metasystem, they significantly reduce the risk related to using data transferred using verifiable credentials. This is the portion of credential exchange that could be properly labeled "low or no trust" since the metasystem is built on standards that ensure the cryptographic verifiability of fidelity without reliance on humans and human-mediated processes. 
</p>

<p>
    The upper, Identity Systems, layer is different. Here we are very much relying on the credential issuer. Some of the questions we might ask include:
</p>
 
     Is the credential issuer, as shown by the identifier in the credential, the organization we think they are? 
     Is the organization properly accredited in whatever domain they're operating in?  
     What data did the issuer include in the credential? 
     What is the source of that data? 
     How has that data been processed and protected?  
 

<p>
    These questions are not automatically verifiable in the way we can verify the fidelity of a credential. They are different for each domain and perhaps different for each type of relationship based on the vulnerability of the parties to the data in the credential and their appetite for risk. Their answers depend on the provenance of the data in the credential. We would expect to see credential verifier's perform provenance checks by answering these and other questions during the process they use to establish trust in the issuer. Once the verifier has established this trust, the effort needed to evaluate the provenance of the data in a credential should cease or be greatly reduced.  
</p>

<p>
    As parties in a relationship share data with each other, the credential verifier will spend effort evaluating the provenance of issuers of credentials they have not previously evaluated. Once that is done, the metasystem will provide fidelity checks on each transaction. For the most part, SSI does not impose new ways of making these risk evaluations. Rather, most domains already have processes for establishing the provenance of data. For example, we know how to determine if a bank is a bank, the accreditation status of a university, and the legitimacy of a business. Companies with heavy reliance on properties of their supply chain, like pharmaceuticals, already have processes for establishing the provenance of the supply chain. For the most part, verifiable credential exchange will faithfully present digital representations of the kinds of physical world processes, credentials, and data we already know how to evaluate.  Consequently, SSI promises to significantly reduce the cost of reducing risk in remote relationships without requiring wholesale changes to existing business practices. 
</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>
    Relationships have always been the reason we created digital identity systems. Our historic focus on relationship integrity and IAM made modern Web 2.0 platforms and services possible, but has limited use cases, reduced interoperability, and left people open to privacy and security breaches. By focusing on peer relationships supported by an Identity Metasystem, SSI not only improves relationships integrity but also better supports flexible relationship lifecycles, more functional, trustworthy relationship utility, and provides tools for participants to correctly gauge, respond to, and reduce risks inherent in remote relationships. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     For simplicity, I'm going to limit this discussion to two-party relationships, not groups. 
     I've described federation initialization very generally here and left out a number of details that distinguish various federation architectures.  
     Connect.me is just one of a handful of digital wallets that support the same SSI user experience. Others vendors include <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a>, and <a href="https://self-ssi.com/en/">eSatus AG</a>.

So I did, with this: Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;WVPS&nbsp;of&nbsp;Vermont Public Radio.

 <p>Radio is moving from these to servers of streams and podcasts.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Public-Radio-What-is-the-best-NPR-station-in-the-country">Public Radio: What is the best NPR station in the country</a>? That’s a question on Quora I thought needed answering. So I did, with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WVPS">WVPS</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="www.vpr.org" href="https://www.vpr.org/#stream%2F0">Vermont Public Radio</a>. Because, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb_menu_rank">Nielsen’s Audio Ratings</a>, it scores a 12.6 in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb505">its home market of Burlington</a>, and a 16.2 in its neighbor market of<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb432">&nbsp;Montpelier-Waterbury</a>. Far as I know, those are tops among all the country’s NPR-affiliated stations.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions go to WUOM&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb581">in Ann Arbor</a>&nbsp;with a 13.0, KCLU&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb591">in Santa Barbara</a>&nbsp;with a 10.2—plus others you’ll find if you follow the links in&nbsp;<a title="blogs.harvard.edu" href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>, which I published in April of last year. All the numbers I sourced have changed since then, but they’re easy to find at the links I provided.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, “best” will come to mean&nbsp;which stations, producers and distributors are best at streaming and podcasting. Because that’s where listening is headed. Vermont Public Radio makes that clear on their own website, which appends “#stream/0” to its URL when you go there—and does its best, on the site, to encourage listening over-the-net rather than just over-the-air.</p>
<p>At this point in history, nearly all radio stations already stream, for a good reason: in the digital world, where every one of us with a smartphone and a data plan has the best radio ever made, antique broadcast virtues such as “range” and “coverage” have become bugs. This is why, when my family drove around Spain in a rental car last summer, we listened to KCLU from our home town of Santa Barbara, piped from one of our phones through the car’s entertainment system (which is no longer called a “radio”). It’s also why, when I’m up early on the West Coast, I often listen to WBUR from Boston or WNYC from New York, my other home towns. (I get around—or at least I did before the plague.)</p>
<p>The streaming numbers in Nielsen’s ratings are still low, but they are growing, and in many markets exceed the numbers for nearly all the remaining AM stations. For example, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">the latest ratings for Washington, DC,</a>&nbsp;36 stations are listed: 33 FM, 2 streams and 2 AM. Those are drawn from a roster of 52 FM and 35 AM stations with listenable signals in Washington (according to&nbsp;<a title="radio-locator.com" href="http://radio-locator.com/">radio-locator.com</a>)—and 6 of those FM signals are translators for AM stations, including the two AMs that show in the ratings (which means that even the ratings for AM stations were likely for those stations’ FM signals).</p>
<p>Also, while&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;stations,&nbsp;podcasting&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;programming, aka “content.” Podcasting is exploding now, and earning ever-larger slices of the listening pie, which is a finite sum of people’s time. Podcasting wins at this because it has far more optionality than live over-the-air radio. You can listen when you like, slide forward and backward through a show, jump past ads or skip over topics you’d rather miss, and listen at 1.5x or 2x the normal speed. Those are huge advantages.</p>
<p>It’s also not for nothing that SiriusXM just paid $325 for Stitcher (<a title="variety.com" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-325-million-1234704617/#!">says Variety)</a>, and not long before that Spotify&nbsp;<a title="www.msn.com" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/joe-rogan-signs-exclusive-100-million-podcast-deal-with-spotify/ar-BB14jDHC">paid $100 million</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan">Joe Rogan</a>’s podcast and (<a title="www.businessinsider.com" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ringer-deal-price-250-million-podcasting-bill-simmons-report-2020-2">according to Business Inside</a>r) nearly $200 million for&nbsp;<a title="www.theringer.com" href="https://www.theringer.com/">The Ringer</a>&nbsp;and “nearly $400 million in recent purchases of Gimlet Media, Anchor, and Parcast.”</p>
<p>For that kind of money you could buy every AM and FM station in New York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Noncommercial players are also looking pretty good in the podcasting world as well.&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">According to Podtrac</a>, NPR is the #1 podcast publisher and PRX is #5. Also showing well are WNYC Studios, This American Life/Serial and American Public Media. NPR also has 9 of&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">the top 20 podcasts</a>. In fact the majority (11) of those top 20 are from public radio sources.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the public stations with head starts in podcast production are WBEZ in Chicago, WBUR in Boston, WNYC in New York, KQED in San Francisco, KPCC and KCRW in Los Angeles and others you’ll hear credited when they open or close a show.</p>
<p>But it’s early. Expect lots of change in the coming months and years as many podcast creators, producers and distributors jockey for positions in two races. One is the free public one, syndicated by&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>&nbsp;on the open Internet and ready to hear on any browser, app or device. The other is the private subscription one, available only through the owner’s services. This is clearly where SiriusXM and Spotify are both going. SiriusXM is audible only by subscription, while Spotify remains $free (for now) but exclusive. (For example, Michelle Obama’s&nbsp;<a title="open.spotify.com" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/71mvGXupfKcmO6jlmOJQTP">new podcast</a>&nbsp;is available only on Spotify.) This split, between free/open and paid/closed, will be a big story over the coming years.</p>
<p>So, in the meantime, hats off to Vermont Public Radio for being the top public radio operation in the country—at least in its markets’ ratings. And stay tuned for the fights among players in streaming and podcasting.</p></blockquote>
<p>I expect VPR will continue being the alpha broadcasting, streaming and podcasting service in its home state, both because it does a great job and because Vermont is very much a collection of communities that have come to depend on it.</p>
<p>And, if you want to know why I think journalism of the fully non-fake kind has a last (or first) refuge in the most local forms, dig <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">The story isn’t the whole story</a>, my TEDx talk about that.</p>

<p>The topic of adding JWT support to Django core comes up occasionally - here's James Bennett's detailed argument for not doing that. The short version is that the JWT specification isn't just difficult to implement securely: it's fundamentally flawed, which results in things like five implementations in three different languages all manifesting the same vulnerability. Third party modules exist that add JWT support to Django, but baking it into core would act as a form of endorsement and Django's philosophy has always been to encourage people towards best practices.</p>

<p>This should have been a tweet. But the format was not&nbsp;fitting.</p><p>The promise of a personal decentralized identity is that the trust component involved in your use of credentials in the real world can be replicated online. In the real world, when you present your driving license to a law enforcement officer during a periodical check, the officer checks its validity and legitimacy by looking at specific features on your driving license. Since they are a trained eye, the error rate in verifying your document is lower than what a layman would have and the accuracy even better when the officer is aided by tools such as UV light to check for holograms and other security features. Once they are satisfied with your document, you can proceed with your business or transaction at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It may seem straightforward that the scenario described is replicable digitally. If the interaction between you and an academic officer or a law enforcement officer was digital, you would send a scanned copy of your driving license or school leaving certificate over email or through an online portal. Once submitted, they verify security features on the documents and either involve a senior officer or send them to a verifying body to ascertain authenticity. This takes time and before you get a confirmation that your document was approved, and that you can proceed with your intended activity, days are gone not to mention the opportunity cost involved.</p><p>While that has been largely the case in our regular interactions involving using our identifying documents and issued credentials, the bottlenecks can be minimized to make processes smoother. We should note that the document, the primary actor in the entire interaction/exchange is not truly digital. It is a scan, an image or a photograph of your certificate or license. You and I (the humans) can read and make out the information contained there. Computers cannot. We are in 2020. Computers should. If your documents were machine readable, computer systems that handle them would be able to process the information, and heck, even verify the information by themselves. Some documents today are machine readable and make information systems very efficient. But there should be a way to make this the new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Credentials (VCs). An open standard that forward thinking technologists and organizations, after facing the frustrations described and seeing the potential value being locked up in non-machine-verifiable documents, came up with under the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>). Verifiable Credentials support machine-to-machine communication and their proofs (security features) can be verified cryptographically using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Issuing and Verifying authorities have their work made easier as they can independently check a common registry for proofs regarding the individual and the credential presented. There is no need for a third party to countercheck where the Mathematical proofs are well implemented and the registry, once written on is tamper proof. Such a database could be a blockchain or a sufficiently consensus driven distributed ledger.</p>Figure 1: Exchange of Verifiable Credentials between Issuer, Holder, and Verifier.<p>Why should you care? Well, in this COVID-19 era, we are all trying to avoid unnecessary human contact. Because of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, even documents are being quarantined if physical copies are exchanged and more services now insist on digital forms of documents. That’s where Verifiable Credentials come in. It should be possible, once available, that a certificate proving you have been vaccinated against corona virus or that you graduated from university remotely, is shared as a Verifiable Credential. One noteworthy forward thinking initiative that is working on making this a reality is the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). Vibranium ID is a part of it. The work of the initiative is not restricted to the pandemic as a reactive response but is a basis as to how we can unlock the promise of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Fun fact: After the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7V2mXWUO5fjiwJODyq_wMvkL9EDSf3m7emLxLpvzTk/edit#">Governance Framework (GF) of the CCI</a> approved the CCI GF, three Kenyan software developers (Mbora Maina, Amos Kibet, Chris Achinga) and I translated the document into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejnylgHi-A_nZeZrnwBjaWzhjPIDq8ETMMJiiwKZbm0/edit?usp=sharing">Kiswahili</a>. The translation gives context as to the practicability of VCs in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Innovation waits for no man. The pandemic has proved so. The adjustment brought by this disease has surely made some processes redundant and will bring gamechanging technologies to the foreground. As Peter Drucker famously said, “Innovate or&nbsp;die”.</p><p>References</p><p>Figure 1: A Verifiable Credentials Primer, by Manu Sporny, Digital&nbsp;Bazaar</p><p>W3C Verifiable Credentials - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/digital-credentials-for-a-safer-world-37a2e1694791">Digital Credentials for a Safer World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>This week I've been mainly experimenting with binary data storage in SQLite. sqlite-utils can now insert data from binary files, and datasette-media can serve content over HTTP that originated as binary BLOBs in a database file.</p>

<p>Paul Ford piqued my interest in this when he tweeted about loading thousands of PDF documents into a SQLite database:</p>

<blockquote><p>I made a shell script that loads thousands of PDF docs into SQLite databases. That means I can have a web server that produces infinite randomly chosen US Military PowerPoint slides that I can scroll on my phone when I'm around the house. <a href="https://t.co/n3zUlbCuBB">pic.twitter.com/n3zUlbCuBB</a></p>— Paul Ford (@ftrain) <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1287183861785473027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>The SQLite documentation claims that serving smaller binary files from BLOB columns can be <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">35% faster than the filesystem</a>. I've done a little bit of work with binary files in SQLite - the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-binary">datasette-render-binary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-images">datasette-render-images</a> both help display BLOB data - but I'd never really dug into it in much detail.</p>

 sqlite-utils insert-files 

<p>The first step was to make it easier to build database files that include binary data.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> is my combination Python library and CLI tool for building SQLite databases. I've been steadily evolving it for a couple of years now, and it's the engine behind my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> collection of tools for personal analytics.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-binary-data-from-files">insert-files command</a> can be used to insert content from binary files into a SQLite database, along with file metadata.</p>

<p>The most basic usage looks like this:</p>

 <code>sqlite-utils insert-files gifs.db images *.gif</code> 

<p>By default, this creates a database table like so:</p>

 <code>CREATE TABLE [images] (
    [path] TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    [content] BLOB,
    [size] INTEGER
);</code> 

<p>You can customize this table to include other file metadata using the <code>-c</code> (short for <code>--column</code>) option:</p>

 <code>sqlite-utils insert-files gifs.db images *.gif \
    -c path -c md5 -c last_modified:mtime -c size --pk=path</code> 

<p>This creates a table with the following schema:</p>

 <code>CREATE TABLE [images] (
    [path] TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    [md5] TEXT,
    [last_modified] FLOAT,
    [size] INTEGER
);</code> 

<p>If you pass a directory instead of a file name the command will recursively add every file in that directory.</p>

<p>I also improved <code>sqlite-utils</code> with respect to outputting binary data. The new <code>--raw</code> option dumps the binary contents of a column directly to standard out, so you can read an image back out of one of the above tables like so:</p>

 <code>sqlite-utils photos.db \
    "select content from images where path=:path" \
    -p path 'myphoto.jpg' \
    --raw &gt; myphoto.jpg</code> 

<p>This example also demonstrates the new support for <code>:parameters</code> passed using the new <code>-p</code> option, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/124">#124</a>.</p>

<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> usually communicate in JSON, but JSON doesn't have the ability to represent binary values. Datasette outputs binary values <a href="https://datasette-render-images-demo.datasette.io/favicons/favicons.json?_shape=array&amp;_size=1">like so</a>:</p>

 <code>"data": {
  "$base64": true,
  "encoded": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAY..."
}</code> 

<p>I added support for the same format to <code>sqlite-utils</code> - so you can now query binary columns and get out that nested object, or pipe JSON with that nested structure in to <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> and have it stored as a binary BLOB in the database.</p>

 datasette-media 

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media">datasette-media</a> is a plugin for serving binary content directly from Datasette on a special URL. I originally built it while working on <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-photos">Dogsheep Photos</a> - given a SQLite file full of Apple Photos metadata I wanted to be able to serve thumbnails of the actual images via my Datasette web server.</p>

<p>Those photos were still stored on disk - the plugin lets you configure a SQL query like this which will cause hits to <code>/-/media/photos/$UUID</code> to serve that file from disk:</p>

 <code>{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-media": {
            "photo": {
                "sql": "select filepath from apple_photos where uuid=:key"
            }
        }
    }
}</code> 

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media/issues/14">Issue #14</a> added support for <code>BLOB</code> columns as well. You can now configure the plugin like this to serve binary content that was stored in the database:</p>

 <code>{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-media": {
            "thumb": {
                "sql": "select content from thumbnails where uuid=:key"
            }
        }
    }
}</code> 

<p>This would serve content from a BLOB column in a <code>thumbnails</code> table from the URL <code>/-/media/thumb/$UUID</code>.</p>

<p>I really like this pattern of configuring plugins using SQL queries, where the returned column names have special meaning that is interpreted by the plugin. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a> use a similar trick.</p>

<p>I expanded <code>datasette-media</code> with a few other related features:</p>

  Return a <code>content_url</code> column and it will proxy content from that URL  Set <code>"enable_transform": true</code> for a media bucket to enable <code>?w=</code> and <code>?h=</code> and <code>?format=</code> parameters for transforming the image before it is served to the user  Return a <code>content_filename</code> column to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media#setting-a-download-file-name">set a download file name</a> (in a <code>content-disposition</code> HTTP header) prompting the user's browser to download the file  

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media#readme">README</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media/releases">release notes</a> for more details.</p>

 Also this week 

<p>I renamed <code>datasette-insert-api</code> to just <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert">datasette-insert</a>, reflecting my plans to add non-API features to that plugin in the future.</p>

<p>In doing so I had to figure out how to rename a PyPI package such that dependent projects would continue to work. I ended up building a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pypi-rename">pypi-rename cookiecutter template</a> encoding what I learned.</p>

<p>I enabled PostgreSQL full-text search for my blog's Django Admin interface, and wrote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/django/postgresql-full-text-search-admin.md">a TIL on how I did it</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite/issues/26">added compound primary key support</a> to <code>db-to-sqlite</code>, so now it can convert PostgreSQL or MySQL databases to SQLite if they use compound primary keys.</p>

 TIL this week

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable.

Among other things I also learned what the "correlation" database statistic does: it's a measure of how close-to-sorted the values in a specific column are, which helps PostgreSQL decide if it should do an index scan or a bitmap scan when making use of an index.</p>

<p>At the Real Estate Cafe, we’re always cooking up something creative — often revisiting anniversaries and ideas that were “half baked” and still need collaborators and guest chefs to cocreate a masterpiece. One of our best events was 24 years ago (July 29, 1996) when Ralph Nader participated in a roundtable discussion on “Recreating the Real Estate Industry” online. To celebrate a season of anniversaries, we’re going to revisit innovations and long-overdue reforms using MyVote.io, an interactive platform we first used to propose a series of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.myvote.io/event/16186140">RE2020 Unconferences</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the remaining 20 weeks in 2020, we invite collaborators to engage 20 different content areas and ask YOU to vote on potential session topics. The goal this time is NOT to host an event in a single weekend but to use the Covid crisis to revisit our original question:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What will the real estate ecosystem look like in the future?” not in the year 2020, as was our goal in 2015, but 20 years from now to serve the kind of society we want to cocreate post pandemic?&nbsp;</p>



<p>READY TO VOTE?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which of these topics would you like fellow real estate consumer advocates and other stakeholders to revisit in coming weeks, and how would you like to be involved? See range of options from listening to a podcast to joining a working group for each “entree “on our Menu of Innovations &amp; Reforms!</p>



<p>To mark the anniversary with Ralph Nader and mirror the Congressional hearing on Big Tech today, we’ll start our call to reform real estate with 10 topics related to Consumer Protection.</p>







<p>+&nbsp; +&nbsp; +</p>



<p>This link will take you to the interactive voting platform where you can cast your vote.&nbsp; Feel free to share this link via social media:</p>

<p>来る日本時間7月28日午前3:30から、「So You Want to Base on Consent?」というタイトルでIdentiverseで講演します。</p>



<p>このタイトルは、グレン・グールドの「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲から着想を得たもので、ある意味無謀なことを、といいながら、じゃぁどうしたらよいのかということをISO/IEC 29184 から抽出してお話します。</p>



<p>この「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲の出だしの歌詞、こうなんです。</p>



<blockquote><p>So you want to write a fugue?<br>You’ve got the Urge to write a fugue, <br>You’ve got the nerve to write a fugue, <br>So go ahead. </p>Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue (1963)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、フーガが書きたいとな？<br>フーガを書きたいという衝動があり、<br>フーガを書くという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p>上記：私訳</blockquote>



<p>出だしでそう歌って、フーガの様々な技法をこの曲の中で紹介していきます。</p>



 

 Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue? (1963)



<p>「フーガを書きたいを」、「同意で取り扱いたい」で置き換えたのがこの講演です。いわば、</p>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、同意でやりたいとな？<br>同意でやりたいという衝動があり、<br>同意でやりきるという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p></blockquote>



<p>内容は…7月21日にPWSでやったのとほぼ同じことの英語版です。もしご興味があればどうぞ。</p>



<p>Monday, July 27, 12:30 – 12:55 (Mountain Time)</p>



<p>So You Want to Base on Consent?</p>



<p>Many people seem to believe that having their customers pressing “Agree” button is good enough to collect their “consent”. That’s actually not the case. Obtaining privacy consent has very high bar partly because that is the exception mechanism that you can resort to only when other lawful bases for the processing of personal data does not work.</p>



<p>This session will briefly touch on other lawful bases and what is needed for potentially valid consent, then goes on to explain the requirements for privacy notice and consent process set out in “ISO/IEC 29184 Online privacy notices and consent”.</p>



<p>ISO/IEC 29184 is an international standard that has been in making for the last 5 years. Stakeholders involved in the discussion included data protection authorities around the globe, technical community, lawyers, and businesses. It sets out the requirements for 1) What are needed to be in a privacy notice, 2) What are needed to be done in obtaining the consent, 3) What are needed to be done in the maintenance of privacy notices. For any business that wants to respect customer privacy, this document provides excellent guidance on what needs to be followed.<br>Speaker/s: Nat Sakimura<br>Topic: Privacy</p>



<p>Sub Topic: Standards, Architecture &amp; Deployment, Consumer Identity, User Experience, Vision &amp; Strategy</p>

<p>A long time ago, I promised to share the blogs I subscribe to. This is that post - in service of an important question. Who else should I be subscribing to? In particular, which underheard voices should I be listening to, on any subject? Do you have a blog? Have I overlooked you? Let me know.</p><p>As with my end-of-month roundups, I've made an attempt to sort these sources into categories, but I subscribe to people, not topics.

The book is dedicated to Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana (in the photo), our mentor for more than a decade and for many more years to&nbsp;come! Behind the&nbsp;Scenes <p>The book Microservices Security in Action, which I authored with <a href="https://medium.com/u/8a9c1004cd42">Nuwan Dias</a> is now available to buy online from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617295957">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-security-in-action">Manning</a>. Nuwan and I spent last 27+ months writing/re-writing the book. It was a marathon effort, but yet a great experience, and we both are very glad to see how it came out at the end! This is the story, which lead us to write the&nbsp;book.</p><p>While working at WSO2 for more than a decade, we’ve seen how the integration domain evolved over time from SOAP-based services to JSON/RESTful services and then to microservices. We spent most of our early days at WSO2 contributing to the Apache Axis2 project, which was a popular SOAP engine in those days, and to the Apache Rampart project, which implements many Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) standards for web services security.</p><p>Even though SOAP was quite promising in those days, it started to fade rapidly over time, and clearly JSON/RESTful services had won. Most of the microservice implementations we see today follow RESTful design principles.</p><p>In the last two to three years, we’ve seen a genuine interest from many companies we’ve worked with to move into microservices architecture, and projects starting from scratch are adopting microservices principles. Most of the early adopters of microservices just wanted to get things done, and worried mostly about implementing functional requirements. They didn’t worry too much about security, although they should have. In many cases, securing microservices would mean securing the interactions among microservices with Transport Layer Security (TLS), and may be, for some, enforcing mutual TLS for service-to-service authentication. But none of them are quite adequate. There are two main reasons many didn’t worry much about security: complexity and awareness.</p><p>Some time back, we found that most tools for securing microservices were not easy to use or couldn’t address the challenges specific to microservices deployments. This complexity was a barrier to securing microservices. At the same time, people who didn’t put much effort into security weren’t fully aware of the risks. We started hearing these stories from many of our customers as well as from the extended open source community we work with. That motivated us to write this book on securing microservices. Bringing an idea from inception to reality takes considerable time and&nbsp;effort.</p><p>We lived with this idea of writing a book for more than two years until Manning reached out to us. During that period, with the increased adoption of microservices, the infrastructure around microservices security also&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>Writing a book about a rapidly evolving domain is bit of a challenge; you never know when your book will be obsolete. After discussing this challenge with the publisher, we decided to put more weight on principles and patterns, and use tools just to demonstrate how to apply those principles and patterns in practice. This was our ground rule in picking up the technology stack for the book. We use Spring Boot / Java to develop all the samples, though we don’t expect you to know either Java or Spring Boot in detail. If you have development experience in any programming language, you should be able to follow all the samples in the book with no difficulty.</p><p>Security itself is a larger domain. Securing microservices can mean different things to different people, based on their experiences and expectations. This fact was highlighted by one of the reviewers of the book, who comes from a security testing background.</p><p>In our book, we wanted to focus on managing access to microservices. In other words, we wanted to focus on securing access to microservices with authentication and authorization. So, the book doesn’t talk about protecting microservices against different types of attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>After a marathon effort that spanned slightly more than two years, we are glad to see that our book on microservices security is out. We are also excited that this is the very first book on securing microservices. We hope you will enjoy reading&nbsp;it!</p><p>The book has five sections and 13 chapters. Part 1 takes you through the fundamentals in securing microservices:</p>  Chapter 1 teaches you why securing microservices is challenging, and takes you through the key principles in securing a microservices deployment.  Chapter 2 teaches you how to build your first microservice in Spring Boot and secure it with OAuth 2.0. You will also learn how to set up an OAuth 2.0 token&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Part 2 takes you through securing a microservice at the edge (or entry point) in a typical microservices deployment:</p>  Chapter 3 takes you through the consumer landscape of your microservices and teaches you how to deploy a Spring Boot microservice behind the Zuul API gateway. You will also learn how to enforce OAuth 2.0-based security at the Zuul API&nbsp;gateway.  Chapter 4 teaches you how to develop a single-page application (SPA) with Angular. You will also learn how to secure a SPA with OpenID&nbsp;Connect.  Chapter 5 teaches you how to extend the use case you built in chapter 4 by engaging throttling, monitoring, and access control at the Zuul API&nbsp;gateway.  <p>Part 3 takes you through the process of securing interactions among microservices once a request from a client application passes through the security at the edge and enters into your microservices deployment:</p>  Chapter 6 teaches you how to secure communications among microservices that take place over HTTP, with mutual Transport Layer Security&nbsp;(mTLS).  In chapter 7, you learn how to share contextual data (for example, the end user context) among microservices by using JSON Web Token&nbsp;(JWT).  Chapter 8 teaches you how to secure communications among microservices that take place over gRPC, with mTLS and&nbsp;JWT.  Chapter 9 teaches you how to secure reactive microservices. It also teaches you how to set up Kafka as a message broker, and how to enforce access-control policies for Kafka&nbsp;topics.  <p>Part 4 takes you through deploying and securing microservices in a containerized environment:</p>  Chapter 10 teaches you how to deploy your microservices in Docker and to secure service-to-service interactions with mTLS and JWT. You also learn some of the built-in security features related to&nbsp;Docker.  Chapter 11 teaches you how to deploy your microservices as Docker containers in Kubernetes and to secure service-to-service communications with JWT over&nbsp;mTLS.  Chapter 12 teaches you how to offload the security processing overhead from your microservices by using the Istio service&nbsp;mesh.  <p>Part 5 takes you through security testing in the development process:</p>  Chapter 13 teaches you how to automate security testing of your microservices with SonarQube, Jenkins, and OWASP&nbsp;ZAP.  <p>In general, you should be sure to read the first two chapters so that you have the right mindset to take on the challenges of securing microservices and that you’ve gotten your feet wet and are ready to build more complex security patterns, which the book teaches you. The appendices provide information on OAuth 2.0, JWT, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Open Policy Agent (OPA), and SPIFFE. This information supplements the chapters.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/microservices-security-in-action-933072043ad7">Microservices Security in Action</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 datasette-copyable 

<p>Datasette has long provided CSV and JSON export, but when you're working with smaller amounts of data it's often most convenient to move that data around using copy and paste.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-copyable">datasette-copyable</a> uses Datasette's <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-output-renderer-datasette">register_output_renderer()</a> plugin hook to add a whole plethora of new export options, powered by the excellent <a href="https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate">tabulate</a> Python library (which I'm also <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#running-queries-and-outputting-a-table">using in sqlite-utils</a>).</p>

<p>The default output format is TSV, because if you copy tab-separated values to your clipboard and then hit paste on a cell in Google Sheets, Excel or Numbers the data will be imported directly into your spreadsheet, preserving the columns and rows!</p>

<p>The other supported formats are everything that <code>tabulate</code> supports - LaTeX, GitHub Markdown, MediaWiki, JIRA and more.</p>

<p>You can try the plugin out on some New York Times Covid-19 data (for Harris county, Texas) <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties.copyable?state=Texas&amp;county=Harris">over here</a>.</p>

 datasette-insert-api 

<p>Ever since Datasette plugins <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Feb/26/weeknotes-datasette-writes/">gained the ability to write to the database</a> back in February I've been looking forward to building something that really put it through its paces.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert-api">datasette-insert-api</a> is a relatively thin wrapper around my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> Python library which unlocks a powerful set of functionality:</p>

  POST a JSON array to Datasette to insert those objects as rows in a database table  If the table does not yet exist, Datasette can create it with the corresponding columns  If the table exists and has a primary key, records with matching primary keys can replace existing rows (a simple form of update)  If unknown columns are present in the data, the plugin can optionally alter the table to add the necessary columns  

<p>The README <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert-api/blob/main/README.md">has the details</a>, but the simplest example of it in action (using <code>curl</code>) looks like this:</p>

 <code>curl --request POST \
  --data '[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Cleopaws",
        "age": 5
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Pancakes",
        "age": 4
    }
    ]' \
  'http://localhost:8001/-/insert/data/dogs?pk=id'</code> 

<p>The plugin works without authentication - useful for piping JSON into a database on your own laptop - or you can couple it with a plugin such as <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a> to provide authenticated access over the public internet.</p>

 Speaking at Boston Python 

<p>I gave a talk about Datasette and <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> for <a href="https://about.bostonpython.com/">Boston Python</a> on Wednesday. Ned turned around the video really quickly - I start talking at 8 minutes and 52 seconds in.</p>



<p>I used a collaborative Google Doc for the Q&amp;A which worked really well, as the questions accumulated while I was presenting and I then got to address them at the end. I spent some time after the talk fleshing out my answers with extra links - here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEmgp32UBbN0xM4Sg36T13sh0knilGen4S66mMNjtjg/edit">the resulting document</a>.</p>

 Upgrading this blog to Django 3.1 

<p>The first <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2020/jul/20/django-31-release-candidate-1-released/">Django 3.1 release candidate</a> came out earlier this week, and I've upgraded my blog to this (a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/65e77ef2b8d73579ceb2716248dc36dd44a47727">one-line change</a> I made through the GitHub web interface thanks to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/17/free-continuous-deployment/">Heroku continuous deployment</a>).</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/heroku/pg-upgrade.md">upgraded my Heroku PostgreSQL database</a> to v11 so I could take advantage of the new <code>search_type="websearch"</code> option for PostgreSQL full-text search added in Django 3.1 - James Turk contributed that improvement and <a href="https://jamesturk.net/posts/websearch-in-django-31/">wrote about it on his blog</a>.</p>

<p>This means my blog search engine now supports advanced operators, like "phrase searches" and -subtractions - try that out here: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=%22signed+cookies%22+-django">"signed cookies" -django</a>.</p>

 content-length and datasette-clone progress bars 

<p>When Datasette runs against an immutable SQLite database it lets you download that database file directly. Datasette development version now <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/905">includes a content-length header</a> specifying the size of that download.</p>

<p>... which means my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-clone">datasette-clone tool</a> can now show you a progress bar!</p>

 <code>$ datasette-clone https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com -v
Fetching fivethirtyeight.db, current hash 7ba632a14f29375c289d96400947e2d5fcdad3a4b5a90883d6286bd4e83ede78 != None

 github-to-sqlite tags 

<p>I wanted to build myself a SQL query to show me my GitHub repositories that have commits which have not yet been included in a release.</p>

<p>It turned out I needed to build a new import command for this: <code>github-to-sqlite tags github.db simonw/datasette</code> - which fetches all of the tags for the specified repository.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/issues/43">relevant issue</a> and here's a monstrous SQL query that shows me repositories with commits that are ready to be shipped in a release:</p>

 <code>with most_recent_releases as (
  with ranked as (
    select
      repo,
      tag_name,

      row_number() OVER (

        ORDER BY
          published_at DESC
      ) rank
    FROM
      releases
  )
  select
    *
  from
    ranked
  where
    rank = 1
)
select
  repos.full_name as repo,
  most_recent_releases.tag_name as release,

    where

  ) as commits_since_release,

<p>I almost titled this blog post "dick-swinging isn't leadership".</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity">Toxic masculinity</a> is highly prevalent in business culture. If we accept that one of the primary roles of a manager is to create the conditions for your team to do your best work, it's something that we need to watch out for and put a stop to early. Speaking for myself, it's also exhausting: I'd rather work on a team that is empathetic, compassionate, and collaborative than one that is competitive, unemotional, and aggressive.</p><p>It's important to distinguish toxic masculinity from masculinity: I'm not at all saying that men can't be empathetic, compassionate, and collaborative. Those are certainly qualities I try (however imperfectly) to cultivate in myself. I'm also not buying into the malformed idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_essentialism">gender essentialism</a>, which posits that some qualities are fixed and core to women and men. Nonetheless, a lot of men have been conditioned to believe they need to be stoic and competitive; that dominance is a positive characteristic. The go-to insult of the anti-feminist alt-right is "cuck": a man who is perceived to be weak or servile. It's an idea that hurts men as much as women, and is one of the reasons that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190313-why-more-men-kill-themselves-than-women">men commit suicide 3-4 times more often than women</a>.</p><p>Because of historic inequities that may take generations to untangle, men still dominate boardrooms, and we bring our underdeveloped emotional intelligence with us. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/women-sexism-work-huffington-kamala-harris.html">We talk over women</a> and question their competence (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/women-men-competence.html">although this is finally beginning to change</a>). Men also tend to underestimate people who bring a more collaborative energy: someone who isn't aggressive, or is even less self-assured or simply an introvert, is likely to have less space to contribute during meetings, and may be regarded less highly overall within the company. Collaboration and creativity suffer.</p><p>It compounds when two subscribers to toxic masculinity clash (whether they're conscious or unconscious subscribers doesn't matter). Tempers will rise, recriminations rebound, and voices are raised. It creates a culture where disagreements are frowned upon, or where people who shy away from visceral conflict are less able to contribute.</p><p>The solution isn't that people who are more conflict-averse should become more assertive. It certainly isn't that women should become more like men, or that everyone should learn the skills of toxic masculinity. The only path towards creating a collaborative working environment is to respect everyone in the room, intentionally give them equal footing to speak. <a href="https://thisisfranklin.com/2018/02/22/how-to-run-inclusive-meetings.html">As Franklin Hu puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It’s the meeting moderator’s job to both create a psychologically safe environment and ensure that participants have an equal opportunity to contribute. Shaping the environment that meetings happen in helps to lower the barrier for people to contribute in meetings by hopefully eliminating entire classes of extrinsic factors that may dissuade individuals.</p></blockquote><p>By creating an inclusive culture, and specifically calling out toxic masculinity when we see it, we can ensure everyone can contribute, build a more highly-functioning team, improve our company's prospects, and have a better time at work.</p>

<p></p><p>I grew up writing. As a child, I would wake up early every morning to write stories with my plastic Parker fountain pen before school. We always had reams of paper on our dining room table, lying in wait.<br><br>I learned to code not because I loved discrete logic or the power of algorithms, but because I decided that computers could help me tell stories in a different way. For me, the best source code has a narrative flow, which in turn operates in service of the narrative of the user. Code is an expressive, creative, human medium - but only if it is used to tell a story.<br><br>Stories are important.<br><br>In a novel, the story finds its compelling core from the tension between the main character's inner goals and an important change in their external context. For example, take an alien invasion in isolation: while it's a dramatic setting, it's not particularly compelling in a vacuum. But let's zoom in on the main character. Maybe they've lost a loved one through an act of violence, which has made them want to shy away from any kind of conflict and keep to themselves. Unfortunately, now they happen to be the only person who holds the key to stopping the alien invasion - if they can only rise to the occasion. <br><br>It's a far more interesting story. An alien invasion itself isn't compelling, despite the pyrotechnics; what draws you in is the human story of someone who undergoes a personal transformation because of the invasion. We're naturally empathetic animals; we care about other people. We relate to the process of human change on a deep emotional level more than we relate to abstract ideas.<br><br>It took me a long time to understand this.<br><br>Startups, too, have a story. Just as a novel needs to be character-focused, a startup's idea alone isn't enough. Don't get me wrong, you need a smart idea - but for your startup to be a truly compelling prospect, you need to tell the human story of someone who undergoes a personal transformation because of what you've built. You have to imagine the novel of your venture.<br><br>My first venture, Elgg, was a stroke of luck. We had no idea what we were doing. Perhaps because of that, we fell back on the fundamentals of story: we tried hard to understand the internal needs of our customers and their external context, and built a product to address them at the intersection.<br><br>My second venture as a co-founder, Known, was not so lucky. Instead of centering it on real human needs, we built something that we thought should exist in the world. We centered our own desires, and I failed to get out of the way of my own ego. The result was that while Elgg is still in use, and was used by governments, non-profits, and corporations around the world, Known was never able to find escape velocity. It was intellectually driven and founded on a good idea (it's really dangerous for everyone in the world to get their news and post their social activity on just a handful of platforms), but was never able to find its emotional center. Because the story was missing, it was never truly compelling to us, let alone anyone else. So it floundered.<br><br>Imagine an accounting service. Is your heart racing yet? <br><br>Probably not. (Sorry, accountants.)<br><br>But now, let's talk about the main character. Imagine someone who owns a small business in the middle of the country. This company was already stretched thin because of widening income inequality, and now has to stretch even further to make ends meet because of the pandemic. Financial hardship means that employees sometimes don't show up for work because they can't afford to fix their car, or because childcare is out of reach for them. The business owner genuinely cares: they've been making one-time loans and running a hardship fund to bridge the gap. But if they're not careful, they'll run out of money, and everyone will be out of work - so they need to find creative ways to provide help to employees and stay in business.<br><br>This far more compelling story sits at the intersection of the top-down trends (the financial situation, the pandemic) and the bottom-up needs (business owners need to help in order to keep their employees but are having trouble finding the funds). It's a tightrope. Given enough specificity, we can be made to feel the business owner's pain.<br><br>The customer (here, the business owner) is the first character in the story. The startup (here, the accounting service) is the second. First, the customer is introduced, complete with internal need and external pressure. Then the startup is introduced: a group of humans who provide a solution for both the need and the pressure (a one-click way to help find hidden reserves of funding employee assistance programs, at a negligible cost). They meet somehow (the "discovery moment") and ride off into the sunset together, living happily ever after. The customer's pain is solved. The startup's value is proven.<br><br>Of course, if this was a pitch, the startup would have to talk about how it's going to meet millions of these customers and grow like wildfire because it meets their needs so well. In turn, it meets their needs because the product is built in service of a business strategy that is informed by empathy. It's not built to be something for everyone: it's built to service the deeply-held needs of a specific group of customers.<br><br>In my time as an early-stage investor, I saw how important that human understanding is. The founders who could get out of their own way and be led by their understanding of the people they were serving are the ones who were more likely to win. The founders and coders who thought they were the smartest people in the room and didn't try to find a deeper understanding were the ones who found themselves in trouble.<br><br>I've been both kinds of founder. It's a lesson you only need to learn once.<br><br>The key to story is that it's all about people: how they change and grow. If your novel doesn't hinge on that, nobody's going to read to the end. If your business doesn't hinge on that, nobody's going to care what you do - not even your own team. The first step is to find out who your characters are, and understand them as deeply as you can. Then, tell a specific, visceral story that your entire community can rally behind.<br><br>These days, I don't need reams of paper sitting on the dining room table, but I still wake up early to write stories. Being able to use imagination and empathy as building blocks feels like a gift. As it turns out, it's one we all have access to. We just need to read more, and care more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@californong?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Nong Vang</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/storytelling?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

The fifth was Hale-Bopp, which I blogged about <a href="http://searls.com/comets.html">here</a>, along with details on the previous four, in 1997. The sixth is NEOWISE, and that’s it, above, shot with my iPhone 11. There are a couple other shots in that same album, taken with my Canon 5D Mark III. Those are sharper, but this one shows off better.</p>
<p>Hey, if the comet looks this good over the lights of Los Angeles, you might have a chance to see it wherever you are tonight. It’ll be under the Big Dipper in the western sky.</p>
<p>Every night it will be a bit dimmer and farther away, so catch it soon. Best view is starting about an hour after sunset.</p>

<p>It's impossible to ignore.<br><br>Federal agents dressed in military gear have been bundling protesters into unmarked vehicles (allegedly rented from Enterprise) in Portland, with additional reports from Chicago and San Diego. The White House has announced that they'll be rolling these troops out nationwide.<br><br>Reports suggest that these agents are run by the Department of Homeland Security under the same law that allows the Federal Protective Service (also a DHS agency) to protect federal facilities. ICE, CBP, and FPS are now effectively a federal political police force, operating at the whim of the President.<br><br>At the same time, the President told Fox News this weekend that he isn't necessarily going to accept the result of the election if he loses, in part because of mail-in ballots. He's been drumming the mail-in ballot line for months now, despite there being no evidence of voter fraud using this method. We're in the middle of a pandemic: of course there will be an increase in mail-in voting. It's certainly how I plan to do it. By seeding the idea that this kind of voting is fraudulent in a year when a huge proportion of votes will be cast this way, the administration opens the door to deny the outcome of the election.<br><br>Such an act would be the end of the American experiment. America depends on the government making way for its constitutionally-elected successor; without this mechanism, there is no democracy, and there is no representation. The richest country in the world, with by far the world's largest military, would be under the direct control of Donald Trump.<br><br>It sounds like science fiction. It rhymes with a Philip K Dick story. But here we are.<br><br>"It can't happen here" doesn't carry any weight anymore, if it ever did. It is. It would be easy to dismiss the rhetoric as bluster if it weren't for the troops in our cities, the concentration camps on our borders, and the corrupt profiteering eating away at our institutions.<br><br>Which isn't to say that those institutions were in any way perfect. I think people like to believe in the theory that Trump is a Russian asset because they like to think that nothing like this could be American. But this is a country of Jim Crow and domestic assassinations; it's the country that aided in the Iranian revolution and paid Osama bin Laden to build an army. This kind of fascism is as American as apple pie (which is to say, invented in Europe and coated with a little extra sugar). I'm not, to be clear, saying that Trump isn't necessarily a foreign asset. But it certainly isn't a given that he is; divisiveness and bigotry have been a part of the culture since the Europeans invaded.<br><br>I can see a few possible futures, all unfolding like a slow-motion train wreck.<br><br>In the first, Trump wins the election fair and square, and considers his re-election to be a mandate. Don't discount it.<br><br>In the second, he loses to Biden, and concedes. People with a sense of human decency everywhere rejoice. And then either the Democrats rapidly undo as much of the last four years as they can, or disappointingly squander those first two years in power as its conservative wing desperately fights against the improvements demanded by its progressive wing.<br><br>In the third, he loses to Biden and doesn't concede. This is the one where America ends. At the point where an election is meaningless, democracy is meaningless. The modern day version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933">Reichstag passing the Enabling Act</a> under the threat of the gun is passing emergency powers under the threat of information about our representatives being made public.<br><br>I would like to be wrong.<br><br>I would also like all this to be over.<br><br>I would like to not be thinking about what to do if the third future comes to pass.<br><br>But it's very hard to ignore, and to concentrate on the details of the rest of our lives while this unfolds as we stand by, powerless.<br><br>We're not quite powerless, of course. We can still vote (and we must). We can support institutions like <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">the ACLU</a> that fight for our freedoms. We can support journalism, which more than ever is the vital connective tissue for democratic society. We can march. And we can use our own voices, in our own spaces and with our own communities, to raise the alarm.</p>

  <p>All sorts of project updates this week.</p>

 datasette-auth-passwords 

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">Datasette 0.44</a> added authentication support as a core concept, but left the actual implementation details up to the plugins.</p>

<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-passwords">datasette-auth-passwords</a> on Monday. It's an implementation of the most obvious form of authentication (as opposed to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github">GitHub SSO</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens">bearer tokens</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-existing-cookies">existing domain cookies</a>): usernames and passwords, typed into a form.</p>

<p>Implementing passwords responsibly is actually pretty tricky, due to the need to effectively hash them. After <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-passwords/issues/1">some research</a> I ended up mostly copying how Django does it (never a bad approach): I'm using 260,000 salted pbkdf2_hmac iterations, taking advantage of the Python standard library. I wrote this up <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/python/password-hashing-with-pbkdf2.md">in a TIL</a>.</p>

<p>The plugin currently only supports hard-coded password hashes that are fed to Datasette via an environment variable - enough to set up a password-protected Datasette instance with a couple of users, but not really good for anything more complex than that. I have an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-passwords/issues/6">open issue</a> for implementing database-backed password accounts, although again the big challenge is figuring out how to responsible store those password hashes.</p>

<p>I've set up a live demo of the password plugin at <a href="https://datasette-auth-passwords-demo.datasette.io/">datasette-auth-passwords-demo.datasette.io</a> - you can sign into it to reveal a private database that's only available to authenticated users.</p>

 Datasette website and logo 

<p>I'm finally making good progress on a website for Datasette. As part of that I've been learning to use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, which I used to create a Datasette logo.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Figma is really neat: it's an entirely web-based vector image editor, aimed at supporting the kind of design work that goes into websites and apps. It has full collaborative editing for teams but it's free for single users. Most importantly it has <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/with-figmas-new-svg-exports-less-more/">extremely competent SVG exports</a>.</p>

<p>I've added the logo to <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">the latest version</a> of the Datasette docs, and I have an <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/pull/978">open pull request</a> to <code>sphinx_rtd_theme</code> to add support for setting a custom link target on the logo so I can link back to the rest of the official site, when it goes live.</p>

 TIL search snippet highlighting 

<p>My <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TIL site</a> has a search engine, but it didn't do snippet highlighting. I reused the pattern I described in <a href="https://24ways.org/2018/fast-autocomplete-search-for-your-website/">Fast Autocomplete Search for Your Website</a> - implemented server-side rather than client-side this time - to add that functionality. The implementation <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/commit/51f5daef61b6bbe6c5be564b8644d2bff6761ab0">is here</a> - here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/search?q=asgi">a demo</a> of it in action.</p>

 SRCCON schedule 

<p>I'm attending (virtually) the <a href="https://2020.srccon.org/">SRCCON 2020</a> journalism conference this week, and Datasette is part of the <a href="https://2020.srccon.org/projects-products-research/#datasette">Projects, Products, &amp; Research</a> track.</p>

<p>As a demo, I set up a Datasette powered copy of the conference schedule at <a href="https://srccon-2020.datasette.io/">srccon-2020.datasette.io</a> - it's running the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a> plugin which means it can provide a URL that can be subscribed to in Google or Apple Calendar.</p>

<p>The site runs out of the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/srccon-2020-datasette">simonw/srccon-2020-datasette</a> repository, which uses a GitHub Action to download the schedule JSON, modify it a little (mainly to turn the start and end dates into ISO datestamps), save it to a SQLite database with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a> and publish it to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</p>

 Covid 19 population data 

<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Mar/11/covid-19/">Covid-19 tracker</a> publishes updated numbers of cases and deaths from the New York Times, the LA Times and Johns Hopkins university on an hourly basis.</p>

<p>One thing that was missing was county population data. US counties are identified in the data by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code">FIPS codes</a>, which offers a mechanism for joining against population estimates pulled from the US Census.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/pull/155">Aaron King</a> I've now incorporated that data into the site, as a new <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/us_census_county_populations_2019">us_census_county_populations_2019</a> table.</p>

<p>I used that data to define a SQL view - <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/latest_ny_times_counties_with_populations">latest_ny_times_counties_with_populations</a> - which shows the latest New York Times county data with new derived  	<code>cases_per_million</code> and <code>deaths_per_million</code> columns.</p>

 Tweaks to this blog 

<p>For many years this blog's main content has sat on the left of the page - which looks increasingly strange as screens get wider and wider. As of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/3d44c67a2cfee128d0168cb2e6a650f45211446a">this commit</a> the main layout is centered, which I think looks much nicer.</p>

<p>I also ran <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/b085679933985c44b8171b556d141cdef8f232d2">a data migration</a> to fix some old internal links.</p>

 Miscellaneous 

<p>I gave a (virtual) talk at <a href="https://www.djangolondon.com/">Django London</a> on Monday about Datasette. I've taken to sharing a Google Doc for this kind of talk, which I prepare before the talk with notes and then update afterwards to reflect additional material from the Q&amp;A. Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZDlxHOqDGugKqn_Nh_Q7JER5vjKin1D3d17oPhrs9o/edit">the document</a> from Monday's talk.</p>

<p>San Francisco Public Works maintain a page of <a href="https://sfpublicworks.org/tree-removal-notifications">tree removal notifications</a> showing trees that are scheduled for removal. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/">like those trees</a>. They don't provide an archive of notifications from that page, so I've set up a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gitscraping/">git scraping</a> <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sfpublicworks-tree-removal-notifications">GitHub repository</a> that scrapes the page daily and maintains a history of its contents in the commit log.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-fly/releases/tag/1.0">datasette-publish-fly</a> for compatibility with Datasette 0.44 and Python 3.6.</p>

<p>I made a few tweaks to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">my GitHub profile README</a>, which is now Apache 2 licensed so people know they can adapt it for their own purposes.</p>

<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/releases/tag/2.3">github-to-sqlite 2.3</a> with a new option for fetching information for just specific repositories.</p>

<p>The Develomentor podcast published <a href="https://develomentor.com/2020/07/16/simon-willison-data-journalism-the-importance-of-side-projects/">an interview with me</a> about my career, and how it's been mostly defined by side-projects.</p>

<p></p><p>The European Court of Justice <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53418898">just struck down a key data-sharing deal between the US and EU</a> because the US sees fit to spy on the world.</p><p>Privacy Shield was a mechanism that allowed US tech companies to operate in the EU using a blanket agreement. By <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Join-Privacy-Shield-part-1">creating a compliant privacy policy and self-certifying</a>, they could operate within Europe's tighter personal data protection environment. It operated like a kind of safe harbor program: there was no need to create a privacy policy specifically for EU residents, and companies that complied with its principles could assume that they were operating within the law. GDPR fines start at the higher of <a href="https://gdpr.eu/fines/">10 million Euros or 2% of the company's worldwide revenues in the preceding year</a>, so this was both a legally and financially meaningful protection.</p><p>It was knocked down on Thursday because of America's mass surveillance programs.</p><p>In November, 2017, President Trump issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13768">an executive order</a> which, among other things, made it clear that US privacy law would only protect US citizens and "lawful permanent residents" (in other words, surveillance of non-citizens living elsewhere or undocumented immigrants is permitted):</p><blockquote><p>Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.</p></blockquote><p>This was effectively a clarification of existing policy rather than a new regulation. Because agencies like the NSA have historically had no restrictions on collecting data about overseas foreigners, tech companies that transmitted personal data into the US would be exposing that data to broad surveillance in violation of EU law. As we know from whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964">those surveillance powers are often used on US citizens too</a>, and information sharing between the US and UK allowed intelligence agencies to skirt around privacy laws in both countries.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/the-irish-times-view-on-gdpr-bigger-than-beyonc%C3%A9-1.3507432">undoubtedly imperfect</a>, GDPR had a very positive side effect: although it only pertained to EU residents, its effects were felt worldwide. It's not feasible to create one data storage protocol for one set of users and another for others, so in effect, at many tech companies, all user data was held in a way that complied with the legislation.</p><p>Here, too, the effects are likely to be felt worldwide. In addition to the existing compelling moral case, there's now a strong business case for international corporations to push for an end to mass surveillance: the loss of Privacy Shield is a real risk to their bottom lines. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-court-strikes-down-privacy-shield-122942268.html">As privacy activist Max Schrems, who originally brought the case, put it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As the EU will not change its fundamental rights to please the NSA, the only way to overcome this clash is for the US to introduce solid privacy rights for all people – including foreigners. Surveillance reform thereby becomes crucial for the business interests of Silicon Valley.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/11/18/rules-new-surveillance-reality">Mass surveillance is a human rights abuse</a> that has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/when-surveillance-chills-speech-new-studies-show-our-rights-free-association">a measurable chilling effect on free speech and democracy</a>. <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/">Surveillance capitalism</a> has long been a go-to business model for tech startups, although this has been slowly changing during the last few years, in part because of pressure surrounding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest">human rights abuses by agencies like ICE</a>, but also because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/targeted-ads-offer-little-extra-value-for-online-publishers-study-suggests/">targeted advertising turns out to be less valuable than hoped</a>. Anything that further aligns the business community with an individual's human right to privacy is good news.</p><p>Meanwhile, US legislators continue to work to erode our privacy. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text">The EARN IT Act</a> will pressure tech companies to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/tell-your-senator-vote-no-earn-it-act">eliminate end-to-end encryption so that communications can be directly surveilled</a>. It serves as a stark contrast to the Privacy Shield ruling, and a reminder of the wildly divergent priorities on either side of the Atlantic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chrisyangchrisfilm?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Chris Yang</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/surveillance?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

  <p>All the discussion has been around how to limit new infections, and how to cope for as long as
COVID-19 has no cure. It’s been terrible enough, particularly in shockingly incompetent countries like the US.
We’ve consoled ourselves with the hope that even if things are terrible now, science is working hard on a
vaccine, and even if it takes a year or more, one day we will have one, we get everybody injected, and then
the pandemic nightmare is over and we can go back to normal.</p>
<p>Based on recent news, we may have to rethink that plan. If it indeed turns out that
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6">antibodies disappear within months from infected people</a>,
chances are that antibodies will also disappear from vaccinated people.
Which would make vaccination, should a vaccine be found, only effective for a few months.</p>
<p>Which would mean you’d have to re-vaccinate every, say, 6 months. In a country the size of the US,
you’d have to vaccinate, say, 200 million people (herd immunity) every 6 months, which means
2 million vaccinations every single business day.</p>
<p>I don’t think that works. And it certainly does not work in poorer countries with less infrastructure.</p>
<p>So there is now a real possibility that COVID-19 will not go away. And even if we were willing to accept
the death rate on a permanent basis, it’s hard to believe we could accept the 10x larger number of
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2020/06/13/report-suggests-some-mildly-symptomatic-covid-19-patients-endure-serious-long-term-effects">permanently injured people</a> that results.</p>
<p>Which would mean that the current state of affairs would become permanent:</p>
 
 severely curtailed long-distance travel, with long mandatory quarantines upon entry; 
 no large / mass events ever again; 
 far less in-person contact than we’ve been used to as a species; 
 contact tracing and mandatory quarantines as core functions of government, and probably
not very gentle ones at that; 
 fewer vacations, with a much smaller range of possible vacation activities; 
 entire industries become non-viable. 
 
<p>Certain? No. Possible? Entirely. We may want to start considering this as a real possibility.</p>

My first attempt at the <a href="https://ondemand.thestand.co.uk/Video/EGMEGL/the_cabaret_of_dangerous_ideas">Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas</a>. Scary…</p>
<p>I was nervous and I know I could have conveyed my thoughts with more clarity and coherence. I virtually missed out my section on trust - our way of navigating the uncertainties of our environment. Still, I am grateful for the opportunity and everyone who helped make it happen. I largely enjoyed myself. And I learnt a lot. I look forward to hopefully attempting a full show next year!</p>
<p>My show, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/in-control">#AreYouInControl?</a>, was an attempt to condense and convey a period of reflection into the role and impact identity technology in the complex system that is human society. A web of relationships and influence that limit and expand the possibilities of individuals as they navigate uncertainty and seek to optimise some values perceived to be important in a given context at a given moment in time and space. </p>
<p>My background is not in social science, I research digital identity, privacy and to lesser extent cryptography. The digital world represents this fascinatingly tangled mesh of human social and economic interaction. It has infinitely expanded the set of possible possibilities. The fact that we could run a virtual show is a testament to the expansion of capabilities to interact. It has also created new risks - privacy, security, surveillance, manipulation. And new constraints on interaction, the set of characters and emojis we can use to communicate with, the mechanisms we use to identify and authenticate others, the set of possible actions a platform supports.</p>
<p>These new environments that we exist within are no longer inanimate, they are designed, developed and populated by human beings. The environment has become a source of data, a digital representation of collective memory. Whether intentionally or not, the constraints, risks and possibilities emergent in these virtual spaces are perceived subjectively by each of us. There can be little doubt that these systems present powerful mechanisms for influence at the individual, group and societal level.</p>
<p>The challenge that we must all grapple with, is power to who? For what purpose? Who decides?</p>
<p>Digital technology is neither good nor bad. It is up to us to decide the values these virtual spaces incentivise, what rules they enforce, who they benefit and how they can be changed.</p>
<p>So are you in control?</p>
<p>No, but is control something we should aspire for?. Uncertainty and independent thought is <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3620295.html">the difference that makes a difference</a> in our complex human system. We should embrace it and protect it.</p>
<p>Instead of control, we should strive for influence and agency driven through intention and the freedom from the intrusive influence of others intentionally kept beyond our awareness. I am interested in technology that can foster cooperation, participation and democratic governance among individuals so they can become empowered agents for change in our society.</p>
<p>I am not sure how much of the above I managed to convey. What can I say, I certainly was not in control despite the influence I attempted to exert through practice and preparation.</p>

 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72157694493013900"></a><p>These are among the since-demolished towers of the once-mighty WMEX/1510 radio in Boston.</p> 
<p>The question on Quora was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-a-radio-station-last-on-average">How long does a radio station last on average?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-a-radio-station-last-on-average/answer/Doc-Searls">Here is my answer</a>, which also addresses the bigger question of what will happen to radio itself.</p>
 
<p>Radio station licenses will last as long as they have value to the owners—or that regulators allow them to persist. Call signs (aka call letters) come and go, as do fashions around them.* But licenses are the broadcasting equivalent of real estate. Their value is holding up, but it won’t forever.</p>
<p>Arguing for persistence is the simple fact that many thousands of radio station licenses have been issued since the 1920s, and the vast majority of those are still in use.</p>
<p>Arguing for their mortality, however, are signs of rot, especially on the AM band, where many stations are shrinking—literally, with smaller signals and coverage areas—and some are dying. Four reasons for that:</p>
 
 FM and digital media sound much better. Electrical (and especially computer) noise also infects all but the strongest signals. It also doesn’t help that the AM radios in most new cars sound like the speakers are talking through a pillow. 
 Syndicated national programming is crowding out the local kind. This is due to consolidation of ownership in the hands of a few large companies (e.g. Entercom, Cumulus, iHeart) and to the shift of advertising money away from local radio. The independent local AM (and even FM) station is in the same economic pickle as the independent local newspaper. 
 AM transmission tends to come from towers, or collections of them, on many acres of land. Now, as suburbs spread and the value of real estate goes up,&nbsp;the land under many AM transmitters exceeds the value of the stations themselves. A typical example is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDWN">KDWN/720</a>&nbsp;in Las Vegas. Since it was born in 1975, KDWN has been 50,000 watts day and night (the legal max), with a night signal that blanketed the whole West Coast. But, in the last year, the station moved a site where it can share another station’s towers, downscaling the signal to just 25,000 watts by day and 7,500 watts by night. <a title="goo.gl" href="https://goo.gl/maps/uNA2JDMtuPt5tQUbA">Here is a 2019 Google StreetView</a>&nbsp;of the old site, with a For Sale sign. Also note also that KDWN now identifies as “<a title="kdwn.com" href="https://kdwn.com/">101.5 FM / 720 AM – The Talk of Las Vegas</a> .” The 101.5 is its 250-watt translator (signal repeater), known legally as <a href="http://K268CS">K268CS</a>. From its perch atop&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strat_(Las_Vegas)">The Strat</a>&nbsp;(formerly the Stratosphpere) on The Strip, the translator puts out a good-enough FM signal to <a href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=K268CS&amp;service=FX">cover</a> the heart of the Las Vegas metro. Today many AM stations exist only as an excuse to operate FM translators like this one. Even fully successful AM stations play this new game.&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBBM_(AM">WBBM/780</a>, the legacy all-news station that (rarely among AMs) is still ranked #1 in the&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb005">Nielsen Ratings for Chicago</a>, sold the land under its old towers and now shares the towers of another station, where it radiates with less power. 
 In the Battle of the Bands, FM won. For evidence, look at the&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">Nielsen Audio Ratings for the Washington DC region</a>. Only two AMs show, and they’re at the bottom. One is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBQH">WBQH/1050</a>, a regional Mexican formatted station with an 0.2% share of listening and a signal that is only 44 watts at night. And most of the listening likely owes to the station’s 180-watt translator on 93.5fm. (Both only cover a few northside suburbs and the northern tip of DC.) The other station is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN">WSBN/630am</a>, a sports station with an 0.1% share: a number that couldn’t be lower without disappearing. That license was once&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN#Early_years">WMAL</a>, which <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/02/10/will-wmal-survive-losing-its-transmitter/">sold off the land under its towers</a> a few years ago, moving far out of town to “diplex” on the towers of yet another station that long ago sold the land under&nbsp;its original towers. That other station is now called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWRC">WWRC/570</a>. It’s a religious/conservative talker with no ratings that was once <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGMS_(Washington)#Early_history">WGMS</a>, famous in its glory years as a landmark classical station. 
 
<p>Despite this, the number of AM licenses in the U.S persist in the thousands, while the number of abandoned AM licenses number in the dozens. (The FCC’s&nbsp;<a title="www.fcc.gov" href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/silent-am-list">Silent AM Broadcast Stations List</a>&nbsp;is 83 stations long. The&nbsp;<a title="www.fcc.gov" href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/silent-fm-list">Silent FM Broadcast Stations List</a>&nbsp;is longer, but includes a lot of translators and LPFMs—low-power stations meant to serve a few zip codes at most. Also, neither list includes licenses that have been revoked or abandoned in the distant past, such as the once-legendary&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISN_(Vancouver,_Washington)">KISN</a>&nbsp;in Portland, Oregon.)</p>
<p>What I’ve reported so far applies only to the U.S. AM band, which is called MW (for mediumwave) in most of the rest of the world. In a lot of that world, AM/MW is being regulated away: abandoned by decree. That’s why it is gone, or close to it, in some European countries. Canada has also scaled back on AM, with the&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation">CBC</a> &nbsp;moving in many places exclusively to FM.</p>
<p>The news is less bad for FM, which has thrived since the 1970s, and now accounts for most over-the-air radio listening. The FCC has also done its best to expand the number of stations and signals on the FM band, especially in recent years through translators and LPFMs. In&nbsp;<a title="radio-locator.com" href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/locate?select=city&amp;city=las%2Bvegas%2C%2Bnv&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Radio-Locator’s list of stations you’ll recieve in Las Vegas</a>, 16 of the 59 listed signals are for translators and LPFMs. Meanwhile only 18 stations have listenable signals on AM, and some of those signals (such as KDWN’s) are smaller than they used to be.</p>
<p>Still, the effects of streaming and podcasting through the Internet will only increase. This is why so many stations, personalities, programming sources and station owners are rushing to put out as many streams and podcasts as possible. Today, every phone, pad and laptop is a receiver for every station with digital content of any kind, and there are many more entities competing for this “band” than radio stations alone.</p>
<p>While it’s possible that decades will pass before AM and FM are retired completely, it’s not hard to read the tea leaves. AM and FM are both gone now in Norway, which has switched to&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting">Digital Audio Broadcasting</a>, or DAB, as has much of the rest of Europe. (We don’t have DAB in the U.S., and thus far there is very little interest in it.)</p>
<p>Still, I don’t doubt that many of entities we call “stations” will persist without signals. Last summer we listened to local radio from Santa Barbara (mostly&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCLU-FM">KCLU</a>) while driving around Spain, just by jacking a phone into the dashboard and listening to Internet streams through the cellular data system. Even after all their transmitters get turned off, sometime in the far future, I’m sure KCLU will still be KCLU.</p>
<p>The process at work here is what the great media scholars&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>&nbsp;and his son&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_McLuhan">Eric</a> &nbsp;(in&nbsp;<a title="www.amazon.com" href="https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Media-Science-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0802077153">Laws of Media: The New Science</a>) call&nbsp;retrieval. What they mean is that every new medium retrieves the content of what it obsolesces. So, much as print retrieved writing and TV retrieved radio, the Internet retrieves damn near everything it obsolesces, including TV, radio, print, speech and you-name-it.</p>
<p>In most cases the old medium doesn’t go away. But broadcasting might be different, because it exists by grace of regulation, meaning governments&nbsp;can&nbsp;make them disappear. The FCC has already done that to much of the UHF TV band, auctioning off the best channels to cellular systems. This is why, for example, T-Mobile can brag about their new long-range “5G” coverage. They’re <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2019/12/02/t-mobile-nationwide-5g-launch-highlights-range-vs-speed/#691c0b89648d">getting that coverage</a> that over what used to be UHF TV channels that stations auctioned away. It’s also why, for example, when you watch&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLCS">KLCS</a>, channel 58 in Los Angeles, you’re actually watching channel 28, which the station shares with KCET, using the same site and transmitter. The Los Angeles Unified School District collected a cool $130,510,880 in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_auction">spectrum auction</a> for channel 58.</p>
<p>So, when listening to the AM and FM bands drops sufficiently, don’t assume the FCC won’t say, “Hey, all the stations that matter are streaming and podcasting on the Internet, so we’re going to follow the path of Norway.” When that happens, your AM and FM radios will be as useful as the heavy old TVs you hauled out to the curb a decade ago.</p>

CREDIT: © DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY / ALAMY/DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY /&nbsp;ALAMY This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</p> TL;DR:   Most organizations aren’t digitally connected to one another, creating “trust domain” barriers that are slow, manual, and expensive to traverse.  Similar to shipping containers, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can bridge trust domains between and within organizations, by using you as their&nbsp;courier.  The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains from many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear.   The Barriers VCs Can Bridge: Trust&nbsp;Domains <a href="https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region">https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region</a><p>Today, if you’re applying for a loan at your financial institution (FI) and need to prove your employment, how can you do so digitally, instantly? You can’t, in most cases. Why? Because it’s not feasible for every FI to have a direct, digital connection to every possible employer they may need data from. The same boundaries exist between schools, when a student transfers and desires to receive credit for classes taken: it’s untenable for every school to have a direct connection to every other&nbsp;school.</p><p>This leaves FI’s, employers, schools and other organizations in separate, unconnected trust domains, unable to directly exchange trusted data and reliant on manual processes, often through third-party data brokers acting as intermediaries. Exchanging data between trust domains today is analogous to the manual, labor-intensive “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo">break-bulk</a>” process used for millennia for all global trade prior to shipping containers, and is similarly slow, complicated, and expensive.</p><p>This is also why VC adoption may be resisted by incumbent data intermediaries as vigorously as <a href="https://www.discovercontainers.com/a-complete-history-of-the-shipping-container/">labor unions protested shipping containers</a>.</p><p>And this is the same reason we have so many usernames and passwords in the first place: there is no universal way to traverse trust domains in the digital realm. Identity federations within a single trust domain, like what’s offered by the current IAM industry to large organizations, solve this problem elegantly. But cross-domain identity federations, however, have repeatedly attempted to address this and <a href="http://lockstep.com.au/library/identity_authentication/the-false-allure-of-federated.html">failed for various reasons</a>, leaving the problem unresolved and ballooning.</p><p>The boundaries between digital trust domains are understandably high, as the stakes can be high, the risk of fraud ever-present, and fraudsters can comfortably apply their trade from anywhere. We know these boundaries well:</p>  Having many usernames and passwords  Cumbersome forms and onboarding processes  Verbally authenticating when calling a service center, and re-authenticating when being transferred  Waiting for agreements to be signed or consent to be&nbsp;given  Waiting for any kind of application to be&nbsp;approved  Slow verifications of any kind of documents, records  Many slow and/or tedious processes that rely on verifications  <p>Any time you are slowed down or prevented from doing something because you can’t quickly prove something, it’s a manifestation of boundaries between trust domains, much like the bygone situation in shipping that necessitated “break-bulk.” If gatekeepers, human or automated, could quickly verify everything they needed to verify, they could quickly open their&nbsp;gates.</p><p>With VCs, they now&nbsp;can.</p> How VCs Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains <p>This post already assumes a basic understanding of how VCs work, but at the risk of being redundant, I want readers to understand, mechanically, how VCs bridge trust&nbsp;domains.</p><a href="https://despair.com/products/dysfunction">https://despair.com/products/dysfunction</a><p>I think this ^^ is one of the funnier “demotivators” at despair.com, a site everyone should check out for a good laugh. As with most humor, what makes a demotivator funny is the thread of truth that runs through&nbsp;it.</p><p>The relevant truth in this poster is this: the only consistent feature in ALL of your relationships — not just your dissatisfying ones — is you. You are the common factor between all your employers, your FIs, your schools, and every other organization you deal with, and that makes you the ideal courier of data between&nbsp;them.</p><p>If only you had the data… and if only it could be trusted when you delivered it…</p><p>Well, this is where our super duper data shipping container comes in, the VC. Here’s how it all comes together:</p>  You start with an empty digital SSI wallet. Not the Apple kind or Android kind or anything else similarly proprietary and non-portable, but a standardized self-sovereign digital wallet that’s all yours, where you literally hold the digital keys to&nbsp;it.  You offer/accept connections to/from other people, organizations, or things using QR codes or other means of bootstrapping. These are peer-to-peer relationships that you now own and control, and not through some platform or company where they could be seen, controlled, or taken away from&nbsp;you.  When VCs are offered to you by your connections, you choose whether to accept them into your wallet. When you do, you’re now a “holder.” An entity who gives you a VC, whether person, organization, or thing, is called an “issuer.”  When you want to prove something to someone, or share verifiable data, you must first connect with them (#2) then you can share one or more of your VCs. You can also share a subset of data from a VC and not the whole thing, or just proof that you have a VC, or a compound proof from multiple&nbsp;VCs.  In seconds, verifiers can verify four things about what you’ve&nbsp;shared:    Who (or what) issued it to&nbsp;you  It was issued to you and not someone&nbsp;else  It hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with  It hasn’t been revoked by the&nbsp;issuer  <p>Voila! Data has just left one trust domain and been accepted into another, without any direct connections between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Most important: verifiers can confirm these four things cryptographically, without having to contact the original issuer. If verifiers had to contact the original issuer to confirm things, that defeats the whole purpose and we’d be back to square one. But they don’t, so we’re not, and that changes everything.</p><p>By using you as the courier of verifiable data between organizations you deal with, unrelated trust domains now have a bridge, and without requiring direct connections to one another. The key to making this all work is that issuers, holders, and verifiers all use the same interoperable protocols. This is why cooperation among competitors and the VC standards work¹ is critical, and exciting that it has made so much progress over the last several&nbsp;years.</p> The Vast Potential of Verifiable Credentials CREDIT: Evernym,&nbsp;Inc.<p>The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains for many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear:</p>  No more usernames or passwords, replaced by trusted&nbsp;VCs  No more forms, quick and easy onboarding everywhere  No more verbal authentication, you’re recognized everywhere you choose to&nbsp;be  Instant, digital, multi-party consent (after waiting for slow humans to decide something)  Instant application approvals  Instant verifications of documents, records  The efficient exchange of any trusted information  <p>The effects for user experience would be wonderful. Friction from trying new vendors, products, and services would reduce to almost nothing. Customers can be instantly recognized as valued guests rather than treated as strangers at each new interaction. Processes and workflows can be simplified, automated, and accelerated, and new, nearly seamless experiences offered.</p> In Conclusion <p>The current inability for data to efficiently traverse trust domains bears a striking resemblance to global trade complexities prior to 1956; Verifiable Credentials bear a striking resemblance to its revolutionary solution, the shipping container.</p><p>Due to the enormous physical, logistical and even political obstacles to adoption, it took shipping containers more than a decade to hit their stride, for everyone to realize their potential. With VCs it will happen much more quickly, as much of our world is already digital, and connected.</p><p>I have often said during my five years in SSI that the tech titans of tomorrow are being created today, and I believe that now more than ever. If there’s a sweet spot for when to jump on the SSI bandwagon, we may still be a tad early, but not much, and I don’t think it will last as long as comparable opportunity sweet spots may have in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>VCs are the shipping containers of our lifetime, with all that&nbsp;entails.</p><p>This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials.

<a href="https://www.atclogistic.net/service/">https://www.atclogistic.net/service/</a> This is part 2 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p> TL;DR:   Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t just functionally similar to shipping containers, they are economically similar as well, and will bring an explosion in global digital trade like shipping containers brought for global physical trade. The right container at the right time can change the world, dramatically.  Shipping containers caused a precipitous drop in shipping costs (over 95%) by bridging the physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks; VCs can deliver a similar cost reduction in the digital realm, by bridging the contexts between organizations.  The transitive trust enabled by VCs enables cooperative network effects, which are even bigger than regular network&nbsp;effects.   If VCs Are Economically Similar to Shipping Containers, It’s a Big&nbsp;Deal <p>The comparison of VCs to shipping containers is much more than a passing one. This analogy, which I’ve been using in presentations and conversations for the last couple of months, has been a big improvement when teaching the basic concept of VCs from a functional standpoint. It is simple, clear, and everyone seems to quickly understand it, a rare breath of messaging fresh air in a world of confusing SSI&nbsp;lingo.</p><p>But more important than messaging clarity, if VCs are economically similar to shipping containers, the ramifications to the digital economy are hard to overstate; everyone in SSI will be in for one heckuva&nbsp;ride.</p><p>In fact, I believe this possibility — that Verifiable Credentials are economically similar to shipping containers — could be the most impactful business realization of my lifetime.</p> The Right Container = Economic Explosion <p>From a humble beginning in 1956, “containerization” brought an explosion in global trade and became “more of a driver of globalisation than all trade agreements in the past 50 years taken together,” according to <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero">The Economist</a>.</p><p>But how?</p><p>Before 1956, when shipping containers were invented by trucking entrepreneur Malcolm McLean, the world already had containers of many kinds — barrels, bags, boxes and crates — that needed to be painstakingly emptied when a ship arrived at port, and contents moved into other containers on trucks and trains. This manual “break-bulk” process, unchanged for millennia, was slow, complicated, dangerous, and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Instead, Mr. McLean envisioned a container that was sturdy, stackable, secure, and most important: moved intact from a truck onto a train or a ship, and then back again when a ship reached its destination, without being re-packed along the way. It took a few years to really take off, but when shipping containers proved their immense usefulness in the Vietnam war it became clear they were the future, and the ISO then introduced the first shipping container standards that the industries of ships, trains, and trucks would begin to adhere&nbsp;to.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is&nbsp;history.</p><p>The efficiency gains were so dramatic that producers of raw materials and small manufacturers in every corner of the world could now market their products to every other corner of the world, changing global trade forever. “Made in China” wouldn’t be a thing today without “containerization.”</p> From $5.86 to&nbsp;$.16 <p>There were many other containers in existence prior to 1956; why did this particular container make such a disproportionate difference?</p><p>“<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Trans-contextual value transfer</a>,” is the answer, in economic terms, my colleague Dr. Sam Smith would use, the ability to efficiently move value between the very different contexts of ships, trucks, and trains. By moving the entire container, and not emptying it until it has reached its final destination, the break-bulk process was eliminated entirely, causing a precipitous drop in shipping times and overall transaction costs. Stunningly, the price to unload one ton of goods fell from <a href="https://traderiskguaranty.com/trgpeak/history-shipping-containers/">$5.86 in 1956 to only $.16&nbsp;today</a>.</p><p>Whenever transaction costs are reduced there is an increase in transactions proportional to the reduction¹, and that is exactly what happened.</p><p>Bridging contexts in any arena is hard, and expensive, but the gains from discovering how to do it efficiently can be enormous. Standardized shipping containers bridged physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks and changed the world forever; VCs will do a similar thing for data, lowering transaction costs by efficiently bridging contexts between trust&nbsp;domains.</p> VCs Do for Data What Shipping Containers Did for Physical&nbsp;Goods <a href="http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/">http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/</a><p>Trust domains and how VCs bridge them, mechanically, is the subject of Part 3 of this series, “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How VCs Bridge Trust Domains</a>,” and so will not be treated fully here, but a quick summary seems appropriate.</p><p>The current process of moving trusted data between unconnected organizations is uncannily similar to the break-bulk shipping process prior to 1956: data must be carefully removed from the data containers of the sending organization and re-packaged into the data containers of the receiving organization. As an example, just ask anyone in the know how academic transcripts in the U.S. are really exchanged between schools today: it is manual, slow, complicated, expensive, and often requires the paid help of 3rd-party intermediaries. Again, this is strikingly similar to break-bulk.</p><p>VCs address this chasm how shipping containers did. Data senders (“issuers”) and data receivers (“verifiers”) first agree on a standardized container². Issuers pack VCs with a desired payload and then issue it, either to the wallet of an individual “holder” or into storage in a database or blockchain. When verified, the verifier can rely on the fidelity of the data payload because they can <a href="https://link.medium.com/Jj8ynRY0e8">verify the provenance and fidelity of the container it came in</a>, and critically, perform that verification cryptographically without contacting the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>We don’t yet know to what degree VCs will reduce costs. Earlier I cited the more than 95% drop in costs shipping containers delivered; that level of efficiency wasn’t fully realized until most ships, trains, and trucks had made modifications to adhere to the standards and were in full production. The same thing will happen with VCs. While it will take some time, with the complete elimination of “break-bulk”-style data exchange, and of the then-obsolete data middlemen and their associated time, cost, and manual processes, the cost reduction will be&nbsp;massive.</p><p>When comparing VCs and shipping containers, you discover the nature of the problem they address is similar, the way they address it is similar, and the size of the markets — global physical trade and global e-commerce — is arguably similar. It follows that the reduction in transactions costs, proportional increase in transactions, and overall economic impact would be similar,&nbsp;too.</p> VCs Unlock Global Network&nbsp;Effects <p>Another, related dimension of the economic impact VCs will have on the digital economy, and one that’s more familiar than shipping containers but potentially just as impactful, is network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>VCs enable a powerful kind of network effect, a cooperative network-of-networks effect. Deeper research into how SSI and VCs enable cooperative network effects has been done by Dr. Samuel Smith, my partner at Digital Trust Ventures, in his seminal paper, <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Meta-Platforms and Cooperative Network-of-Networks Effects</a>, so I will only summarize Sam’s findings&nbsp;here.</p><p>When networks “cooperate,” some value from one network is transferable to another. Cooperative network effects are inter-network and exponentially greater than intra-network effects, like comparing the internet to AOL. To understand cooperative network effects it’s helpful to first understand its cousin: competitive network effects³.</p><p>The ride sharing industry offers an excellent example of competitive network effects. When Uber acquires a new driver, that driver becomes more likely to also drive for Lyft, Uber’s direct competitor. Though Uber and Lyft may wish it were not so, every driver and rider gained by one network is just clicks away from being gained by the other, which is unfortunate for whoever spent large sums to first gain them. This effect accelerates competition, adds price pressure, and sows the seeds of mass defection if it ever becomes advisable. Of course there is a selfishly beneficial tradeoff too, when your network gains from another’s expansion.</p><p>In contrast, cooperative network-of-network effects occur when growth in one network benefits other, non-competitive networks. Literally, customers gained in one network or industry are accretive to other, non-competitive and even completely unrelated networks or industries.</p><p>For example, several credit unions (CUs) in the U.S. are now issuing VCs to members to enable a secure, streamlined experience when they call in, walk in, or log in; they call it <a href="https://www.memberpass.com">MemberPass</a>. While the first use cases are limited to within the issuing CU, any entity in any industry could also choose to accept MemberPass and offer a sleek onboarding and login experience that eliminates forms and passwords for anyone presenting one. What website wouldn’t prefer instant onboarding and authentication of new customers presenting cryptographically verifiable credentials issued by regulated U.S. financial institutions, instead of the friction of forms, usernames, and breachable passwords they’re forced to offer&nbsp;today?</p><p>Every new MemberPass issued becomes a new, easily onboardable prospective customer for any entity anywhere that accepts VCs, online or off. And value flows both ways, as CUs benefit from increased satisfaction whenever members successfully use MemberPass, from increased value provided to members and the loyalty that engenders, and from increased demand for MemberPass from both existing and prospective CU&nbsp;members.</p><p>These are cooperative network effects indeed, as they foster cross-industry collaboration. The only obstacle is awareness.</p><p>This kind of cooperation between unrelated networks, both intentional and unintentional, has rarely been observed or achievable, but with VCs becomes predictable. The resulting ‘meta’ network effects — <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Smith’s Law</a> — are exponential compared to intra-network effects, and also beyond <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29066/metcalfes-law">Metcalfe’s Law</a>. If you’re a student of the science of network effects, be sure to check out <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Sam’s paper</a>. You’re in for a treat; the math for this is incredible.</p> In Conclusion <p>Shipping containers were a once-in-a-lifetime improvement in global trade, forever bridging the physical barriers between ships, trains, and trucks. VCs are the shipping containers of the digital realm, bridging trust domain barriers between organizations, departments, and even internal&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Shipping containers brought an unprecedented multi-decade, multi-trillion-dollar global economic expansion by dramatically reducing transaction costs for physical goods; VCs will do the same for digital goods, and economically change the world to a similar magnitude.</p><p>If that were VCs only economic value, it would be more than enough. VCs also enable cooperative network-of-network effects, where issuances in one industry can benefit other, non-competitive industries, potentially many of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Excited yet?

 This is part 1 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p> TL;DR:   Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t actually credentials, they’re containers, like shipping containers for&nbsp;data.  Having containers inside of containers is a feature, not a&nbsp;bug.  Like physical credentials, the VC container is always verifiable, not its data&nbsp;payload.   The Credential That&nbsp;Isn’t <p>Despite their name, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t really credentials; they are containers, much like shipping containers for data, which actually makes them more useful and powerful than if they were credentials.</p><p>NOTE: The comparison to shipping containers is more than a passing one, as shipping containers are the most impactful containers ever devised and VCs are strikingly similar to them, both functionally and economically. Details of these similarities and their potential ramifications are covered in parts <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">2</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">3</a> of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>Like a shipping container, there’s a sender, called the “issuer”, who packs a VC’s data contents. The receiver of the VC container, called the “verifier”, unpacks and verifies its payload (or a subset proof thereof). Between issuers and verifiers there is typically a human carrying the VC in a standardized SSI digital wallet, but VCs can also be transported in other ways, or stored in a relational database¹ or a distributed ledger².</p><p>The payload of a VC can be any kind of data and is not limited to what might normally be considered a credential.</p><p>In fact, the word “credential” is a holdover from the worlds of identity and academia, where VCs began their standardization journey and have many important use cases. But recently I’ve seen people in academia get confused when the payload inside a VC is what the academic world calls a credential — like a diploma or a transcript — resulting in a credential within a (verifiable) credential. Others get confused when the VC payload isn’t a credential, in either academic or identity parlance, but we still call the VC a credential.</p><p>Now that VCs have the global momentum they do, I feel we need to “open the aperture” beyond identity and credentials. Here are some example VC payloads not typically considered credentials, all of which become cryptographically verifiable when delivered as a payload within a&nbsp;VC:</p>  Consent, permissions, votes,&nbsp;opinions  Balances, totals, deficits, ranges, statistics, source&nbsp;data  Statements, agreements, contracts, invoices, sources  Confirmations, acknowledgements, attestations, assertions, affidavits  The speed, trajectory, weight, temperature or location of&nbsp;anything  Laws, regulations, statutes, rules, orders, decrees, declarations  Photos, videos, music,&nbsp;messages  Software code, hashes, files, the state of a database at a given point in&nbsp;time  Tests, procedures, prescriptions, diagnoses  <p>Of course, objects typically considered credentials make ideal VC payloads:</p>  Identities, names, addresses, usernames, titles, attributes, profiles, bios  Licenses, passports, visas, permits, tickets, coupons, vouchers, receipts  Skills, competencies, certificates, badges, diplomas, degrees, achievements, awards  Identifiers, codes, account numbers, ticket&nbsp;numbers  <p>It is true that the identity- and achievement-related use cases in this second list are those most actively being pursued in the VC space right now, and many in the first list cannot be realized until there’s broader adoption by issuers and verifiers. Still, the word “credential” has a specific meaning in several industries, and it is consistently confusing to VC noobs for one simple reason: it is an inaccurate term for what a VC really is and&nbsp;does.</p><p>Truly, “Verifiable Credentials” should be renamed to “Verifiable Containers.” I can’t think of anything important we lose by doing so, and can think of much clarity and other benefits (detailed in this series) that we would gain. Of all the gnarly terminology challenges we face in the SSI space, this one seems like a slam dunk to&nbsp;me.</p> Containers Inside of Containers Is a Feature, Not a&nbsp;Bug <a href="http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls">http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls</a><p>On several occasions I’ve been asked something like: “We already have containers for learning achievements with <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a>; why do we need another container?”</p><p>A fair question, but it presumes containers inside of containers aren’t useful or necessary for data, which isn’t necessarily the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Life is full of containers inside of containers. Products at the store come in boxes that arrived in larger boxes, stacked with other boxes onto a crate, which itself is another container, often shipped inside shipping containers, which are carried in/on the containers of ships, trains, and trucks. Data is stored inside files within folders, within other folders, inside of directories, inside of virtual machines, inside of partitions, inside a hard drive, within an enclosure, inside a computer, often on a shelf within a rack within a room inside a building.</p><p>You get the&nbsp;point.</p><p>Each level of container has a purpose and adds value and efficiency to the whole chain; try taking one away and it gets messy. Sub-specialties and entire industries are built up around the containers at each level, and they often don’t know much about the containers at the other levels. The people operating giant cranes at a port don’t know or care much about what’s inside the containers they’re moving, and they don’t need&nbsp;to.</p>CREDIT: Cam&nbsp;Geer<p>Even though it is a container itself, like any file a VC must be held in another container: a database, blockchain, or preferably a standardized SSI wallet. If a wallet, that wallet must be held in another container that makes it usable, like a smartphone, a USB stick or even a chipped&nbsp;card.</p><p>A VC can hold any sort of data payload, even as simple as a clear-text “Yes” or “No” when granting or refusing consent. If the payload is more advanced, like an academic achievement, it should be encoded in a way that provides semantic meaning to a verifier, such as an <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/comprehensive-learner-record">IMS Comprehensive Learner Record</a> (CLR). When a CLR is a VC’s payload, it’s an achievement inside of a CLR container inside of a VC container likely inside of a wallet. Take away the CLR container and you lose some semantic meaning for verifiers; take away the VC container and you lose the ability for CLRs to become portable alongside other, non-CLR payloads, forcing CLR users to adopt special capabilities unique to CLRs. If you repeat that specialized thinking for every kind of payload, from academia to healthcare to government, you quickly get back to a world full of bespoke containers and troublesome trust domains, right back where we&nbsp;started.</p><p>This is why a standardized shipping container for data is needed, and just as useful as its physical analog. Whether physical or digital, it’s Russian dolls everywhere you look, and that’s a good&nbsp;thing.</p> VC Containers Are Always Verifiable; Payloads Are&nbsp;Not <p>As with any container, with VCs it’s GIGO: garbage in, garbage out. The only thing that’s always verifiable with a VC is the container itself, where a verifier can cryptographically verify its fidelity, but not always the veracity of the&nbsp;payload.</p><p>For example, ABC University could issue to you a VC with this statement: “blue is green.” Clearly blue is not green and someone was messing around, but we can still verify four elements of the VC’s fidelity:</p>  ABCU issued&nbsp;it;  They issued it to&nbsp;you;  It has/hasn’t been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued;  ABCU has/hasn’t revoked&nbsp;it.  <p>Knowing who packed the container establishes the VC’s provenance to a specific issuer and directly influences a verifier’s willingness to rely on its payload, which is why many conflate this issue and believe that payloads are verifiable. But it is a significant distinction; a verifier can confirm that a VC container is authentic and from a trustworthy source, but still decide not to rely on its payload. (A payload can often be separately verifiable in some way, such as an Open Badge or even another VC, but that is beside the point&nbsp;here.)</p><p>This is how physical credentials work, too. A physical passport is a container that holds data (though only one type of highly regulated data); it is the physical container the airport verifies when you present it to them. Then, upon concluding the container is authentic, the airport usually proceeds to rely upon the data within the presented container. VCs function in the same manner but in the digital realm, and capable of carrying any data payload, which makes them far more flexible, useful, and powerful overall than physical credentials.</p><p>Of course, you don’t need a battery to share your driver’s license, so there’s that. But then again your passport and driver’s license can — and I believe will — become chipped³ and carry VCs just as chipped EMV payment cards carry other bits of data, no batteries required, so there’s that,&nbsp;too.</p> In Conclusion <p>If it’s true that VCs aren’t really credentials, and that calling them credentials often confuses people coming into the space, then we should seriously consider not calling them credentials.</p><p>The fact that VCs are containers capable of carrying any sort of verifiable data payload isn’t just a good thing, it’s a great one. And as you’ll read in parts 2 and <a href="https://medium.com/p/97155d0f3c17/edit">3</a> of this series, it has the potential to change the world as much as the shipping container did, and that’s a big deal. A huge&nbsp;one.</p><p>Finally, it is useful to put other data containers inside of VCs, and maybe even containers inside of those containers, all riding along and benefiting from the portability between trust domains enabled by a Verifiable Credential.</p><p>Or should we say, “Verifiable Container”?</p><p>This article is part 1 of a 3-part&nbsp;series:</p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p><p>¹ Example: BC Gov (British Columbia) Verifiable Organization Network: <a href="https://vonx.io/">https://vonx.io/</a><br>² Examples: <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">https://trust.asu.edu/</a><br>³ German ID cards (“Personalausweis”) are chipped and NFC-accessible through a corresponding app. See <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ausweisapp.bund.de%2Fausweisapp2%2F">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmi.bund.de%2FDE%2Fthemen%2Fmoderne-verwaltung%2Fausweise-und-paesse%2Fonline-ausweisfunktion%2Fonline-ausweisfunktion-node.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Well!  Morgan and I have co-launched a new podcast called
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">FOSS and Crafts</a>!
As the title implies, it's going to be a fairly interdisciplinary
podcast... the title says it all fairly nicely I think: "A podcast
about free software, free culture, and making things together."</p>
<p>We already have the <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">intro episode</a> out!
It's fairly intro-episode'y... meet the hosts, hear about what to expect
from the show, etc etc... but we do talk a bit about some background
of the name!</p>
<p>But more substantial episodes will be out soon.
We have a lot of plans and ideas for the show, and I've got a pretty
good setup for editing/publishing now.
So if that sounds fun, subscribe, and more stuff should be hitting
your ears soon!</p>
<p>(PS: we have a nice little community growing in
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#fossandcrafts on irc.freenode.net</a>
if you're into that kind of thing!)</p>

<p>As the chairman of the board of the OpenID Foundation, he streamlined the process, bolstered the IPR management, and greatly expanded the breadth of the foundation spanning over 10 working groups whose members include large internet services, mobile operators, financial institutions, governments, etc.</p>



<p>He is also active in public policy space. He has been serving in numerous committees in the Japanese government and also advising OECD’s Working Party on Data Governance and Privacy in Digital Economy as a member of the Internet Technical Advisory Committee (OECD/ITAC).</p>

<p>Personally, he was a flautist and still deeply loves (both western and Japanese) ‘classical’ music especially the 20th century and later. (Well, is that ‘classical’?) He spent six years in Kenya while he was in junior and senior high school, where he learnt how to horse ride to go after giraffe, and still loves the life there.</p>

 My latest plugin: datasette-auth-passwords provides a mechanism for signing into Datasette using a username and password (which is verified in order to set a ds_actor authentication cookie). So far it only supports passwords that are hard-coded into Datasette's configuration via environment variables, but I plan to add database-backed user accounts in the future.

<p>I don’t want to explain why we’re bivouac’d at a friend’s house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino,_California">San Marino</a>. What matters, for the purpose of this post, is that we wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But hey, it’s a nice house in a nice town.&nbsp;My only complaint is that there’s nothing resembling an office desk or chair here. I’ve coped by collecting my ass and my electronics within an arrangement of mostly antique furniture. That’s what you see in the screenshot above. (From my <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/586">most recent</a> <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly">Floss Weekly</a> podcast.) The rest of the house looks kinda like the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out">Knives Out</a>.</p>
<p>I start with this setting because a friend asked me to write my own version of what Francine <a href="https://medium.com/@hardaway">@Hardaway</a> published today in <a href="https://medium.com/aging-revealed/releasing-your-former-life-9233e27c603a">Releasing My Former Life</a>. (It’s a good piece. Go read it. I also thank Francine for turning me on to #Clubhouse. It is <a href="https://bluetree.ai/clubhouse-voice-chat-app/">reportedly</a> invite-only and apparently website-less, but I’m hoping she or a reader can get me one. Or two.)</p>
<p>So, what to report?</p>
<p>Well, in pre-pandemic times my wife and I were on the road at least a third of the time, so we’re used to operating out of hotel rooms, conference spaces and seats by the gates of departing flights at airports. So living in places other than home is not odd for us. It is odd to go around wearing masks in public while keeping our distance, as if everyone had just farted; but we hardly go out at all. We provision the kitchen here with runs to Trader Joe’s or Costco on days when they open early for geezers, and that only happens every couple weeks or so. Also, this region isn’t one of those in denial of the pandemic. People here tend to have Fauci-compliant public health practices.</p>
<p>In the early mornings or late evenings, when it’s not 95° outside, I do venture out for walks of 2-3 miles or more in the neighborhood. The roads are wide here, and the pedestrian traffic is light, so I leave the mask off most of the time. There are also lots of amazing trees and gardens, so I’ll pause to admire those and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/docsearls">post occasional photos of interesting stuff on Instagram</a>. (This kind of thing, by the way, comprises almost my entire experience of Instagram.)</p>
<p>While paying work has taken a hit, I remain overcommitted to all the obligations I had before the pandemic arrived, plus a couple new ones, such as the Floss Weekly podcast. It bothers me that I’m not as efficient or as effective in that work as I’d like, but being bothered about it isn’t the same as being depressed or anxious. It just kinda sucks.</p>
<p>Other stuff…</p>
 
 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2011/04/05/dorothy-parker-quote-question/">Dorothy Parker</a>&nbsp;said (or is said to have said) that she preferred the company of younger men “because their stories are shorter.” I am mindful of that. I also know it’s way too easy to talk about infirmities that accumulate, lengthen and get more complicated with age. So I avoid writing, thinking or talking about being old, even though it keeps me up at night, mostly because I have to pee. 
 I’m optimistic about the long-run future, though the short run will surely get worse before it gets better. (Bad things happen when people die at wartime rates and large hunks of the economy are turned off.) I could say more about that, but I won’t, because— 
 There is far more than enough political writing and talk. Sure, I fantasize about speaking up, because I do think I have some useful things to say. I just don’t expect what I say to make a bit of difference. The noise level is so high right now, and the effect level of any given tweet or post is so low, that I’m disinclined to say much. Add that to what I said <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2014/08/03/snow-on-the-water/">here in 2014</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">here two months ago</a>, and you’ll see why I’d mostly rather work on other stuff. 
 
<p>The main thing for me right now is&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>. If it succeeds, it will be the most leveraged thing I’ve ever done, meaning the best for the world. If you’re interested in helping, drop me an email. First name at last name dot com. Thanks.</p>

<p>Sell tickets to attend online through Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, Webex, GoToMeeting, Jitsi or whatever conferencing system can supply working tech to the NBA. Then mic everyone in the paying crowd, project them all on the walls (or sheets hanging from the ceiling), combine their audio, and run it through speakers so players can see and hear the cheering crowds.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_playoffs">playoffs</a> start on July 31. That’s not much time to prepare, but there’s money in it for the NBA and the companies it hires to pull this off. And hey, the Disney folk should be up for doing something that’s this creative and fun. (And think of all the games within games that might also be played here. Also all the other sports where this can also work.)</p>
<p>Since the conferencing systems of the world are already very competitive, sports reporters can cover service selection as the playoff before the playoff.</p>
<p>Obviously <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> is the one to beat (since so many of us already use it), but <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a> just <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/08/reimagining-virtual-collaboration-future-work-learning/">said a bunch of stuff</a>&nbsp;that makes me think they could pull this one off. (I’d also like to thank them for the <a href="https://regarding365.com/5-rules-for-all-company-or-very-large-microsoft-teams-d74153d90c88">imagery</a> I used in the photo above. Also <a href="https://www.downtownmagazinenyc.com/march-madness-is-here-a-look-inside-the-dreamiest-residential-basketball-courts-in-new-york-city/">Downtown</a>. Hope ya’ll don’t mind.) Google has immensity to leverage. Jitsi has a hearty open source dev community. As for the others, here’s your chance to leapfrog the leaders. Or yourselves. The PR will be immense.</p>
<p>What matters is that&nbsp;this can be done. Hell, we’re talking about tech here. Anything can be done with tech.</p>
<p>So let’s do it. Get fans on the walls of <a href="https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=NBA+Bubble">the bubble</a>.</p>
<p>And don’t tell me how it can’t be done. If it can be done with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sing-gently-by-eric-whitacre-creating-a-virtual-choir-with-17572-singers/">17,572 singers in a choir</a>, we can do it with any number of fans.</p>
<p>[Later (24 July)…] This apparently <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-announces-new-in-game-enhancements-including-opportunity-for-fans-to-appear-virtually-in-the-arena/">is being done</a>.</p>

			<p>#BlackLivesMatter #NewYorkCity</p>
		
	

         
<p>I took advantage of the new City Bike dock in front of our flat to ride 80
blocks south through Central Park today to see the new <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/black-lives-matter-painted-on-street-outside-trump-tower.html" title="‘Black Lives Matter’ Painted on Fifth Avenue Outside Trump Tower">#BlackLivesMatter mural</a>
outside Trump Tower. Not too many people around, perhaps a dozen taking photos
and selfies. I joined them, then took a photo for a couple and their toddler in
front of the mural. I couldn’t stop grinning under my mask. The mural may be
symbolic, but holy cats do symbols matter.</p>
<p>More photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCjMEw-ptAg/">on Instagram</a>.</p>

 I am an AI skeptic. I am baffled by anyone who isn’t. 
 
 
 I don’t see any path from continuous improvements to the (admittedly impressive) “machine learning”
field that leads to a general AI any more than I can see a path from continuous improvements in
horse-breeding that leads to an internal combustion engine.

  <p>Published in Locus Magazine. Here are some selective quotes with comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am an AI skeptic. I am baffled by anyone who isn’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t see any path from continuous improvements to the (admittedly impressive) “machine learning”
field that leads to a general AI any more than I can see a path from continuous improvements in
horse-breeding that leads to an internal combustion engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Let me add that everybody I have encountered who is hyping a future AI nirvana has something to sell.
So let’s treat it like the claims of any salesman who sells miracle cures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remediating climate change will involve unimaginably labor-intensive tasks, like relocating
every coastal city in the world kilometers inland, building high-speed rail links to replace
aviation links, caring for hundreds of millions of traumatized, displaced people, and
treating runaway zoontoic and insectborne pandemics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These tasks will absorb more than 100% of any labor freed up by automation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting aside whether we can “remediate climate change” (given where we are, IMHO we can now
at best hope to adapt to it somehow), he’s absolutely correct that whatever we attempt to do,
is going to be immensely labor-intensive. And because it’s
all new and hasn’t been done before, it cannot really be automated, as automation is fundamentlly
about having machines repeat the same thing over and over again. (If you agree with him, as I do,
that a general AI is a looong time away and certainly will not arrive in time to solve this
crisis for us; it should have arrived 30-50 years ago then.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the locus of the problem with technological unemployment: it’s not a technological
problem at all, it’s an economic one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. If technology suddenly took the jobs of gazillions of people, it’s not like there
is nothing that the world needs to get done any more. Look around you: there are tons of
things that should get done, from sweeping the street you live on more often to spending
quality time with foster children or teaching people online the basics of science so they
won’t fall for as many hoaxes.</p>
<p>Our current economic system always has had this very baffling feature of sending people home
to watch TV when the economy tanks, instead of making us all work much harder to get the
economy back out of the hole it is in! It’s the opposite of what should happen!</p>
<p>And as Cory says, the reason why this happens is because private sector employment is correlated
with economic success. Not with the number and size of the problems to be solved.
This is particularly important because many believe, myself included, that any realistic
attempt to deal with the crisis will have to accept some form of economic de-growth, aka
shrinkage. While creating a lot of work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when the pandemic crisis is over, 30% of the world will either be unemployed or working for governments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very possibly so. But unlike what Cory implies, there will also be a significant (30%?
Similar to the unemployment rate?) downturn in income. That’s because if 30% of people don’t work,
or work in jobs for which no business model exists, they don’t produce things that others will
pay for, and so we are all commensurately poorer. Money printing may make this effect less visible
in prices, but as he says, money printing does not produce the things we need or want.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/">full piece</a> published
by Locus Magazine. Unfortunately it also contains a bunch of mistakes, such as about the
consequences of money printing. I have chosen to ignore those because the good points are
really worthwhile and shouldn’t be obscured.</p>

is soo great. In a few cogent, direct, clear paragraphs, she covers her views on
quarantine, Covid, reading, pregnancy, capitalism, Black Lives Matter, policy
changes, protest, climate change, and more. An example, on white discomfort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also suspicious of the way that Not Being Racist is a project that people
seem to be approaching like boot camp. To deepen your understanding of race,
of this country, should make you feel like the world is opening up, like
you’re dissolving into the immensity of history and the present rather than
being more uncomfortably visible to yourself. Reading more Black writers isn’t
like taking medicine. People ought to seek out the genuine pleasure of
decentering themselves, and read fiction and history alongside these popular
anti-racist manuals, and not feel like they need to calibrate their precise
degree of guilt and goodness all the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://websci20.webscience.org/"></a></p>
<p>There is latency to everything. Pain, for example. Nerve impulses from pain sensors travel at about two feet per second. That’s why we wait for the pain when we stub a toe. The crack of a bat on a&nbsp;playing field takes half a second before we hear it in the watching crowd. The sunlight we see on Earth is eight minutes old. Most of this doesn’t matter to us, or if it does we adjust to it.</p>
<p>Likewise with how we adjust to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a>. That law is why the farther away something is, the smaller it looks or the fainter it sounds. How much smaller or fainter is something we intuit more than we calculate. What matters is that we understand the law with our bodies. In fact we understand pretty much everything with our bodies.</p>
<p>All our deepest, most unconscious metaphors start with our bodies. That’s why we&nbsp;grasp,&nbsp;catch, toss around, or&nbsp;throw away&nbsp;an idea. It’s also why nearly all our prepositions pertain to location or movement. Over, under, around, through,&nbsp;with,&nbsp;beside, within, alongside, on, off, above&nbsp;and&nbsp;below only make sense to us because we have experienced them with our bodies.</p>
<p>So::: How are we to make full sense of the Web, or the Internet, where we are hardly embodied at all?</p>
<p>We may say we are&nbsp;on the Web, because we need it to make sense to us as embodied beings. Yet we are only looking at a manifestation of it.</p>
<p>The “it” is the hypertext protocol (http) that Tim Berners-Lee thought up in 1990 so high energy physicists, scattered about the world, could look at documents together. That protocol ran on another one: TCP/IP. Together they were mannered talk among computers about how to show the same document across any connection over any collection of networks between any two end points, regardless of who owned or controlled those networks. In doing so, Tim rubbed a bottle of the world’s disparate networks. Out popped the genie we call the Web, ready to grant boundless wishes that only began with document sharing.</p>
<p>This was a miracle beyond the scale of loaves and fish: one so&nbsp;new and so odd that the movie Blade Runner, which imagined in 1982 that Los Angeles in 2019 would feature floating cars, off-world colonies and human replicants, failed to foresee a future when anyone could meet with anyone else, or&nbsp;any group, anywhere in the world, on wish-granting slabs they could put on their desks, laps, walls or hold in their hands. (Instead Blade Runner imagined there would still be pay phones and computers with vacuum tubes for screens.)</p>
<p>This week I attended&nbsp;<a href="https://websci20.webscience.org/">Web Science 20</a>&nbsp;on my personal slab in California, instead of what was planned originally: in a conference at the University of Southampton in the UK. It was still a conference, but now a virtual one, comprised of many people on many slabs, all over the world, each with no sense of distance any more meaningful than those imposed by the inconvenience of time zones.</p>
<p>Joyce (my wife, who is also the source of much wisdom for which her husband gets the credit) says our experience on the Web is one of absent distance and gravity—and that this experience is still so new to us that we have only begun to make full sense of it as embodied creatures. We’ll adjust, she says, much as astronauts adjust to the absence of gravity; but it will take more time than we’ve had so far. We may become expert at using the likes of Zoom, but that doesn’t mean we operate in full comprehension of the new digital environment we co-occupy.</p>
<p>My own part in WebSci20 was talking with five good people, plus others asking questions in a chat, during the closing panel of the conference. (That’s us, at the top of this post.) The title of our session was&nbsp;The Future of Web Science. To prep for that session I wrote the first draft of what follows: a series of thoughts I hoped to bring up in the session, and some of which I actually did.</p>
<p>The first of thought is the one I just introduced: The Web, like the Net it runs on, is both new and utterly vexing toward understanding in terms we’ve developed for making sense of embodied existence.</p>
<p>Here are some more.</p>
<p>The Web is a whiteboard.</p>
<p>In the beginning we thought of the Web as something of a library, mostly because it was comprised of&nbsp;sites with&nbsp;addresses and&nbsp;pages that were&nbsp;authored,&nbsp;published,&nbsp;syndicated, browsed&nbsp;and&nbsp;read.&nbsp;A&nbsp;universal resource locator, better known as a URL, would lead us through what an operating system calls a&nbsp;path or a&nbsp;directory, much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog">card catalog</a>&nbsp;did before library systems went digital. It also helped that we understood the Web as real estate, with&nbsp;sites and&nbsp;domains that one&nbsp;owned and others could&nbsp;visit.</p>
<p>The metaphor of the Web as a library, though useful, also misdirects our attention and understanding away from its nature as collection of temporary manifestations. Because, for all we attempt to give the Web a sense of permanence, it is evanescent, temporary, ephemeral. We write and publish there as we might on snow, sand or a whiteboard. Even the websites we are said to “own” are in fact only rented. Fail to pay the registrar and off it goes.</p>
<p>The Web is not what’s on it.</p>
<p>It is not Google, or Facebook, dot-anything or dot-anybody. It is the manifestation of documents and other non-stuff we call “content,” presented to us in browsers and whatever else we invent to see and deal with what the hypertext protocol makes possible. Here is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weinberger">David Weinberger</a> and I put it in <a href="http://worldofends.com/">World of Ends</a>, more than seventeen years ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://worldofends.com/#bm1">1.</a>&nbsp;The Internet isn’t complicated<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM2">2.</a>&nbsp;The Internet isn’t a thing. It’s an agreement.<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM3">3.</a>&nbsp;The Internet is stupid.<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM4">4.</a>&nbsp;Adding value to the Internet lowers its value.<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM5">5.</a>&nbsp;All the Internet’s value grows on its edges.<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM6">6.</a>&nbsp;Money moves to the suburbs.<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM7">7.</a>&nbsp;The end of the world? Nah, the world of ends.<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM_8">8.</a>&nbsp;The Internet’s three virtues:<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM8a">a</a>. No one owns it<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM8b">b.</a>&nbsp;Everyone can use it<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM8c">c</a>. Anyone can improve it<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM9">9.</a>&nbsp;If the Internet is so simple, why have so many been so boneheaded about it?<br>
<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM10">10.</a>&nbsp;Some mistakes we can stop making already</p>
<p>That was a follow-up of sorts to&nbsp;<a href="https://cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, which we co-wrote with two other guys four years earlier. We followed up both five years ago with an appendix to&nbsp;Cluetrain called&nbsp;<a href="https://cluetrain.com/newclues/">New Clues</a>. While I doubt we’d say any of that stuff the same ways today, the heart of it beats the same.</p>
<p>The Web is free.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry likes to claim the “free Internet” is a grace of advertising that is “relevant,” “personalized,” “interest-based,” “interactive” and other adjectives that misdirect us away from what those forms of advertising actually do, which is track us like marked animals.</p>
<p>That claim, of course, is bullshit. Here’s what Harry Frankfurt says about that in his canonical work,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit">On Bullshit</a> (Cambridge University Press, 1988): “The realms of advertising and public relations, and the nowadays closely related realm of politics, are replete with instances of bullshit so unmitigated that they can serve among the most indisputable and classic paradigms of the concept.” Boiled down, bullshit is what Wikipedia (at the moment, itsef being evanescent) calls “speech intended to persuade without regard for truth.” Another distinction: “The liar cares about the truth and attempts to hide it; the bullshitter doesn’t care if what they say is true or false, but rather only cares whether their listener is persuaded.”</p>
<p>Consider for a moment&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Win-Bigly-Persuasion-World-Matter/dp/0735219710">Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don’t Matter</a>, a 2017 book by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scott-Adams/e/B000AP9MO0/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1">Scott Adams</a> that explains, among other things, how a certain U.S. tycoon got his ass elected President. The world Scott’s talks about is the Web.</p>
<p>Nothing in the history of invention is more supportive of bullshit than the Web. Nor is anything more supportive of truth-telling, education and damned near everything else one can do in the civilized world. And we’re only beginning to discover and make sense of all those possibilities.</p>
<p>We’re all digital now</p>
<p>Meaning not just physical. This is what’s new, not just to human experience, but to human existence.</p>
<p>Marshall McLuhan calls our technologies, including our media,&nbsp;extensions of our bodily selves. Consider how, when you ride a bike or drive a car, those are&nbsp;my wheels and&nbsp;my brakes. Our senses extend outward to suffuse our tools and other technologies, making them parts of our larger selves. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi">Michael Polanyi</a> called this process&nbsp;indwelling.</p>
<p>Think about how, although we are not really&nbsp;on or&nbsp;through the Web, we do&nbsp;dwell in it when we read, write, speak, watch and perform there. That is what I am doing right now, while I type what I see on a screen in San Marino, California, as a machine, presumably in Cambridge, Massachusetts, records my keystrokes and presents them back to me, and now you are reading it, somewhere else in (or on, or choose your preposition) the world.&nbsp;Dwell may be the best verb for what each of us are doing in the non-here we all co-occupy in this novel (to the physical world) non-place and times.</p>
<p>McLuhan also said media revolutions are&nbsp;formal causes. Meaning that they form us. (He got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes">that one</a> from Aristotle.) In different ways we were formed and re-formed by speech, writing, printing, and radio and television broadcasting.</p>
<p>I submit that we are far more formed by digital technologies, and especially by the Internet and the Web, than by any other prior technical revolution. (A friend calls our current revolution “the biggest thing since oxygenation.”)</p>
<p>But this is hard to see because, as McLuhan puts it, every one of these major revolutions becomes a ground on which everything else dances as figures. But it is essential to recognize that the figures are not the ground. This, I suggest, is the biggest challenge for Web Science.</p>
<p>It’s damned hard to study ground-level formal causes such as digital tech, the Net and the Web. Because what they are technically is not what they do formally. They are rising tides that float all boats, in oblivity to the boats themselves.</p>
<p>I could say more, and I’m sure I will; but I want to get this much out there before the panel.</p>

  <p>GitHub quietly released a new feature at some point in the past few days: profile READMEs. Create a repository with the same name as your GitHub account (in my case that's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonw">github.com/simonw/simonw</a>), add a <code>README.md</code> to it and GitHub will render the contents at the top of your personal profile page - for me that's <a href="https://github.com/simonw">github.com/simonw</a></p>

<p>I couldn't resist re-using the trick <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">from this blog post</a> and implementing a GitHub Action to automatically keep my profile README up-to-date.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/simonw">github.com/simonw</a> and you'll see a three-column README showing my latest GitHub project releases, my latest blog entries and my latest <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TILs</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm doing this with a GitHub Action in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml">build.yml</a>. It's configured to run on every push to the repo, on a schedule at 32 minutes past the hour and on the new <code>workflow_dispatch</code> event which means I get a <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/">manual button I can click</a> to trigger it on demand.</p>

<p>The Action runs a Python script called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/master/build_readme.py">build_readme.py</a> which does the following:</p>

  Hits the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve the latest release for every one of my 300+ repositories  Hits my blog's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/atom/entries/">full entries Atom feed</a> to retrieve the most recent posts (using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/">feedparser</a> Python library)  Hits my TILs website's Datasette API running <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til?sql=select+title%2C+url%2C+created_utc+from+til+order+by+created_utc+desc+limit+5">this SQL query</a> to return the latest TIL links  

<p>It then turns the results from those various sources into a markdown list of links and replaces commented blocks in the README that look like this:</p>

 <code>&lt;!-- recent_releases starts --&gt;
...
&lt;!-- recent_releases ends --&gt;</code> 

<p>The whole script is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/master/build_readme.py">less than 150 lines of Python</a>.</p>

 GitHub GraphQL 

<p>I have a bunch of experience working with GitHub's regular REST APIs, but for this project I decided to go with their newer <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/">GraphQL API</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to show the most recent "releases" for all of my projects. I have over 300 GitHub repositories now, and only a portion of them use the releases feature.</p>

<p>Using REST, I would have to make over 300 API calls to figure out which ones have releases.</p>

<p>With GraphQL, I can do this instead:</p>

 <code>query {
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 100, privacy: PUBLIC) {
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
      nodes {
        name
        releases(last:1) {
          totalCount
          nodes {
            name
            publishedAt
            url
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 

<p>This query returns the most recent release (<code>last:1</code>) for each of the first 100 of my public repositories.</p>

<p>You can paste it into the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/">GitHub GraphQL explorer</a> to run it against your own profile.</p>

<p>There's just one catch: pagination. I have more than 100 repos but their GraphQL can only return 100 nodes at a time.</p>

<p>To paginate, you need to request the <code>endCursor</code> and then pass that as the <code>after:</code> parameter for the next request. I wrote up how to do this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/github/graphql-pagination-python.md">this TIL</a>.</p>

 Next steps 

<p>I'm pretty happy with this as a first attempt at automating my profile. There's something extremely satsifying about having a GitHub profile that self-updates itself using GitHub Actions - it feels appropriate.</p>

<p>There's so much more stuff I could add to this: my tweets, my sidebar blog links, maybe even download statistics from PyPI. I'll see what takes my fancy in the future.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there's a size limit on the README that is displayed on the profile page, so deciding how much information is appropriate is appears to be mainly a case of personal taste.</p>

<p>Building these automated profile pages is pretty easy, so I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of things other nerds come up with!</p>

  <p>This week I've mainly been exploring Small Business Administration Covid-19 loans data, pitching some talks and upgrading some plugins for compatibility with Datasette 0.44+.</p>

 SBA PPP Covid-19 loan data 

<p>On Monday the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1052">released detailed loan-level data</a> for loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program as part of their Covid-19 response.</p>

<p>They released the data as <a href="https://sba.app.box.com/s/wz72fqag1nd99kj3t9xlq49deoop6gzf">a zip file full of CSVs</a> on their Box account (the first time I've seen Box used for this kind of government data release).</p>

<p>The most interesting file in there was <code>foia_150k_plus.csv</code> - a file containing 661,218 loans over $150,000. So I loaded it into Datasette and published it at <a href="https://sba-loans-covid-19.datasettes.com/loans_150k_plus/foia_150k_plus">https://sba-loans-covid-19.datasettes.com/loans_150k_plus/foia_150k_plus</a></p>

<p>I made one modification to the data: on the <a href="https://twitter.com/zeeg/status/1280280556102512640">suggestion of David Cramer</a> I imported a list of NAICS code descriptions <a href="https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/downloadables/downloadables.html">from the US Census</a> and set up the <code>NAICSCode</code> column as a foreign key to that table.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://sba-loans-covid-19.datasettes.com/loans_150k_plus?sql=with+counts+as+%28select+NAICSCode%2C+count%28*%29+as+num_loan_recipients+from+foia_150k_plus+group+by+NAICSCode+order+by+num_loan_recipients+desc%29%0D%0Aselect+counts.NAICSCode%2C+counts.num_loan_recipients%2C+naics_2017.name%2C+%27https%3A%2F%2Fsba-loans-covid-19.datasettes.com%2Floans_150k_plus%2Ffoia_150k_plus%3F_facet%3DCity%26_facet%3DState%26_facet%3DRaceEthnicity%26_facet%3DBusinessType%26_facet%3DGender%26_facet%3DVeteran%26NAICSCode%3D%27+%7C%7C+NAICSCode+as+view_them+from+counts+join+naics_2017+on+counts.NAICSCode+%3D+naics_2017.id">a custom query</a> showing the NAICS codes with the most loan claims &gt; $150k - <a href="https://sba-loans-covid-19.datasettes.com/loans_150k_plus/foia_150k_plus?_facet=City&amp;_facet=State&amp;_facet=RaceEthnicity&amp;_facet=BusinessType&amp;_facet=Gender&amp;_facet=Veteran&amp;NAICSCode=621210">Offices of Dentists</a> come in 8th place with 10,627 loans!</p>

<p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1280283053726691329">Twitter thread</a> has more commentary on things I found exploring the data, and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sba-loans-covid-19-datasette">sba-loans-covid-19-datasette GitHub repo</a> describes the exact steps I went through to create the Datasette instance (using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite">csvs-to-sqlite</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a>).</p>

 Pitching some talks 

<p>I haven't done any public speaking in a while, and the pandemic means I'm not going to be giving any in-person talks for the forseeable future... so I spent some time pitching talks to remote events.</p>

<p>I'll be speaking <a href="https://www.meetup.com/djangolondon/events/271800940/">at Django London</a> on July 14th and I have a few other submissions in the pipeline.</p>

<p>I'm also attending (virtually) the <a href="https://2020.srccon.org/">SRCCON journalism conference</a> next week. They asked me to put together a short video introduction to Datasette, which I've embedded below. I'll be hanging out and talking to anyone who's interested in learning more about the project, or who can help me figure out what direction to take it next.</p>


<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/436903714">SRCCON 2020: Datasette</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user23009240">OpenNews Source</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

 Upgrading plugins 

<p>Datasette 0.44 broke some of my existing plugins due to a change in how it handles ASGI lifespan events. I've upgraded the following this week:</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-configure-fts/releases/tag/1.0">datasette-configure-fts 1.0</a> - a plugin for configuring which columns in a table are enabled for full-text search.  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-tables/releases/tag/0.2a">datasette-edit-tables 0.2a</a> - tools for renaming tables and adding columns. This isn't particularly useful yet but I'm excited about its potential.  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media/releases/tag/0.3">datasette-media 0.3</a> - a plugin for serving media from disk based on paths served out of the SQLite database.  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-search-all/releases/tag/0.3">datasette-search-all 0.3</a> - a plugin providing a mechanism for searching all FTS-enabled tables at once, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Mar/9/datasette-search-all/">discussed here previously</a>.  

 sqlite-utils 2.11 

<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-11">sqlite-utils 2.11</a> is the first release of <code>sqlite-utils</code> that was entirely written by someone else! Thomas Sibley added a new <code>--truncate</code> option for emptying a table (safely within a transaction) before populating it and made an improvement to how transactions work generally.</p>

<p>Thomas inspired me to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/121">start thinking more carefully</a> about how transactions should work with the library.</p>

<p></p><p>Back in April, <a href="https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/1253733189035548672">I tweeted this</a> about how I thought Covid-19 would go down over the next few months:</p><blockquote><p>My working assumptions: we’re not leaving lockdown until the end of August / beginning of September, and there will be a second wave after this, because it’ll still be too early. We’ll see layoffs even at seemingly wealthy companies. Social distancing until at least 2022.</p></blockquote><p>At the time, people were telling me that I should prepare to be in lockdown for maybe another month (so, until two months ago). There had been lots of talk about everything being up and running for Easter (April 12), or for Memorial Day (May 25). My tweet looked like doom-saying pessimism.</p><p>If anything, my assessment now seems overly optimistic. The World Health Organization is now saying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/14/coronavirus-who-warns-it-could-take-up-to-5-years-to-control-pandemic.html">we'll have it under control in 3 to 5 years</a>; Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/dr-anthony-fauci-this-will-end-and-we-will-get-control-over-it#8">we won't have a vaccine until 2021</a> (which in itself <a href="https://codeblue.galencentre.org/2020/05/22/fastest-vaccine-took-five-years-expert-says/">is very fast</a>); almost 40% of healthcare executives think <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19s-impact-wont-end-with-a-vaccine-11593781201">a vaccine won't be made available to all until 2022</a>. Social distancing is likely to be with us for some time to come, and with it, a real change to the way all of us live. This will be true all over the world, but particularly in the United States, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-trump-leading-the-way-americas-coronavirus-failures-exposed-by-record-surge-in-new-infections/2020/06/27/bd15aea2-b7c4-11ea-a8da-693df3d7674a_story.html">where leadership and our own hubris have continued to spectacularly fail us</a>.</p><p>Here in the US, <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/07/07/covid-19-the-numbers/">73% of companies</a> plan to keep at least some workers permanently remote; <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jobless-claims-tell-us-30-million-people-are-unemployed-but-many-doubt-its-that-bad-2020-07-08">30 million people lost their jobs</a> because of the pandemic; at the time of writing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/ending-extra-600-dollar-ui-will-harm-vast-majority-of-unemployed-workers.html">we're in the last week of the $600/week</a> of federal unemployment benefits (unless Congress extends this help). No matter what happens next, the effect of this era will be felt for generations.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is particularly true in communities of color. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html">Indigenous and Black Americans are five times more likely than white Americans</a> to be hospitalized because of the virus. Hispanic or Latinx Americans are four times more likely than white Americans.</p><p>We should have been mentally preparing ourselves for a long pandemic this whole time. Assuming these figures hold, the following is true for the foreseeable:</p><p>We are not going back to the office.</p><p>We are not going to resume the same kind of social activities we're used to.</p><p>We are not going to conferences, or to the movies, or to conventions.</p><p>We are going to need to adapt.</p><p>It's difficult to imagine how we would have coped before the internet. For the last few decades, it's slowly become ingrained in all of our lives. For the last few months, it's become the way all of our lives can operate: famously through Zoom (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/zoom-boom-biggest-airlines/">which is now worth 78X its revenue</a>), but also Slack, Facebook, and all of the apps and services that keep us in touch with each other. All of these services were created long before Covid; it's going to be interesting to see the services people create to cope with the specific challenges of the pandemic. I am hopeful that while some of those services will be startups, others will be open source collectives of people who want to help.</p><p>It's also difficult to imagine how our current systems of care can cope. A pandemic makes clear that we are, as individuals, only as healthy as we are as a society: if lots of people have a deadly, infectious disease, I'm more likely to get it too, no matter what healthcare plan I'm on. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2000821">It's in all of our interests to establish a genuine social care system that allows everyone to be safe and healthy</a> - and in a world where millions of people continue to lose their jobs every month, it's vitally important that this safety net isn't tied to employment. Healthcare must be a human right. Housing must be a human right, with strong tenant protections. Food must be a human right. The fallacy that every single thing needs to be a free market must come to an end.</p><p>We're going through a period of major change, and we're still only on the first foothills. There's a long, hard road ahead. Surviving the next few years will mean covering new ground, and redefining a great deal of how society works.</p><p>Most importantly, we will need to finally learn to work together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@morningbrew?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Morning Brew</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/covid?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>My <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> 2020 talk Enabling Scalable Multi-lateral Federations with OpenID Connect was just broadcast and is <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/Event/ShowKey=96621">available for viewing</a>.  The talk abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Numerous large-scale multi-lateral identity federations are in production use today, primarily in the Research and Education sector.  These include national federations, such as SWAMID in Sweden and InCommon in the US, some with thousands of sites, and inter-federations among dozens of federations, such as eduGAIN.  Yet these existing federations are based on SAML 2 and require the federation operator to poll the participants for their metadata, concatenating it into a huge file that is distributed to all federation participants nightly – a brittle process with significant scalability problems.</p>
<p>Responding to demand from the Research and Education community to migrate from SAML 2 to the simpler OpenID Connect protocol, the OpenID Connect working group has created the OpenID Connect Federation specification to enable this.  The new approach incorporates lessons learned from existing SAML 2 federations – especially using a new, scalable approach to federation metadata, in which organizations host their own signed metadata and federation operators in turn sign statements about the organizations that are participants in the federation.  As Shibboleth author Scott Cantor publicly said at a federation conference, “Given all my experience, if I were to redo the metadata handling today, I would do it along the lines in the OpenID Connect Federation specification”.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe progress implementing and deploying OpenID Connect Federation, upcoming interop events and results, and next steps to complete the specification and foster production deployments.  The resulting feedback from Identiverse participants on the approach will be highly valuable.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a late-breaking addition, data from the June 2020 Federation interop event organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> was included in the presentation.</p>
<p>You can also view the presentation slides as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/Identiverse_2020-Enabling_Scalable_Multi-lateral_Federations_with_OpenID_Connect-Michael_Jones.pptx">PowerPoint</a> or <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/Identiverse_2020-Enabling_Scalable_Multi-lateral_Federations_with_OpenID_Connect-Michael_Jones.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

<p></p><p>As a manager, I believe my primary role is to create the conditions for my team to do their best work. I'm a proponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership">servant leadership</a>. That's become even more important this year, for obvious reasons: we're in the middle of a pandemic that has also had significant economic effects. We're all working remotely (which I've done for over a decade, but is new for this company); we all have <a href="https://werd.io/2020/anxiety-in-2020">significant extra stresses</a> in our lives.</p><p>I've always felt that one of the opportunities for smaller startups is to provide stronger professional development. Whereas other, richer companies can provide eye-watering salaries and kombucha on tap, smaller ventures have the ability to provide more flexibility in support of an employee's personal goals. The result can be a level-up in skills and experience that is far in excess of what might be possible in a more rigid organization of thousands of people. By working at very small startups, I've been able to get my hands dirty working in an interdisciplinary way, and I've developed a mindset of action over discussion; I don't think my career would have been possible without this experience. I want to provide that to the people who I support.</p><p>There's no great manual for this, although I consider myself to always be learning. Here are some things I've found useful, which I'm putting out as a request for feedback as much as anything else. I'd love to learn what other managers have found useful, and I'd love for thoughts on the techniques I've been using.</p><p>I'm a happy user of <a href="https://range.co/">Range</a>, which helps us plan our days, check in with each other, and understand each other a little bit better. We've found that it also helps to have live standups every day, and we have <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings">a tactical meeting</a> every week, but the Range updates are a low-friction, high-empathy way to keep everyone on the same page about the work going on.</p><p>The 1:1 has become the most important way for me to support each member of the team. I make sure that I spend time with every engineer on my team; the space is theirs to bring up anything that's important to them, and I've often found myself helping with external factors that might also be affecting their work. I want to support the whole human, and it's often stretched me as a person.</p><p>How you show up in this framework is incredibly important. As a servant leader, it's much more about being a coach than, for example, being a teacher or a micromanager. This year, I found <a href="https://www.edbatista.com/">Ed Batista's</a> course <a href="https://www.edbatista.com/the-art-of-self-coaching-public-course.html">The Art of Self-Coaching</a> to be really useful; normally it's a part of Stanford's MBA program, but a version was made available to all because of the pandemic. It's helped me formalize some thoughts around <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth vs fixed mindsets</a> in particular, as well as be more self-aware about how my own thoughts and feelings affect my team and my work.</p><p>They own the agenda. I always start a 1:1 by asking what's top of mind for them. Sometimes, the resulting discussion can take up the whole meeting; occasionally it'll overflow into follow-ons. I'll sometimes prod with questions like "what are you excited about?" and "what are you worried about?", which will reveal topics that hadn't readily risen to the surface.</p><p>A while back, I asked everyone to work on a professional development plan. I've seen a lot of development plans that are just about identifying what someone wants to learn, or how someone can improve, without really touching on the "why" of it. Particularly for younger engineers, that might not be something they've thought too deeply about, so I wanted to create a better framework for figuring that out.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OsOnZc4zA30uhvKntOYlrrU2idRpR-cVKXlfe07LMXo/edit?usp=sharing">Here's a lightly redacted version of the template I came up with</a>. If it's helpful to you, please feel free to adapt and use it (I'm also very interested in feedback). It asks the owner to think about what their mission at their work is - what do they want to achieve over the course of their career? It specifically offers my own mission, as well as another sample mission, as examples. Following this, it asks about their goals - where do they want to be a few years from now? Again, I offer examples, including for myself. And finally, it asks what the tactical next steps are towards getting there. (This is analogous to the <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/wholefarm/html/c5-09.html">mission, vision and strategy</a> of a company.)</p><p>That mission and vision might not involve working at the company forever; the colleague might want to found a startup, for example. That's completely okay. The answers to each of these things might not come readily; that's an opportunity for us to work together to figure it out. But once we have some of those answers, particularly to the tactical next steps, I make sure to refer to them during every 1:1. Are we making progress towards these goals together? What else can I do to help?</p><p>Finally, I'll sometimes use <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/feedback-is-a-gift-df8fbf599b69">a feedback exercise I learned at Matter</a>. This is something that's been harder to reproduce while we've all been remote; I'm planning on building a lightweight web tool to support it. But in person, I've found it to be very useful in a variety of situations. The jist is: on 6 Post-Its, you provide feedback for yourself (3 supportive items, 2 things you'd change, and 1 item that reflects how you're feeling about your work), and then you do the same for the other person. Then you provide that feedback for the other person, who has also provided feedback for themselves and for you. Because everyone is being vulnerable and taking care to be mindful of how they express themselves, the exercise results in a kind of radical honesty that's usually hard to achieve at work. It has the power to clear the air, identify opportunities for real growth, and find wins that you might not realize existed. I love it.</p><p>You may have noticed that despite being a product and engineering leader, almost none of this is directly to do with product and engineering. I've certainly got opinions on how to, for example, run brainstorms and retros; I've also got opinions on how to think about building software. We often talk about those things in these conversations. But the core of being a manager is about supporting the people you work with. That's more about the touchy-feely human stuff than anything else.</p><p>If you have resources, ideas, or feedback on any of the above, I'd love to hear them. I'm always learning, and I could always do better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jaysung?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jehyun Sung</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/leadership?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

  Do you serve a problem or do you solve a problem?<br><br>Serving problems is lucrative work.<br><br>Solving problems is valuable work.<br><br>Extracting the value from your service of problems is done in completely different ways than from solving problems. People who solve problems are the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the social-benefactors that move our species forward. People who serve problems benefit from the existence of problems to serve.<br><br>This is a profoundly important distinction to understand in the constitution of any Society. People do the work they are enticed to do. Work is valued in any number of ways, and markets form systems based on the repeatability of a task, or behavior, or contract model.<br><br>Contracts define the repeatability of actions. Solving problems ends the service loop provided by those people that benefit from the existence of problems to serve. All around the industrialized world, people are serving problems. Little problems that are solved with button pushes, and big problems that require emotional investment.. both are being solved by people. Solving those problems in a different manner than they are being served creates a new problem:<br><br>What will people who serve problems do if someone solves the problem that they serve?<br><br>The extinction of problems is a HUGE problem for people that are dependent on the existence of problems to serve for their own well-being. Do you see the loop? Do you sense the problem?<br><br>Meta-thinkers that can escape this loop and apply their attention to the solving of problems are the greatest agents of change possible in the Human species. All over the world, the fear of the future is taking over immature psychologies. People who fear their own ability to take care of their needs, to have enough to get by, or to prosper with adequate health, wealth and wisdom through life's required challenges, are falling victim to a very predictable mental deficiency.<br><br>The unpredictability of life is not unique, it is the status quo. Change is constant, and people are here to solve the problems that life is composed of. Serving problems is an industrial era monetization of the permanence of problems. Government think tanks of eras gone by persist this logic pattern and operational mandate in order to extract rent from the existence of problems they, and their cronies, service.<br><br>Service models that help problems persist exist definitively in 2020 as political platforms. Creating problems from the raw material of modern life, recycling problems that are rehashed from dead history, joining problems in endless propaganda cycles that induce fear, compliance, and predictable work-patterns is how problem-servers maintain their authority in Society.<br><br>People are manipulated into believing, into accepting the idea that the servants of persistent problems, and problem-cycles that never end, are here to help them. People buy into these ideas in good faith, because they think that these "good people" serving their problems are their friends helping them overcome, when in fact they are the barnacles riding shotgun on the energy of the problem that is being served for the benefit of the party being directly affected by the problem, as well as the party earning a paycheck via their service of the problem.<br><br>Never-ending cycles of oppression are the result when the servants of problems show up on the scene. In the name of social justice, of workers rights, or child welfare, of education, of health care, of drug enforcement, and many other problems, servants of problems loot the world of value in a never-ending cycle of servitude. Problems persist indefinitely, incremental improvements ebb and flow, and people believe in servants that become parties with platforms.. servants of problems.. VOTE DEMOCRAT!<br><br>Problem solvers are different.<br><br>Problem solvers are disruptors.<br><br>Problem solvers end service cycles, and give new capabilities to Individual people. ALWAYS to Individual people, empowerment solutions are delivered directly to the experience where people have problems. This is the critical distinction, as Individuals we begin, as Individuals we remain.. for our entire life, one person will travel with you for the duration. One.<br><br>One among many other ones, this is our species Humanity.<br><br>Solving human problems is the highest order work there is. People solving problems is as close as we will ever come to the purpose of human life. People helping people solve problems, everyday.. constantly, new problems is the raw material of enlightenment, and equality for enlightened people.<br><br>There is no other condition that intercedes as more important than being human, and solving problems.<br><br>Mob rulers need mob thinkers, to enforce their service model to problems. People will never solve a problem so long as they are held captive to the servants of problems. When you vote, vote not for the servants of Society's problems, but for the people that solve problems.<br><br>Vote for the actual, functional leader. Vote for your operational existence, vote for the solution to real problems, and look for the distinction between problems that can be solved, and problems that exist so that they can be serviced.<br><br>This will help you immensely in your life, and it will solve a major problem for all of Humanity.<br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Last week I suddenly felt horrendous: I felt deeper fatigue than I had in years, I was experiencing severe headaches, and I was finding it hard to think straight. My daily work has become a series of Zoom meetings, and I careened from scheduled event to scheduled event, hoping I could just get through it.<br><br>Of course, this being 2020, I began to worry about Covid-19. I spend most of my time right now around my immunosuppressed mother, who is not doing well completely independently of the pandemic, and I'm deeply worried that I'll somehow transmit something to her. I'm a little bit worried about the virus for myself, too, but to be honest, I have no idea what my life looks like beyond all this - not just beyond the pandemic, but also beyond my family's health journey.<br><br>I don't have Covid; I just came dangerously close to burning out.<br><br>Lately, I've learned that too many stimuli lead to my feeling physically wrecked. It's not just that the notifications, messages, and tiny dopamine hits make me feel mentally overwhelmed, but they start to push me to the right of the bell curve of physical anxiety symptoms. I need to rate-limit and sanitize my inputs, otherwise my outputs suffer.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law"></a><br><br>At this point, my social media hiatus from Thanksgiving through to New Year's Day has become a tradition. I always feel better. It's got very little to do with the actual content of social media - although endless outrage is inevitably wearing, it's not like any of the outrage is actually misplaced - and more to do with the physical mechanisms of the software itself. The interaction mechanics that keep us coming back for more, designed to juice the engagement statistics, undeniably increase my anxiety - if only just a little.<br><br>Which I think would be fine if it wasn't 2020. We're in the middle of a global, deadly pandemic. My mother is dying. My father is getting older. My sister has become long-term disabled with chronic pain. I have a demanding job (which, to be clear, I love). The President of the United States continues to show his true colors as a racist and a fascist. And the blowback from the world's largest civil rights movement - a point of hope in itself - is staggering, even within my own extended family. Finally, there was an event in my extended family this week that I don't even begin to want to talk about here.<br><br>Given all this, the baseline of stress is much further to the right of the anxiety bell curve, which means that stimuli which would ordinarily be tolerable are less so. Again, it's not so much about the content of the stimuli: I've even discovered that playing Stardew Valley, a lovely little computer game about running a farm, has been sometimes too much.<br><br>I'd like to remain functional, be able to show up well at work, and support my family and friends in the way I would like. So that means cutting out stimuli.<br><br>Rather than cutting things out wholesale, I'm going to aim for moderation, at least to start. I like that Screen Time has made its way to MacOS from the iOS / iPadOS devices. Because my screen time goals sync between them, I can allocate myself 30 minutes a day for game playing, for example, and 45 minutes for social media. (Because RSS feeds and blogging are not rapid-fire, I don't feel the need to ration them.) I've also made a concerted effort to bring down my Zoom meeting load by around a third, giving me more contemplative time at work.<br><br><br>I recognize that talking about burnout and cognitive stamina isn't really the done thing - I think I'm supposed to be hustling? Shouldn't I be building a personal brand based on excellence and productivity? But that's exactly why I'm talking about it here. We all need to look after ourselves and each other, now more than ever. I spend a lot of my time caring for others, and it can be easy to forget self-care. But the old adage of needing to put your own oxygen mask on first is true. I need to do better at remembering that, and maybe you do too.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit"></a><a href="https://weelookang.blogspot.com/2012/01/gravity-physics-by-inquiry-2012-innergy.html"></a></p>
<p>To answer the question <a href="https://www.quora.com/Where-are-SiriusXM-radio-stations-broadcasted-from">Where are SiriusXM radio stations broadcasted from?</a>, I replied,</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re wondering where they transmit from, it’s a mix.</p>
<p>SiriusXM transmits primarily from a number of satellites placed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit">geostationary orbit</a>, 35,786 kilometres or 22,236 miles above the equator. From Earth they appear to be stationary. Two of the XM satellites, for example, are at 82° and 115° West. That’s roughly aligned with Cincinnati and Las Vegas, though the satellites are actually directly above points along the equator in the Pacific Ocean. To appear stationary in the sky, they must travel in orbit around the Earth at speeds that look like this:</p>
 
 3.07 kilometres or 1.91 miles per second 
 110,52 kilometres or 6,876 miles per hour 
 265,248 kilometres or 165,025 miles per day 
 
<p>Earlier Sirius satellites flew long elliptical geosynchronous orbits on the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_orbit">tundra</a>“ model, taking turns diving low across North America and out into space again.</p>
<p>Satellites are also supplemented by ground repeaters. If you are in or near a site with repeaters, your Sirius or XM radio may be tuned to either or both a transmitter in space or one on the ground nearby. See <a href="http://www.dogstarradio.com/sirius_map.php">DogstarRadio.com’s Satellite and Repeater Map</a> to see if there is one near you.</p>
<p>In addition, SiriusXM also streams over the Internet. You can subscribe to radio, streaming or both.</p>
<p>As for studios, those are in central corporate locations; but these days, thanks to COVID-19, many shows are produced at hosts’ homes. Such is the case, for example, with SiriusXM’s popular <a href="https://www.howardstern.com/">Howard Stern</a> show.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, you might say SiriusXM’s channels and shows are broadcast from everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should add that I’ve been a <a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/">SiriusXM</a> subscriber almost from the start (with Sirius), and have owned two Sirius radios. The last one I used only once, in August of 2017, when my son and I drove a rental minivan from Santa Barbara to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157685178733601">Love Ranch</a> in central Wyoming, where we watched the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157685565717863">solar eclipse</a>. After that it went into a box. I still listen a lot to SiriusXM, almost entirely on the phone app. The rest of my listening is over the Web, logged in through a browser.</p>
<p>Item: a few days ago I discovered that a large bill from SiriusXM was due to a subscription for both the radio and the Internet stream. So I called in and canceled the radio. The subscription got a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I think SiriusXM is a single example of a transition going on within the infrastructure of what we still call radio, but instead we would call streaming if we started from scratch today. We would call it streaming because&nbsp;that’s how broadcasting looks like on the Internet. And the Internet is subsuming and gradually replacing over-the-air radio with what for most purposes is a better system. When it’s done, most or all of over-the-air radio will be gone.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a> (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012), I saw this future for what we wouldn’t call television if we started that one from scratch today (or even when this was published, eight years ago):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527"></a></p>
<p>Today we’d put Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube TV and Apple TV in the upper left (along with legacy premium cable staples, such as HBO and Showtime). We’d put PBS stations there too, since those became subscription services after the digital transition in 2008 and subsequent spectrum sales, which reduced over-the-air TV to a way for stations to maintain their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Must-carry">must-carry</a> status on cable systems. (Multiple “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_reallocation#Repacking">repacks</a>” of TV stations on new non-auctioned channels have required frequent “re-scans” of signals on TVs of people who still want to watch TV the old-fashioned way and hook up an antenna.)</p>
<p>While over-the-air radio has been terminal for years, its death has been less hastened by regulatory changes to satisfy the need for more data-friendly frequencies (which TV has, and radio doesn’t). <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/01/05/the-slow-sidelining-of-over-the-air-radio/">Here’s the diagnosis I published in 2016</a>. I’ve also been keeping a photographic chronicle of radio in hospice, over on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">Flickr account for Infrastructure</a>. A touching example of one station’s demise is <a href="https://www.abandonedamerica.us/wfbr-radio">Abandoned America’s post&nbsp;on the forgotten but (then) still extant studios</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJZ_(AM)#WFBR_(1924%E2%80%931990)">WFBR (1924-1990)</a> in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The main difference with radio is that it still wants to be free.</p>
<p>Want to have some fun with that? Go to <a href="http://radio.garden/search">RadioGarden</a> and look around the globe at free streams from everywhere. My own current fave is little <a href="https://cjucfm.com/">CJUC</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehorse,_Yukon">Whitehorse</a>, Yukon. (I list others&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/04/18/digging-in-radio-garden/">here</a>.) All of those are what we say is “on” the Internet. But where is that?</p>
<p>We can pinpoint sources in the physical world, as RadioGarden does, on a globe; but the Internet defies prepositions, because there is no “there” there. There is only here, where we are now, in this non-place with no distance and no gravity because its nature is to defy both, leaving those up to the individual. I’m in Santa Barbara right now, but could be anywhere. So could you.</p>
<p>On the Internet, over-the-air TV and radio are anachronisms, though charming ones. Like right now, as I’m listening to&nbsp;Capricorn FM from Polokwane, South Africa. (“Crazy up-tempo hip-hop” is the fare.) But I’m not listening on a radio, which would require tuning to 89.9fm somewhere within range of the station’s transmitter. I’m&nbsp;here, on (or in, or through, or pick-your-preposition) the Internet.</p>
<p>A few years ago my then-15-year-old son asked me what the point of “range” and “coverage” was for radio stations. Why, he wondered, were those features rather than bugs? Meaning why is it okay for a station to fade away as you drive out of town?</p>
<p>His frame of reference, of course, was the Internet. Not the terrestrial world where distance and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a> apply.</p>
<p>Of course, we will always live in the terrestrial world. The Internet may go away, or get <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/four-internets-geopolitics-digital-governance">fractured into regions</a> so telecom companies can bill for crossing borders and governments can limit what’s accessible within those borders. But the Internet is also an infrastructural genie that is not going back in the bottle. And it is granting many wishes, all in a new&nbsp;here. It exists in the manner of a natural law, such as we have with gravity in the physical world.</p>
<p>And I submit that we are still only starting to understand it. (For&nbsp;how we’re only starting,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/what-does-the-internet-make-of-us-118421ac5e">see here</a>.)</p>

<p>去る7月1日に次のような記事が流れてきました。</p>



<a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/enterprise/articles/2007/01/news062.html?bpc=93b2579766e17e5f0383ca6e14b267441c866c19c93385b8da1cf42098d5b19e"></a>



<p>ただ、この記事からだけだと、結局どういう脆弱性なのかわかりませんし、Palo Alto Networks のサイトの<a href="https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2021">当該ページ</a>に行っても同様です。ここのところ忙しくてなかなか手が回らなかったのですが、今日土曜日は仕事をしないと決めていたのでちょっと調べてみました。といっても、他の文献をあたっただけですが。</p>



<p>その中で詳しくて良いと思ったのが、<a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-2021-palo-alto-networks-pan-os-vulnerable-to-critical-authentication-bypass">tenable</a>の解説です。</p>



 攻撃成功の前提条件 



<p>それによると、この攻撃が成功するためには次の２つの前提条件があります。</p>



  SAML認証をおこなっていること。  IdPの証明書の検証を行わない設定になっていること。

<p>「IdPの証明書の検証を行わないなってことあるの？」と思われるかも知れませんが、これはかなり普通のことです。自己署名証明書を使う場合がこれで、いわばRaw Keyを使っている状態ということになります。上記の記事によると、実際に以下の製品ではこの設定を推奨しているようです。</p>

<p>メジャーどころ勢揃いですね。そして、セキュリティ的にはこれで問題ありません。</p>



 何が起きているのか？ 



<p>さて、では、お待ちかねのセキュリティホールの内容です。(図１)の設定で省略されるのは、IdPが署名に使う証明書のCertificate ChainとRevocationのチェックを省略するだけのはずですよね？ところが、実際には、SAML Assertionに対するIdPの署名の検証まで省略してしまっていたようなのです。すべてのSAML Assertionへの署名の検証が省略されるのか、ある特定の条件のときなのかはわかりませんが、その条件にあたれば、管理者の権限まで取られてしまうことは確かなようです。なので、重大性MAXの脆弱性〜VPNで守っているつもりでもまったく守られていない状態〜にあたるわけですね。</p>



<p>ITメディアの記事を最初に読んだときには「署名検証の不備」と書かれていたので、またXML署名におけるXML正規化由来の署名バイパスかと思って、</p>



 
<blockquote><p>XMLDSig の署名検証は人類には早すぎた。＞ Palo Alto Networks製品のSAML認証に危険度最大の脆弱性、米サイバー軍も注意喚起 <a href="https://t.co/1usvMmpwOX">https://t.co/1usvMmpwOX</a></p>— 崎村夏彦 (=nat) (@_nat) <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat/status/1278750585026576385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
 



<p>と書いたのですが、どうやらそうではなくて、「PKIは人類には早すぎた」問題だったようです。</p>



 対策 



<p>対策は２種類あります。</p>



  PaloAltoネットワークが出したパッチを当てる。  すぐにパッチが当てられないならば、IdPの使う証明書を自己署名ではなくCAが発行したものに変え、IdPの証明書の検証を行うようにすること。  



<p>です。まだ、実際の攻撃はされていないようですが、可及的速やかに対策する必要がありますのでご注意ください。</p>

  In 2008, my new family had a 3 year old child, a young international toy design and distribution company, and a newly emerging indie educational technology non-profit to take care of and grow with all the daily intensities you can imagine. Money? Yeah, we were working our butts off to survive and prosper with ideas and implementations that had very little support to fall back on if something went wrong. Health care? Yeah, we paid for it ourselves.<br><br>Then came ObamaCare. You might of heard about it. I watched the news, wondering if our Government would do something right for a change. Then reality started to sink in. The "Individual Mandate" was a perversion of the system I knew, and was an ugly administrative overreach that looked desperate in its attempt to force participation. Every part of that program was devised to support the non-working class, or the employed-class of people. As an entrepreneur funding my own survival, and any hope of quality of care or prosperity, I was not a consideration. Months later, after its passage, this reality become solidified. My family lost the health care it was paying for independently.<br><br>I was a casualty of progress, right? A method of socialized health care was being promoted as a savior for the people of my country, when in fact, it was being experienced in just the opposite way by an actual American family. It took me many years to solve this problem, but eventually I did so. It is called DevCare... and I provide it to 9 people who work for me plus their families. I spend $60,000+ per year providing health care to the people I employ. It works, and it works really well.<br><br>ObamaCare? Yeah.. that was pure socialist BS. That was never a solution to a problem, it was a redesign of dependency, forced upon Americans by a President and Congress hell-bent on changing America from a place where an "American Dream" of self-possession, private ownership, free-enterprise and hard work paid off. Instead, we all got equalized.. as Medicare dependents.<br><br>So along the way, after years doing private toy development, and licensing under brands as well known as "Imaginarium" from Toys R Us, we folded shop. It was time to move on. Doing business in China was not going to go well for anyone anymore. The writing was on the wall. "Move along"....<br><br>My kid, in the meantime, had entered the public school system, specifically because I wanted him to have an experience of learning with the public in my country. We lived in an extremely rural location, and 60%+ of the students attending our school received federally subsidized lunches. So in order to make sure the school produced at the level I hoped, my wife and I volunteered. She became the President of the PTA, and I donated my time and resources to introduce kids to robotics, programming, and art/math/logic that can move while you learn about it. Along the way, some local-yocal parents complained that our activities were going to steal jobs from the local contractor-economy, and should be shut-down. I shit you not. The school Principal was smarter than that, and we continued volunteering.. at least until 2nd grade.<br><br>That was the end of my public school experience. In 2nd grade, we exceeded the capacity of the public school system in the United States of America. There was no other choice... move, pay for private school that "might" be better, or do it yourself... home school... or leave the religious stuff out and just "indie school". So we did so... we built a company that supports multiple families while educating our own child indie school style.<br><br>And we moved... to New York.. to Long Island, where accessing independent learning was much easier than in Virginia. Where economics was something that had velocity, and all sectors were present in everyday life... not separated by scores of miles, stored on Dulles Toll Road, or in communities trying to overcome their racist past like Charlottesville.<br><br>And along the way, we had an experience that was completely unexpected; others saw the world and the problems being created at the hands of socialist Governors as we did. Individual mandates were seen as communist over-reaches, regardless of media propaganda controlling the masses of dependents. And being an entrepreneur, building and teaching, and leading the world towards "functional literacy" and "functional identity" by sourcing everyone with the ideas behind self-Sovereign identity, starting in President Obama's own $10million effort called NSTC, started picking up steam.<br><br>But socialists do one thing well... they clone value so they can deplete it. They loot, to be more precise. And by becoming visible, and sharing problem:solution outcomes, I was exposing myself to a ravenous community of socialist looters, both in Washington DC and Silicon Valley. No one survives that onslaught, right? With a social graph documenting all the relationships and hidden beliefs of Americans, and Government making dependency the law of the land, producing functional literacy on the part of American's was becoming increasingly challenging.<br><br>"If you are not a socialist in your 20's, you have no heart. If you are not a capitalist by your 30's, you have no brain".. not sure that is an actual quote anybody ever said, but it makes sense in observable reality.<br><br>I was raised by a Teacher, a social worker who believed she could solve the worlds problems by caring enough, even if practicable financial literacy was a mystery concept. I come from a family of educators, economists, a learned people.. and I respect all their ideas and practices to help the world be a better place, and people be better citizens.<br><br>But I am not one to swallow conformity, and I am not one to wait for my dependencies to be served by a Governing system that can not accurately define them, let along respect the life, liberty or pursuit of happiness that Individuals create in my country.<br><br>So with all the "Hope" in the world for "Change I could Believe in" I decided to go a different route. I decided to solve my own problems. To stand up my own Rights. To demonstrate what a functional American is, and to mentor others to overcome the false education system based on "Credentials of Exclusion" that exists to provide employment first, and education next. Jobs, Jobs Jobs!<br><br>Sure, a "Union of Workers" seems like a decent concept within a "More Perfect Union".. but is it? The USSR (Russia) was formed for just that purpose...&nbsp; a "Union of Workers". More importantly, how is a "More Perfect Union" made possible by sub-Unions, or operational cults in most cases, that demand loyalty from their participants and black-ball any and all non-believers who step out of line?<br><br>America in 2020 has a thinking problem to overcome. It has induced an operational problem wherein data slaves functioning on a data plantation believe they are "FREE", when in fact they are anything but. Labor is owned by the State, Identity is provisioned by the State, and compliance is not optional.<br><br>Is that even Constitutionally accurate? No, but then again, the Constitution does not compute in 2020. How can it ever hope to be accurate in rendering the operational format of participation for citizens when it can not even be designed effectively at root participation for American babies with any sense of accuracy? American babies with a Social Security number, after all, are the most at risk population for identity theft that there is. Sound like a good system?<br><br>Depends who you ask.<br><br>You see, the Government loves stability. Nothing propels a war machine like the stable revenue derived from employees. W2/W4 employees after all, pay the Government first, before they ever receive any money in their pay checks, having it auto-debited from their salaries. Of course, owners do it completely different, having a system designed to support them because well.. "Ownership Supremacy" on planet Earth is easily experienced. Owners pay the Government last, after all expenses have been deducted against revenue.<br><br>A Society of Owners is the only structural equality that will ever be possible. In 2020, the concept of "White Supremacy" dominates the perception of operationally illiterate people. In our country, a socio-economic war was fought, and owners were the winners on both sides of the transition from enslavement to employment, because structure yields results. It was never about black/white... it has always been about the ownership contract. Native Americans did not experience genocide, they experienced the incremental defeat of living on a planet that you do not own. Owners own the world that everyone else is living on.<br><br>Equality begins when you own yourself, and you own root participation in civil Society. That begins at identity formation. American Sovereignty was demonstrated by the founding fathers. They had no permission to dissolve their Sovereign allegiance to the King of England, and they did not have any permission to "Declare Independence" as a Sovereign Nation. But these people understood something far more basic and true. Human authority on planet Earth, and in this Universe, is self-Sovereign, or it does not exist. You may need to fight for your Human Rights, but they will never come from anyone but yourself.<br><br>No Institution, no man-made organization will ever give Humanity the direct experience that the Creator of existence has given to Humanity. Self-Sovereign Human Authority is the only authority that exists in Civil Society, or your Society is not civil.<br><br>Look around 2020 people... your Society is not civil. Fixing that starts with identity, for owners.<br><br>Own Root. It is not optional.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <p>Datasette 0.45, out today, features magic parameters for canned queries, a log out feature, improved plugin documentation and four new plugin hooks.</p>

<p>As I did <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">for Datasette 0.44</a>, I'm going to provide an annotated version of <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-45">the full release notes</a> here on my blog.</p>

 Magic parameters for canned queries 

<blockquote><p>Canned queries now support <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries-magic-parameters">Magic parameters</a>, which can be used to insert or select automatically generated values. For example:</p>
 <code>insert into logs
  (user_id, timestamp)
values
  (:_actor_id, :_now_datetime_utc)
</code> 
<p>This inserts the currently authenticated actor ID and the current datetime. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/842">#842</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a fun new feature that extends the capabilities of <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#writable-canned-queries">writable canned queries</a>, introduced in Datasette 0.44.</p>

<p>The key idea here is to make it easy to insert contextual information such as the current timestamp, the authenticated actor or other automatically generated values as part of a writable query.</p>

<p>This means Datasette's canned queries are now powerful enough to build things like simple comment systems or logging endpoints purely by defining a SQL query with the right magic parameters.</p>

<p>There's even a <code>:_random_chars_32</code> parameter that automatically generates a random text string - useful for things like generating authentication tokens for use with <code>datasette-auth-tokens</code>. More on this below.</p>

 Log out 

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#authentication-ds-actor">ds_actor cookie</a> can be used by plugins (or by Datasette's <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#authentication-root">--root mechanism</a>) to authenticate users. The new <code>/-/logout</code> page provides a way to clear that cookie.</p><p>A "Log out" button now shows in the global navigation provided the user is authenticated using the <code>ds_actor</code> cookie. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/840">#840</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Out of the box, Datasette's authentication system is quite primitive: the only way to get an authenticated session is to use the <code>--root</code> option to get a special link when the server first starts running. As <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#the-ds-actor-cookie">described in the documentation</a>, the goal is for plugins to fill in the rest.</p>

<p>Even with just that mechanism it still makes sense to let people log out again! The new <code>/-/logout</code> page can do that, and Datasette's navigation now includes a log out button if the user is logged in using that <code>ds_actor</code> cookie.</p>

<p>You can see what this looks like <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/-/patterns">in Datasette's pattern portfolio</a>.</p>

 New plugin hooks 

<blockquote><p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-register-magic-parameters">register_magic_parameters(datasette)</a> can be used to define new types of magic canned query parameters.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm increasingly trying to have Datasette internally use plugin hooks for default behaviour. This hook can define custom magic parameters - you can see the implementation of the default parameters using this hook in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.45/datasette/default_magic_parameters.py">default_magic_parameters.py</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-startup">startup(datasette)</a> can run custom code when Datasette first starts up. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-init">datasette-init</a> is a new plugin that uses this hook to create database tables and views on startup if they have not yet been created. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/834">#834</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here's an example <code>datasette-init</code> plugin configuration in <code>metadata.yaml</code>. This will create a <code>dogs</code> table when the server starts, but only if one has not yet been created:</p>

 <code>plugins:
  datasette-init:
    my_database:
      tables:
        dogs:
          columns:
            id: integer
            name: text
            age: integer
            weight: float
          pk: id
</code> 

<blockquote><p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-canned-queries">canned_queries(datasette, database, actor)</a> lets plugins provide additional canned queries beyond those defined in Datasette's metadata. See <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-saved-queries">datasette-saved-queries</a> for an example of this hook in action. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/852">#852</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>This started out as <a href="https://twitter.com/amjithr/status/1273440766862352384">a feature request</a> from Amjith Ramanujam on Twitter.</p>

<p>Canned queries, like <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures#queries">these ones</a>, are usually defined in the increasingly poorly-named <code>metadata.json/yaml</code>.</p>

<p>Letting plugins define them opens up some neat possibilities. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-saved-queries">datasette-saved-queries</a> is an interesting example: it lets users store new queries in their database, inserting them using a writable canned query that the plugin itself returns from that hook by default.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-saved-queries/blob/b6b61af4ec3b3ff15e6101561dec8567847c881f/datasette_saved_queries/__init__.py">the code</a>. It also uses the new <code>startup()</code> hook to create its own table.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-forbidden">forbidden(datasette, request, message)</a> is a hook for customizing how Datasette responds to 403 forbidden errors. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/812">#812</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>I need this for the next version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github">datasette-auth-github</a> - it's a way to customize what happens when a user fails a permission check.</p>

 Even more plugins 

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/20/cookiecutter-plugins/">datasette-plugin cookiecutter template</a> I can turn out simple plugins in just a few minutes. Here are my new releases from the past week:</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-init">datasette-init</a>, described above.  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-write">datasette-write</a> provides a <code>/-/write</code> page that can be used to directly execute write SQL queries against a selected database.  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-allow-permissions-debug">datasette-allow-permissions-debug</a> which is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-allow-permissions-debug/blob/7d9d315082b70fd03a979acc0bf55df1443b3d27/datasette_allow_permissions_debug/__init__.py">absolutely tiny</a>. All it does is listen for <code>permissions-debug</code> checks and return <code>True</code> for them. This means you can access the <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#the-permissions-debug-tool">/-/permissions debug page</a> on your Datasette instance without authenticating first, which is handy for debugging.  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-glitch">datasette-glitch</a> is designed for use with <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. It outputs a magic one-time use URL to the private Glitch console which you can use to authenticate with your Datasette instance there as the <code>root</code> user.  I also released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a>, which allows users to configure API tokens to be used to access a private Datasette instance. It now lets you <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens/blob/0.2.1/README.md#tokens-from-your-database">store tokens in a database table</a> based on a configured SQL query. The <code>:_random_chars_32</code> magic parameter mentioned above can be used to help create new tokens.  

 What's next? 

<p>I've already slipped one feature into the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/16">Datasette 0.46 milestone</a>, but my focus from here on should really be on getting everything in place for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">Datasette 1.0</a>.</p>

<blockquote>This article is part of a series about XYZ and how it works, also including articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-why-b855970fdd89">Why?</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">Handles</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-interaction-a84091d2a8c8">Interaction</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-compatibility-with-oauth-2-f7b490be536d">Compatibility</a>.</blockquote><p>OAuth 2 loves its bearer tokens. They’re a really useful construct because they are simple: if you have the token, you can do whatever the token is good for. It’s all the proof that you need: you can present it in exactly the format that you received it in, no cryptography involved.</p><p>This simplicity makes it easy for client developers to get it right, most of the time. You give them a magic value, they put the magic value into the right header, and suddenly the API works and they can stop thinking about this security&nbsp;thing.</p> Sender Constraints <p>The downside to bearer tokens, and it is a big downside, is that anyone who has a copy of the token can use it. TLS protects the token in transit over a direct hop, but it doesn’t fix the fact that the people who are allowed to see the token aren’t the same as the people who are allowed to use the token. This means that if a client sends its token to a rogue resource server, or even the wrong resource server, then that resource server can replay the token somewhere else.</p><p>To address this in the OAuth 2 world, there is active work to define how to do sender constrained access tokens. These tokens would move beyond a bearer token by requiring the client to present some type of verifiable keying material, like a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">mutual TLS certificate</a> or an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop">ephemeral key generated by the client</a>. There was previously work of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding">using TLS token binding</a> as well, but that has sadly gone by the wayside as TLS token binding <a href="https://identiverse.com/2018/10/31/chrome-puts-token-binding-in-a-bind/">failed to take off</a>. These work pretty well, but there is an overwhelming prevalence of OAuth 2 code that looks for the Bearer keyword for the token type and breaks if you show it anything else. Because of this, the MTLS spec requires that you continue to use the Bearer token type, and there has even been pushback for DPoP to use Bearer as an option as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And on top of all of this, the token presentation is tangled up with the OAuth2 client authentication, which could be based on a secret, a key, or nothing at all (in the case of public clients).</p><p>With XYZ, we don’t have this legacy of bearer tokens and client authentication, and we were able to build a system that was more consistent from the&nbsp;start.</p> Presenting Keys <p>In XYZ, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/keys/">key presentation is at the core of all client interactions.</a> When a client calls the AS, it identifies itself by its key. The key formats in XYZ are flexible. A client can present its key as a JWK, an X509 certificate, or potentially any number of other formats through extensions. The key can be RSA, or elliptic curve, or potentially some other exotic form. The protocol doesn’t really care, so long as there’s a method to validate&nbsp;it.</p><p>This key can be <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">passed by value or by reference</a>, and the AS can even decide to assign a reference dynamically, but the important thing is that it’s the key that identifies the software that’s making the call. This alone is an important shift from OAuth 2, because specifications like MTLS for OAuth and DPoP have shown us the value in allowing a client to bind an ephemeral key to its requests. In XYZ, the default is that all client keys are ephemeral, unless the AS has some additional set of metadata and a policy attached to the&nbsp;key.</p><p>Whatever key the client uses for its requests to the AS, it’s reasonable that the client would be able to use that same key for requests to the RS. But in this case, the client is also going to be presenting the access token it was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>But unlike a bearer token, it’s not enough to present the token alone, or the key, or its identifier. The client also has to present proof that it currently holds that key to the server. It does this by performing a cryptographic operation on the request, in some fashion can be verified by the server and associated with the key. But&nbsp;how?</p> Agility of Presentation <p>Herein lies the real trick: a new delegation protocol is going to have to be flexible and agile in how the client is allowed to prove its keys. Just about every deployment is going to have its own considerations and constraints affecting everything from how keys are generated to how proofs can be validated across the&nbsp;layers.</p><p>In XYZ, we’ve made the key presentation modular. Instead of defining a required cryptographic container, XYZ declares that the client has to present the key in a manner bound to its request, in some fashion, and declare that proofing method. The two categories implemented to date are MTLS and HTTP-based message signatures.</p><p>For MTLS, it’s pretty straightforward. The client needs to use its client certificate during the TLS connection to the server, and the server needs to verify that the certificate in use is the same one referenced in the request — either the request body for the AS or the access token for the RS. The server does not need to do a full chain validation of the client’s certificate, though it’s free to do so in order to limit which certificates are presented.</p><p>For HTTP message signing it’s a similar outlay of effort, but the signature is presented at the HTTP layer and has to directly cover some or all of the HTTP request. There are a number of different specifications out there for doing this, and our test XYZ implementations have built out support for a several of them including Cavage signatures, OAuth DPoP, and even a simple JWS-based detached body signature invented for the protocol. The most promising, to my mind, is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures">new signatures specification being worked on in the HTTP working group of the IETF</a>. It’s being based on a long experience with several community specifications, and I think it’s really got a chance to be a unifying security layer across a lot of different applications. Eventually, we’re likely to see library and tooling support like we have with&nbsp;TLS.</p><p>The use cases for these are different. MTLS tends to work great for webserver-based applications, especially in a closed enterprise setup, but it falls apart for SPA’s and ephemeral apps. HTTP message signing is more complex to implement, but it can survive across TLS termination and multiple hops. There is no one answer, and there are likely other approaches that will be invented down the road that work even&nbsp;better.</p> Signatures as a Core&nbsp;Function <p>OAuth 1 had its own bespoke signing mechanism, which confused a lot of developers. OAuth 2 set out to avoid the problems that this caused by removing signatures entirely, but in so doing has pushed the needle too far away from good security practices and made it hard to add such functionality back in. With XYZ we tried to strike the balance by allowing different mechanisms but assuming that signing, of some fashion, was going to be available to every client. With today’s library and software support, this seems to be true across many platforms, and time will tell which methods work the best in the real&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/38809138">Originally written</a> as a post
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">for Patreon donors</a>.)</p>
<p>Hello... just figured I'd give a fairly brief update.  Since I wrote
my last post I've been working hard towards the distributed
programming stuff in Goblins.</p>
<p>In general, this involves implementing a protocol called
<a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/CapTP">CapTP</a>, which
is fairly obscure... the idea is generally to apply the same "object
capability security" concept that Goblins already follows but on a
networked protocol level.  Probably the most prominent other
implementation of CapTP right now is being done by the
<a href="https://agoric.com/">Agoric</a> folks,
<a href="https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/captp/lib/captp.js">captp.js</a>.
I've been in communication with them... could we achieve
interoperability between our implementations?  It could be cool, but
it's too early to tell.  Anyway it's one of those technical areas
that's so obscure that I decided to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I%5B1-25%5D">document my progress on the cap-talk mailing list</a>,
but that's becoming the length of a small novel... so I guess, beware
before you try to read that whole thing.  I'm far enough along where
the main things work, but not quite everything (CapTP supports such
wild things as distributed garbage collection...!!!!)</p>
<p>Anyway, in general I don't think that people get too excited by
hearing "backend progress is happening"; I believe that implementing
CapTP is even more important than standardizing ActivityPub was in the
long run of my life work, but I also am well aware that in general
people (including myself!) understand best by seeing an interesting
demonstration.  So, I do plan another networked demo, akin to the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time-travel Terminal Phase demo</a>,
but I'm not sure just how fancy it will be (yet).  I think I'll have
more things to show on that front in 1-2 months.</p>
<p>(Speaking of Goblins and games, I'm putting together a little library
called <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/game-goblin">Game Goblin</a>
to make making games on top of Goblins a bit easier; it isn't quite
ready yet but thought I'd mention it.  It's currently going through
some "user testing".)</p>
<p>More work is happening on the Datashards front; Serge Wroclawski
(project leader for Datashards; I guess you could say I'm "technical
engineer") and I have started assembling more documentation and have
put together <a href="https://datashards.net/">some proto-standards documents</a>.
(Warning: WIP WIP WIP!!!)  We are exploring with a standards group
whether or not Datashards would be a good fit there, but it's too
early to talk about that since the standards group is still figuring
it out themselves.  Anyway, it's taken up a good chunk of time so I
figured it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>So, more to come, and hopefully demos not too far ahead.</p>
<p>But let's end on a fun note.  In-between all that (and various things
at home, of course), I have taken a bit of what might resemble
"downtime" and I'm learning how to make ~chiptunes / "tracker music"
with <a href="https://milkytracker.titandemo.org/">Milkytracker</a>, which is
just a lovely piece of software.  (I've also been learning more about
<a href="http://www.drpetter.se/article_sound.html">sound theory</a> and have
been figuring out how to compose some of my own samples/"instruments"
from code.)  Let me be clear, I'm not very good at it, but it's fun
to learn a new thing.  Here's a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.flac">dollhouse piano thing</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.xm">XM file</a>), the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/ecto-house.flac">start of a haunted video game level</a>

<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/peggy-noonan-says-trump-cannot-lead-in-a-crisis-and-calls-on-biden-to-step-up-2020-06-26">Yesterday’s audio blog post</a>&nbsp;(again, not a podcast—I already do <a href="http://reality2cast.com">two</a> of <a href="https://twit.tv/floss">those</a>) had 81 visits during that day and another couple dozen this morning. It also got one response on Facebook, a few on Twitter and a couple by email and other channels. Two responses were to the substance of the post, and one addressed the issue of recording while walking. Which I admit was an issue. Two people walking together can tolerate the other one panting a bit, but on headphones (or even speakers) it’s a chore to listen.</p>
<p>But the response I got was sufficiently encouraging for me to do one more.</p>
<p>I recorded this one last night while walking, before I got the feedback this morning about problems with doing that. So this time, in addition to converting the file to .mp3, I went through it and cut out as much panting as I could. If I continue doing this, I’ll do it while sitting or standing still.</p>
<p>Again, this is an experiment in communication. At issue is whether it’s more worthwhile to talk to people or to write to them. The subjects of yesterday’s post and today’s are topics I’ve written about already. I’m not linking to them here because I want to see if talking in some way outperforms writing. If it does, I’ll keep it up. If not, I’ll keep talking anyway, most mostly not here. And, of course, I’ll keep writing as well, because that’s what I do. So here ya go.</p>

<p>My blog post permalinks have been bothering me for a while, I feel like they are too cluttered. I mostly like the design of my notes and photos permalinks, since the content on those pages is relatively short, I don't mind how much other stuff on the page there is since it's also good for discoverability of my other content. However on my blog posts, people often come to those from some external source, and they're really there just to read the blog post and then leave. So I wanted to clean it up a bit.</p>
<p>Here's what my blog post pages looked like before.</p>

<p>This is on a 13" Macbook screen with a browser as wide as possible. Here is what the blog posts look like now.</p>

<p>I wanted to give the blog posts a bit more space, so I increased the size of the middle column. I also took out the top bar with the clock and weather. I removed my little author avatar (it duplicated my name, and the photo wasn't really placed very well.) I also changed the timestamp to show just the date, instead of the full date and time and timezone. For notes and photos the time is possibly relevant, but it's really not important for blog posts.</p>
<p>I also added a custom font, which tbh I'm on the fence about using. I do feel like the slightly wider font goes well with the slightly larger column.</p>
<p>So that's the first of the projects for the day done!</p>
<p>Update: Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sl007/104423151649889418">a suggestion from Sebastian</a>, I also increased the font size on the blog posts to keep a similar number of characters per line.</p>

  I finally made the jump from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for my Postgres extensions. Here’s how you can, too.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist
   - todo/fix: check why summary can be nil/null
   note: content goes first; than try summary
 -->
<div class='wrap'>

 
         
<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>
  

 <code> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
</code> 

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
32
</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>Summary:      If your identity system doesn't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then it's not SSI.</p>


<a></a>
 

A few days ago I was in a conversation with a couple of my <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/who-are-the-identerati">identerati</a> friends. When one used the term "SSI", the other asked him to define it since there were so many systems that were claiming to be SSI and yet were seemingly different. That's a fair question. So I thought I'd write down my definition in hopes of stimulating some conversation around the topic. 
<p></p>

<p>
    I think we've arrived at a place where it's possible to define SSI and get broad consensus about it. SSI stands for self-sovereign identity, but that's not really helpful since people have different ideas about what "sovereign" means and what "identity" means. So, rather than try to go down those rabbit holes, let's just stick with "SSI."1
</p>

<p>
    SSI has the following properties:
</p>
 
     SSI systems use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) to identify people, organizations, and things. Decentralized identifiers provide a cryptograhic basis for the system and can be employed so that they don't require a central administrative system to manage and control the identifiers. Exchanging DIDs is how participants in SSI create relationships. 
     

     SSI participants use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials exchange</a> to share information (attributes) with each other to strengthen or enrich relationships. The system provides the means of establishing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">credential fidelity</a>. 
     

     SSI supports autonomy for participants. The real value proposition of SSI is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy implies that participants interact as peers in the system. You can build systems that use DIDs and verifiable credentials without giving participants autonomy. 
     
 

<p>
    Beyond these there are lots of choices system architects are making. Debates rage about how specifically credential exchange should work, whether distributed ledgers are necessary, and, if so, how should they be employed. But if you don't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then you're not doing SSI.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence of these properties, participants in SSI systems use some kind of software agent (typically called a wallet for individuals) to create relationships and exchange credentials. They don't typically see or manage keys or passwords. And there's no artifact called an "identity." The primary artifacts are relationships and credentials. The user experience involves managing these artifacts to share attributes within relationships via credential exchange. This user experience should be common to all SSI systems, although the user interface and what happens under the covers might be different between SSI systems or vendors on those systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful that, as we work more on interoperability, the implementation differences will fade away so that we have a single identity metasystem where participants have <a>choice about tools and vendors</a>. An identity metasystem is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios that the world presents us</a> and will support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">digital interactions that are life-like</a>. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     This is not to say I don't have opinions on what those words mean in this context. I've written about "sovereign" in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">On Sovereignty</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">Self Sovereign is Not Self Asserted</a>.

  <p>I spent this week spreading myself between a bunch of smaller projects, and finally getting familiar with <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/">cookiecutter</a>. I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/20/cookiecutter-plugins/">my datasette-plugin cookiecutter template</a> earlier in the week; here's what else I've been working on.</p>

 sqlite-generate 

<p>Datasette is supposed to work against any SQLite database you throw at it, no matter how weird the schema or how unwieldy the database shape or size.</p>

<p>I built a new tool called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-generate">sqlite-generate</a> this week to help me create databases of different shapes. It's a Python command-line tool which uses <a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io/">Faker</a> to populate a new database with random data. You run it something like this:</p>

 <code>sqlite-generate demo.db \
    --tables=20 \
    --rows=100,500 \
    --columns=5,20 \
    --fks=0,3 \
    --pks=0,2 \
    --fts</code> 

<p>This command creates a database containing 20 tables, each with between 100 and 500 rows and 5-20 columns. Each table will also have between 0 and 3 foreign key columns to other tables, and will feature between 0 and 2 primary key columns. SQLite full-text search will be configured against all of the text columns in the table.</p>

<p>I always try to include a live demo with any of my projects, and <code>sqlite-generate</code> is no exception. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-generate/blob/main/.github/workflows/demo.yml">This GitHub Action</a> runs on every push to main and deploys a demo to <a href="https://sqlite-generate-demo.datasette.io/">https://sqlite-generate-demo.datasette.io/</a> showing the latest version of the code in action.</p>

<p>The demo runs my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-search-all">datasette-search-all</a> plugin in order to more easily demonstrate full-text search across all of the text columns in the generated tables. Try searching for <a href="https://sqlite-generate-demo.datasette.io/-/search?q=newspaper">newspaper</a>.</p>

 click-app cookiecutter template 

<p>I write quite a lot of <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> powered command-line tools like this one, so inspired by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">datasette-plugin</a> I created a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">click-app</a> cookiecutter template that bakes in my own preferences about how to set up a new Click project (complete with GitHub Actions). <code>sqlite-generate</code> is the first tool I've built using that template.</p>

 Improved Datasette plugin documentation 

<p>I've split Datasette's plugin documentation into five separate pages, and added a new page to the documentation about patterns for testing plugins.</p>

<p>The five pages are:</p>

  <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html">Plugins</a> describing how to install and configure plugins  <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_plugins.html">Writing plugins</a> showing how to write one-off plugins, how to use the <code>datasette-plugin</code> cookiecutter template and how to package templates for release to PyPI  <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html">Plugin hooks</a> documenting all of the available plugin hooks  <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing_plugins.html">Testing plugins</a> describing my preferred patterns for writing tests for them (using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> and <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">HTTPX</a>)  <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internals.html">Internals for plugins</a> describing the APIs Datasette makes available for use within plugin hook implementations  

<p>There's also a <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ecosystem.html#datasette-plugins">list of available plugins</a> on the Datasette Ecosystem page of the documentation, though I plan to move those to a separate plugin directory in the future.</p>

 datasette-block-robots 

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">datasette-plugin</a> template practically eliminates the friction involved in starting a new plugin.</p>

<p><code>sqlite-generate</code> generates random names for people. I don't particularly want people who search for their own names stumbling across the live demo and being weirded out by their name featured there, so I decided to block it from search engine crawlers using <code>robots.txt</code>.</p>

<p>I wrote a tiny plugin to do this: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-block-robots">datasette-block-robots</a>, which uses the new <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#register-routes">register_routes() plugin hook</a> to add a <code>/robots.txt</code> page.</p>

<p>It's also a neat example of the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-block-robots/blob/main/datasette_block_robots/__init__.py">simplest possible plugin</a> to use that feature - along with the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-block-robots/blob/main/tests/test_block_robots.py">simplest possible unit test</a> for exercising such a page.</p>

 datasette-saved-queries 

<p>Another new plugin, this time with a bit more substance to it. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-saved-queries">datasette-saved-queries</a> exercises the new <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#canned-queries-datasette-database-actor">canned_queries()</a> hook I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/19/datasette-alphas/">described last week</a>. It uses the new <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#startup-datasette">startup()</a> hook to create tables on startup (if they are missing), then lets users insert records into those tables to save their own queries. Queries saved in this way are then returned as canned queries for that particular database.</p>

 main, not master 

<p><code>main</code> is a better name for the main GitHub branch than <code>master</code>, which has unpleasant connotations (it apparently derives from master/slave in BitKeeper). My <code>datasette-plugin</code> and <code>click-app</code> cookiecutter templates both include instructions for renaming <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> in their READMEs - it's as easy as running <code>git branch -m master main</code> before running your first push to GitHub.</p>

<p>I'm working towards <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/849">making the switch</a> for Datasette itself.</p>

<p></p><p>Nine months ago, I joined <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a> as Head of Engineering. It's my first fintech company.</p><p>Long-term readers will know that I've spent most of my life in the open source web world, building <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/do-ordinary-users-care-about-data-portability-and-if-not-should-they-four-social-networks-respond/">one of the first white label social networking platforms</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/meet-ben-3293ac936c69">in media</a>, where I helped build the way journalists at networks like NBC <a href="https://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/how-euronews-nbc-approaches-iphone-journalism">securely send footage back to the newsroom</a>. Every startup I've ever joined has had a strong social mission; here, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-the-widening-wealth-gap-is-bad-news-for-everyone-51592617966">in the midst of widening income inequality</a>, we're trying to help ordinary people <a href="https://www.forusall.com/401k-blog/why-we-built-the-cares-act-401-k-calculator-and-virtual-advisor/">build a stronger financial future</a>.</p><p>This is my personal space; opinions here, <a href="https://werd.io">as in all of my posts</a>, are mine alone.</p><p>Here are some things I've observed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Financial technology is broken.</p><p>It's common for financial institutions to have web platforms that look like they were built in 1998. Some of them were. I'm certain that some smaller institutions are running their software on decrepit Windows servers. APIs are virtually nonexistent. Interoperability between institutions is often in the form of faxes (you read that correctly; please breathe) or checks in the mail.</p><p>Over in Europe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_banking">open banking has become an important movement</a>. It's inevitable that institutions in the US will need to modernize to adopt similar ideas. The institutions that haven't invested in in-house technology, or don't have strong technology partnerships, are going to find themselves in very rocky waters.</p><p>Elsewhere, businesses understand that open, standard APIs are a way to build ecosystems and gain value through partnerships. They also understand that they need to build technical teams that are first-class contributors to the business. In the financial sector, a very closed, old-world view of technology is still prevelant. The institutions that can't let go of these archaic mindsets will eventually die. There's a new batch of fintech startups - ForUsAll among them, alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/">Chime</a> and <a href="https://digit.co/">Digit</a> - that will take their place and redefine the ecosystem.</p><p>Which brings me to ...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Scraping is everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAElSL7GWfwmsFFzAt9ko3pj_jmemQJnPnWC3RGuR5ERTsfVW45DVQIFFroTz3rJdgvQtXrDhJTHWk_c1pVa-ngZoMj1DQiCU0auDAS5H9VEz9gTcu4sZL377WFbDveGnxfvKTCdQPMg2o7wmJXNJ3CLBbpQQQcZGTkB348CZELUi">Plaid was recently acquired by Visa for $5.3 billion</a>. It provides a unified auth and limited API for most institutions. Its connections are sort of flaky, but it's remarkably better than the previous status quo.</p><p>And it largely works using <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>.</p><p>Because institutions don't have APIs, Plaid spends a lot of time and energy maintaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser">headless browsers</a> to log into banking websites on your behalf. In order to be able to log in, <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/198005/is-plaid-a-service-which-collects-user-s-banking-login-information-safe-to-use">it has to be saving your banking password in plain text</a>. (Compare and contrast with a typical API, which would use <a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-token-based-authentication/">secure, revokable tokens for authentication</a>.)</p><p>If you're connecting to a bank using Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase, and others, you're probably saving your banking password in plain text in Plaid. Infuriatingly, because there are no APIs, let alone API standards, there's very little alternative. But it's worth saying that if you're giving credentials to a third party, many banks will absolve themselves of any liability in a data breach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Operations teams are vital.</p><p>The first rule of technology on the internet is that if it looks like magic, there's probably an army of people in an office park somewhere (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/">often the Philippines</a>) making it happen. In the finance world, a lot of the magic isn't done by technology as much as teams of people whose role is to reconcile data and perform financial operations that can't be automated.</p><p>There's room for a kind of Financial Operations as a Service platform - but because of the sensitive data involved, the workers on demand would need to be certified, heavily insured, and security tested. You'd also lose their most important feature: the institutional knowledge about a customer that is grown when you spend time with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. There's a lot of opportunity for growth.</p><p>Institutional technology myopia means there's a lot of room for innovators to enter the market and change it for the better.</p><p>But there's also a lot of opportunity to create ecosystems. Perhaps that's even how you win: create an open ecosystem that allows institutions to easily interoperate with each other in a peer-to-peer, secure way. The older institutions won't bother to connect, but the newer ones could potentially form alliances and band together. Eventually, the incumbent institutions will have to join in.</p><p>Imagine a banking system built on openness, human-centered design, software libraries, SDKs, and running code, instead of armies of Excel spreadsheets and ties behind desks.</p><p>Imagine beautiful experiences that give you full control over your money. Imagine institutions that aren't all just controlled by old, white men for their own benefit. Imagine wealth for all.</p><p>It sounds kind of good, right?</p><p>Now imagine the ecosystem that makes it all possible.</p><p>I know what you think that sounds like. I know what many readers are going to say. But trust me:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. It's not about blockchain.</p><p>Programmable money isn't cool. You know what's cool? Money people can use.</p><p>I'm sure there will come a time when cryptocurrencies do allow the open banking ecosystem I describe above to be built. But that time isn't now. And while I'm grateful for the people working on building the financial system of 2030, we still need to drag the existing one into the 21st century.</p><p>Again: people are, today in 2020, using faxes and paper checks as forms of inter-bank communication. When technology is used, user passwords are often saved in plain text. And many of the people involved don't really see anything wrong with it. Blockchain might be one of the technologies that helps us, but the point isn't about technology; the point is what people are able to do with their money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. It&nbsp;is about wealth for all.</p><p>So that's what we need to build. We need to build the infrastructure that brings banking in line with today, in that way that the internet is so good at, where gatekeepers are crushed and ordinary people are empowered.</p><p>In the nineties, we empowered everyone to communicate. In the 2000s, we let everyone publish. In the 2010s, we put limitless knowledge in everyone's hands, wherever they were. And in the 2020s, we're going to reimagine the financial system to be an open ecosystem where anyone can innovate, for the benefit of us all. The old gatekeepers will give way to new, decentralized tapestries of value, where anyone can share, earn, and save in a way that they fully control.</p><p>The 2020s are about tearing down the same old thing and building something more equitable and agile in its place. That's the opportunity - and it's an opportunity for all of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Austin Distel</a> on <a href="https://werd.io/s/photos/finance?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Few people in the real estate industry know this month marks the 16th anniversary of the first convention for fee-for-service real estate agents.  For consumers, the <a href="http://bit.ly/NAREC_Conv2004" title="http://bit.ly/NAREC_Conv2004">agenda</a> for that two-day event is less important than the availability of local money-savings options and the track record of those alternative business models.  Rather than focusing on how much money Real Estate Cafe has <a href="http://bit.ly/Shop4EBA">saved clients</a> over the past 25 years, guess who said the quote in the photo above?</p>



<blockquote><p>“The next major revolution in real estate will be fee-based services replacing the blanket commission pricing that has dominated the industry for so long.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Would you believe that was the former chief economist of the National Association of Realtors in a cover story in 1997?  </p>



<p>Historical Context</p>



<p>From our perspective, there have been five phases of the fee-for-service movement in real estate.  Arguably, the movement showed most promise in the 4th phase when SoloPro generated buzz in the real estate industry as well as a Wall Street Journal article in 2016 but their on-demand model failed to scale despite an investment and strategic partnership with Lowes.</p>



<p>In October 2019, fee-for-service was once again held up as the future of residential brokerage when the New York Times published an economist’s description of How to Get a Better Deal From a Real Estate Agent.  My hope is that will launch the 5th phase — the mass socialization of fee-for-service through a network of independent real estate consultants who collaborate, as needed, like millions of others in the gig economy.</p>



<p>What will it take to create a mass  adoption / socialization?</p>



<p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/re2020?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWLzha3qI0gx6lptMhEqIjreFEDkHjpAw1F6yhIrYQXL_YuGwcIQUFBvWi00FW04H29WM2Fkl-VQ5UlKAA7WLxn2zKsCG2SOl-V5_9cYnQHGqA9M5mf4sgFZPS3W-2BTJK95uLJ1uiqRQfDmuwwU_wYnf_NoTX7Oc6d2RVf7oqoJA&amp;__tn__=*NK-R">#RE2020</a>: Idea Bar</p>



<p>Idea Starter / Thought experiment: As @RealEstateCafe turns 25, we’re eager to experiment more intentionally with RECafePRO — a network of fellow fee-for-service pioneers willing to act as consultants on a task-by-task or project-by-project basis.  Our goal is to form elite teams on the fly or over an extended period of time to offer high level services “a la carte.’  By working with fellow #RESages — solo entrepreneurs with deep experience, our goal is to EXCEED the level of expertise you’ll find at megabrokers and deliver millions in consumer savings without in-house conflicts of interest.  </p>



<p>How can we create awareness of those money-saving opportunities?  Gamification may be one way to spread into mass socialization — friendly competitions between rival groups, like alumni, cities or neighborhoods to see who can save the most money </p>



<p>To drive mass adoption, we won’t stop there.  Working with a network of partners,  we’ll invite friendly rivals to see how much social good they can do by sharing a part of their savings with their classmates,  neighbors, etc.  Think impact funding or crowdfunding via real estate rebates or <a>#ImpactREbates</a>.</p>



<p>Want to use Facebook’s new Messenger Room to brainstorm how we harness that network power and transform commission savings into a consumer movement to fund grassroots projects?  Text your contact into to 617-661-4046 and we’ll invite you to one of our upcoming RE2020 Idea Bars.</p>

<p>Remember the dot com boom?</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter if you don’t. What does matter is that it ended. All business manias do.</p>
<p>That’s why we can expect the “platform economy” and “surveillance capitalism” to end. Sure, it’s hard to imagine that when we’re in the midst of the mania, but the end will come.</p>
<p>When it does, we can have a “privacy debate.” Meanwhile, there isn’t one. In fact there&nbsp;can’t be one, because we don’t have privacy in the online world.</p>
<p>We do have privacy in the offline world, and we’ve had it ever since we invented clothing, doors, locks and norms for signaling what’s okay and what’s not okay in respect to our personal spaces, possessions and information.</p>
<p>That we hardly have the equivalent in the networked world doesn’t mean we won’t. Or that we can’t. The Internet in its current form was only born in the mid-’90s. In the history of business and culture, that’s a blip.</p>
<p>Really, it’s still early.</p>
<p>So, the fact that websites, network services, phone companies, platforms, publishers, advertisers and governments violate our privacy with wanton disregard for it doesn’t mean we can’t ever stop them. It means we haven’t done it yet, because we don’t have the tech for it. (Sure, some wizards do, but muggles don’t. And most of us are muggles.)</p>
<p>And, since we don’t have privacy tech yet, we lack the simple norms that grow around technologies that give us ways signal our privacy preferences. We’ll get those when we have the digital equivalents of buttons, zippers, locks, shades, curtains, door knockers and bells.</p>
<p>This is what many of us have been working on at <a href="http://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a>, <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, the <a href="http://me2b.us">Me2B Alliance</a>, <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a> and other organizations whose mission is getting each of us the tech we need to operate at full agency when dealing with the companies and governments of the world.</p>
<p>I bring all this up as a “Yes, and” to a piece in&nbsp;Salon&nbsp;by Michael Corn (@<a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelAlanCorn">MichaelAlanCorn</a>), <a href="https://cio.ucop.edu/meet-mike-corn-uc-san-diego-ciso/">CISO</a> of UCSD, titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/06/20/were-losing-the-war-against-surveillance-capitalism-because-we-let-big-tech-frame-the-debate/">We’re losing the war against surveillance capitalism because we let Big Tech frame the debate</a>. Subtitle: “It’s too late to conserve our privacy — but to preserve what’s left, we must stop defining people as commodities.”</p>
<p>Indeed. And we do need the “optimism and activism” he calls for. In the activism category is code. Specifically, code that gives us the digital equivalents of buttons, zippers, locks, shades, curtains, door knockers and bells</p>
<p>Some of those are in the works. Others are not—yet. But they will be. Inevitably. Especially now that it’s becoming clearer every day that we’ll never get them from any system with a financial interest in violating it*. Or from laws that fail at protecting it.</p>

 This smacks of the Catholic Church operating like a large multinational corporation …

  <p>Datasette’s <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html">plugin system</a> is one of the most interesting parts of the entire project. As I explained to Matt Asay in <a href="https://thenewstack.io/datasette-a-developer-a-shower-and-a-data-inspired-moment/">this interview</a>, the great thing about plugins is that Datasette can gain new functionality overnight without me even having to review a pull request. I just need to get more people to write them!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">datasette-plugin</a> is my most recent effort to help make that as easy as possible. It’s a <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/">cookiecutter</a> template that sets up the outline of a new plugin, combining various best patterns I’ve discovered over the past two years of writing my own plugins.</p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html">installed cookiecutter</a> you can start building a new plugin by running:</p>
 <code>cookiecutter gh:simonw/datasette-plugin
</code> 
<p>Cookiecutter will run a quick interactive session asking for a few details. It will then use those details to generate a new directory structure ready for you to start work on the plugin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/blob/main/README.md">datasette-plugin README</a> describes the next steps. A couple of things are worth exploring in more detail.</p>
 Writing tests for plugins 
<p>I’m a big believer in automated testing: every single one of my plugins includes tests, and those test are run against every commit and must pass before new packages are shipped to <a href="https://pypi.org">PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience the hardest part of writing tests is getting them started: setting up an initial test harness and ensuring that new tests can be easily written.</p>
<p><code>datasette-plugin</code> adds <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> as a testing dependency and creates a <code>tests/</code> folder with an initial, passing unit test in it.</p>
<p>The test confirms that the new plugin has been correctly installed, by running a request through a configured Datasette instance and hitting the <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introspection.html#plugins">/-/plugins.json introspection endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>In doing so, it demonstrates how to run tests that interact with Datasette’s HTTP API. This is a very productive way to write tests.</p>
<p>The example test uses the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org">HTTPX</a> Python library. HTTPX offers a requests-style API but with a couple of crucial improvements. Firstly, it’s been built with asyncio support as a top-level concern. Secondly, it <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/async/#calling-into-python-web-apps">understands the ASGI protocol</a> and can be run directly against an ASGI Python interface without needing to spin up an actual HTTP server. Since Datasette <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jun/23/datasette-asgi/">speaks ASGI</a> this makes it the ideal tool for testing Datasette plugins.</p>
<p>Here’s that first test that gets created by the cookiecutter template:</p>
 <code>from datasette.app import Datasette
import pytest
import httpx

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_plugin_is_installed():
    app = Datasette([], memory=True).app()
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(app=app) as client:
        response = await client.get(
            "http://localhost/-/plugins.json"
        )
        assert 200 == response.status_code
        installed_plugins = {
            p["name"] for p in response.json()
        }
        assert "datasette-plugin-template-demo" in installed_plugins
</code> 
<p>My hope is that including a passing test that demonstrates how to execute test requests will make it much easier for plugin authors to start building out their own custom test suite.</p>
 Continuous integration with GitHub Actions 
<p>My favourite thing about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/githubactions/">GitHub Actions</a> is that they’re enabled on every GitHub repository for free, without any extra configuration necessary.</p>
<p>The <code>datasette-plugin</code> template takes advantage of this. Not only does every new project get a passing test - it also gets a GitHub Action - in <code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code> - that executes the tests on every commit.</p>
<p>It even <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/blob/8e4d5231bc276f19ccf630b18f075222e5afecb3/datasette-%7B%7Bcookiecutter.hyphenated%7D%7D/.github/workflows/test.yml#L8-L10">runs the test suite in parallel</a> against Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 - the versions currently supported by Datasette itself.</p>
<p>A second action in <code>.github/workflows/publish.yml</code> bakes in my opinions on the best way to manage plugin releases: it builds and ships a new package to PyPI every time a new tag (and corresponding GitHub release) is added to the repository.</p>
<p>For this to work you’ll need to create a <a href="https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken">PyPI API token</a> and add it to your plugin’s GitHub repository as a <code>PYPI_TOKEN</code> secret. This is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/blob/main/README.md#publishing-your-plugin-as-a-package-to-pypi">explained in the README</a>.</p>
 Deploying a live demo of the template with GitHub Actions 
<p>Whenever possible, I like to ship my projects with live demos. The Datasette repository <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-latest.yml">publishes a demo</a> of the latest commit to <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/">https://latest.datasette.io/</a> on every commit. I try to do the same for my plugins, where it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p>What could a live demo of a cookiecutter template look like?</p>
<p>Ideally it would show a complete, generated project. I love GitHub’s code browsing interface, so a separate repository containing that generated project would be ideal.</p>
<p>So that’s what <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-demo">https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-demo</a> is: it’s a repository showing the most recent output of the latest version of the cookiecutter template that lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin</a>.</p>
<p>It’s powered by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/blob/main/.github/workflows/push.yml">this GitHub Action</a>, which runs on every push to the <code>datasette-plugin</code> repo, installs cookiecutter, uses cookiecutter against some <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/blob/main/input-for-demo.txt">fixed inputs</a> to re-generate the project and then pushes the results up to <code>datasette-plugin-template-demo</code> as a new commit.</p>
<p>As a fun final touch, it uses the GitHub commit comments API to add a comment to the commit to <code>datasette-plugin</code> linking to the “browse” view on the resulting code in the <code>datasette-plugin-template-demo</code> repository. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/commit/8e4d5231bc276f19ccf630b18f075222e5afecb3">one of those commit comments</a>.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to build this took quite a bit of work. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin/issues/4">Issue #4</a> has a blow-by-blow rundown of how I got it working.</p>
<p>I couldn’t resist tweeting about it:</p>

  We wrote the specification COSE and JOSE Registrations for WebAuthn Algorithms to create and register COSE and JOSE algorithm and elliptic curve identifiers for algorithms used by WebAuthn and CTAP2 that didn’t yet exist. I’m happy to report that all these registrations are now complete and the specification has progressed to the RFC Editor. Thanks […]

<p>We wrote the specification <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-webauthn-algorithms-08">COSE and JOSE Registrations for WebAuthn Algorithms</a> to create and register COSE and JOSE algorithm and elliptic curve identifiers for algorithms used by WebAuthn and CTAP2 that didn’t yet exist.  I’m happy to report that all these registrations are now complete and the specification has progressed to the RFC Editor.  Thanks to the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cose/about/">COSE working group</a> for supporting this work.</p>
<p>Search for WebAuthn in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml">IANA COSE Registry</a> and the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml">IANA JOSE Registry</a> to see the registrations.  These are now stable and can be used by applications, both in the WebAuthn/FIDO2 space and for other application areas, including decentralized identity (where the <code>secp256k1</code> “bitcoin curve” is in widespread use).</p>
<p>The algorithms registered are:</p>
 
 <code>RS256</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 – new for COSE 
 <code>RS384</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384 – new for COSE 
 <code>RS512</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512 – new for COSE 
 <code>RS1</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-1 – new for COSE 
 <code>ES256K</code> – ECDSA using secp256k1 curve and SHA-256 – new for COSE and JOSE

  <p>A relatively quiet week this week, compared to last week's massive push to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">ship Datasette 0.44</a> with authentication, permissions and writable canned queries. I can now ship alpha releases, such as today's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.45a1">Datasette 0.45a1</a>, which means I can preview new plugin features before they are completely ready and stable.</p>

 Datasette alphas and betas 

<p>I want to be able to iterate on plugin hooks more effectively, which means embracing release early, release often. I also want plugin authors to be able to trust Datasette not to break their work - a major focus for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/519#issuecomment-636330023">Datasette 1.0</a>.</p>

<p>Releasing alpha preview versions can really help here. I have two plugin hooks in the pipeline for Datasette 0.45 already: <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#startup-datasette">startup</a> and <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#canned-queries-datasette-database-actor">canned_queries</a>. These are still under development but are now available to preview in Datasette 0.45a1. Install it like so:</p>

 <code>pip install datasette==0.45a1</code> 

<p>Please post any feedback on the design of these hooks to the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/834">startup hook</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/852">canned_queries hook</a> issue threads.</p>

<p>Another compelling reason to ship alphas: it means I can release alpha versions of my own plugins that themselves depend on a Datasette alpha, and still have their unit tests pass in continuous integration. I expect to take advantage of that ability a lot in the future.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to safely ship an alpha took a little bit of work, because I wanted to make sure that alphas wouldn't become the default version installed from PyPI, mess up my existing CI configuration or end up accidentally published to Docker Hub. You can follow my research on this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/807">in this issue</a>, including my experiments shipping an alpha for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-images">datasette-render-images</a> first.</p>

 Those new plugin hooks 

<p><code>startup()</code> (<a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#startup-datasette">documentation</a>) is a hook that gets called on Datasette server startup, and passed the <code>datasette</code> object. The initial use-case was plugins that might want to validate their own configuration, but I imagine other interesting uses for it will emerge over time.</p>

<p><code>canned_queries()</code> (<a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#canned-queries-datasette-database-actor">documentation</a>) lets plugin authors dynamically generate new <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">canned queries</a> for a given database. It gets passed the datasette object, the current database name and the currently authenticated actor, if there is one. This means you can do fun things like include a user's own saved queries loaded from another database table:</p>

 <code>from datasette import hookimpl

@hookimpl
def canned_queries(datasette, database, actor):
    async def inner():
        db = datasette.get_database(database)
        if actor is not None and await db.table_exists("saved_queries"):
            results = await db.execute(
                "select name, sql from saved_queries where actor_id = :id", {
                    "id": actor["id"]
                }
            )
            return {result["name"]: {
                "sql": result["sql"]
            } for result in results}
    return inner</code> 

<p>I'm using a pattern here that's shared by a number of other Datasette plugin hooks: rather than returning the results directly, this plugin function returns an <code>async def inner()</code> function.</p>

<p>The code that calls the hook knows that if an <code>asyncio</code> awaitable function is returned it should <code>await</code> it. This is my trick for using awaitable functions with <a href="https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pluggy</a>, which wasn't initially built with async in mind.</p>

 Shooting naturalist videos with Natalie 

<p>Natalie has started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu_N3UP2o8JdnNmGAhYRijQ">new YouTube channel</a> to put her various science communication courses at Stanford into action. I've been helping out as camera-person, which has been really interesting. I'm currently shooting with FiLMiC running on an iPhone 11 Pro on a tripod, using audio from an AirPod (until we can get our hands on something better).</p>

<p>Natalie's been editing the videos on her iPhone and these early results are really good! Here's the video we shot for Sea Lion Birthday on 15th June, a day when 50% of all California Sea Lions celebrate their birthday. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2B_cbp34D8">the video</a> to find out why.</p>

<p>The close-up footage of the sea lions was shot by Natalie on a Canon DSLR with a 100-400mm lens. I love that lens so much for wildlife photography.</p>



 TIL this week 

<p>Just one new TIL this week but it's a good one: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/sqlite/ld-preload.md">Using LD_PRELOAD to run any version of SQLite with Python</a>. I've been wanting to figure out a good way to replace the SQLite version used by the Python standard library for ages - <a href="https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3">pysqlite3</a> helps a lot here, but I also need the ability to run arbitrary older versions to help respond to bug reports. The <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> trick works perfectly for that.</p>

It could also be used with native applications, but <a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/auth/overview#identifying-your-application-to-users">it was awkward at best</a> due to many of the assumptions built into the OAuth 1 model. To be fair, smartphones didn’t really exist yet, and the handful of clunky desktop apps could more or less be dealt with via a few hacks. In OAuth 2, we at least admitted that mobile applications were now A Thing and created the notion of a public client with no recognizable credentials of its own. But it turned out that wasn’t enough, and we needed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">additional tools</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252">additional guidance for developers</a> to get mobile applications right. Even later, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps">single-page applications</a> really came into their own, further defying previous assumptions about OAuth clients. Smart devices and the internet of things drove a world of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">new interaction methods</a> and even <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html">new ideas about what logging in means</a>. And all of this is on top of OAuth’s core set of grant types, the differences between which are largely driven by the abilities of different clients.</p><p>This kind of flexibility and adaptability is one of OAuth 2’s greatest successes, so what’s the problem? Simply put, OAuth 2 makes a lot of assumptions that the user has access to a web browser which is on the same device as the client. In today’s world of smart clients, rich applications, and constrained devices, these assumptions no longer match reality and there’s a real need for a system with more flexibility. While browsers are certainly still around, we aren’t just connecting two websites to each other anymore, and our security protocols should reflect&nbsp;that.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rmrdnl?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Daniel Romero</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Getting the User&nbsp;Involved <p>In OAuth 2, the type of interaction that the client is capable of is defined by the authorization grant that’s in use. This dictates, among other things, how the user gets to the AS and how they get back from the AS to the client. In the authorization code grant, which is at the core of the OAuth 2 protocol design, the user is redirected in both directions through HTTP. The client has to choose exactly one way of dealing with the user before it starts, and this leads to awkward situations like the Device Grant letting the user interactively enter a code at a static URL or having a pre-composed URL that the user just follows. It also means that different grant types need to re-invent parts of the process used in other grant types just so that they can do things a little differently.</p><p>But what if we could decompose all of these aspects and get away from a type-based system? In XYZ, instead of choosing a grant type, a client declares all of the different parts of interaction that it supports. The AS then responds with appropriate responses to whatever portions it supports for that request. From there, the client can take action based on whatever portions make sense. After all, the client knows how it can interact with the user. With these tools, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/interaction/">XYZ’s interaction model allows for a very rich set of interactions</a>.</p><p>In XYZ, we wanted to enable the traditional redirect-based interaction but not depend on it. To do that, the client tells the AS that it can handle redirecting the user to an arbitrary URL, and also signals that it can get the user back on a similar redirect. With this, we’ve got everything we need for an authorization code style interaction.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "callback": {<br>            "uri": "https://client.foo",<br>            "nonce": "VJLO6A4CAYLBXHTR0KRO"<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>OK, but what if we’re now talking about a set-top box that can’t pop open a browser? Here we take a clue from the OAuth 2 device grant and say that we could display an arbitrary code, but at a static URL. We expect the user to go there on a secondary device, and so we don’t have a good way to get the user back at the client&nbsp;itself.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "user_code": true<br>    }<br>} <p>This is great, but what if we could handle either a redirect or a user code? Let’s say, for instance, that we can hand the user a code they can type in, or we can get them to scan a barcode on a secondary device and be sent to an arbitrary page. To handle that, we simply say we can do&nbsp;both.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "user_code": true<br>    }<br>} <p>Notice that our client expects the user to complete the request on a separate device, and so we don’t have the callback parameter included. The AS can decide whether that’s good enough for what’s being asked, or not. An important difference between these protocols is that OAuth 2 starts with a redirect, while XYZ allows the redirect only after the initial back-channel request. This means we can mix things together in novel ways. For example, we could say that we expect the user to enter a code at a fixed URL, but we do want the user to come back to a callback webpage so that our client can continue.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "callback": {<br>            "uri": "https://client.foo",<br>            "nonce": "VJLO6A4CAYLBXHTR0KRO"<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>What kind of client would ever need to do this? Maybe we’ve got a smart client on device that has ties to a push notification service with a web-based component, or there’s some other deployment structure that we haven’t thought up yet. Componentizing how the user gets to the AS separately from how the user gets back allows us to mix, match, and stack capabilities as appropriate for our use&nbsp;case.</p><p>This setup means we can start to think about other ways to get the user back and securing that return, as well. We need to consider capabilities like sending a response to the client application directly through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push">HTTP/2 Server Push</a>, or a client being notified through some other signaling mechanism.</p> Moving Off the&nbsp;Web <p>Even more importantly, we need to consider interactions with the user outside of the web entirely. While XYZ’s back channel is defined completely over HTTP calls, it doesn’t have to use the front channel (redirects) to interact with the user at all. Here is where the capability-based interaction mechanism starts to get really powerful.</p><p>What if the client indicates that it can do a webauthn style signature? The server can offer its challenge to be signed in the initial response, and the client can sign it (by prompting the user to activate their key) and return the results in the follow-up request. If it’s a key the AS already knows, and there isn’t any consent to be gathered, the user doesn’t need to be redirected anywhere.</p><p>Or what if the client has access to a digital agent with ties to a non-web distributed data store, like a blockchain or other graph-based data fabric? The client can indicate that it can send and receive messages to this agent, or field queries through it. The agent and the AS might be part of the same data fabric, and therefore not need to go through the client in order to communicate. Such a system could even gather and manage consent entirely outside of a web-based protocol. All the XYZ client would need to care about is how to kick off the transaction and how to get the&nbsp;results.</p><p>Or what if the client wants to prompt the user directly for their credentials (cringe)? It’s generally considered bad security practice, but the UX of a login experience that stays completely native to the application is compelling, even today. Be defining an interaction mode specifically for this, the AS can help manage things in a more secure fashion than the OAuth 2 Resource Owner Password Grant. It could allow some kind of clever presentation of the shared secret without exposing it directly, and it could even account for different kinds of&nbsp;MFA.</p><p>Or what if the AS can interact with the user through a native application? The client should be able to indicate it can support that without pretending it’s an HTTP redirect.</p><p>And if a client could do many different things, then it can set them up in the initial request and let the AS decide what is allowed according to its own policies. We should be able to prompt for a security token and call an on-device agent and redirect out to a webpage if that’s not enough. Since the client doesn’t need to pick a single method ahead of time, it doesn’t even need to discover what is possible in order for it to work. This type of engineering at the protocol level greatly enhances interoperability while simplifying code paths for both client and&nbsp;server.</p><p>And finally, what if we don’t need to interact most of the time? OAuth 2 forces the client to try interaction first, but if the AS knows who the client is and who the user is, then it could decide to grant access without ever doing an explicit interaction. We can even do a bootstrapping of complex protocols, such as allowing the client to present an assertion to represent the user but still allowing the AS to interact through a web page (or some other mechanism) if necessary. The user gets involved only when they need&nbsp;to.</p><p>Interaction is one of the core extensibility points of XYZ and one of the key places where it breaks from OAuth 2’s past assumptions. The possibilities are nearly endless, and I believe we’re going to see some really exciting advancements in this&nbsp;space.</p>

<p>As reflected in the juxtaposition of images above, the extended #StayAtHome has caused many to conclude they #DontFeelAtHome where they live so they’re ready to explore transitioning to a better place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Sci-Fi or StarTrek fans, that might inspire fantasies of being beamed up to galaxy far away; for others who feel castaway or lost at sea, sending a message in a bottle might bring hope of finding others who share their dreams, but for fellow change agents, the pandemic has been a <a href="https://twitter.com/RealEstateCafe/status/1267914268269326336?s=20">portal to see what’s wrong with society</a> and a desire to collaborate with others to cocreate a real estate ecosystem to serve the future we want to build together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the last week of the original <a href="https://www.presencing.org/gaia">#GAIAjourney</a> but as founder Otto Scharmer writes, Friday’s zoom session is “grounding ourselves to move forward.”&nbsp; Want to join our Hub or invite others to do the same using the URL below?</p>

<p>Right now, we’re a tiny group but like the lyrics of Sting’s classic hit <a href="https://youtu.be/MbXWrmQW-OE">Message in a Bottle</a>, we know there are millions of people eager to transition to a better place, both for themselves and society.  </p>



<p>Our hope is that Sting’s lyrics fit the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=125990492413880&amp;set=a.102504544762475">image</a> above:</p>

<p>How do I know that you, the data collector/medical researcher/public health system,
will indeed do what you promised? (About privacy, data retention, anonymization, sharing etc)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the answer, as always, is “good governance”, followed by a bunch of hand waving: just what exactly
does this mean? What is that thing called “good governance” of a system that includes a lot of technology
and a lot of humans developing and operating that technology? Take a COVID-19 contact tracing app: there’s
the code, and the release process, and the data sharing, and the employment agreements of people who
touch the code or the data that hopefully will oblige them not do “bad things” and the legal enforcement
and the audit trails and what have you. It’s not simple, and goes far beyond just “the code”.</p>
<p>First of all we have few examples where good governance is actually practiced. So we are not used to it.
Worse, we have nothing resembling agreement on what that actually means, in detail. Just my
example enumeration above is woefully lacking in detail.</p>
<p>It occurs to me it’s a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source licensing</a> of code was
about 20+ years ago, with everybody having their own software license (or none at all), many of which
were homegrown and not very professional. Fortunately, the open-source world has since coalesced around
a fairly small number of primary open-source licenses (like GPL, AGPL, Apache, MIT and a few more),
which are fairly well understood.</p>
<p>We need the same thing for technology governance: a bunch of governance templates, which can be
used by technology systems. They could, for example, include open-source licensing for their code
component (but they don’t necessarily need to), but need to go far beyond, including questions such as:</p>
 
 What is the data retention period? 
 What’s the process to make sure the data is deleted after the data retention period? 
 How do we find out whether the process is or isn’t being followed? 
 
<p>… and many other related questions. If we had such a series of templates, innovation in governance
was still possible (just create another template) but we could collectively understand what
governance looks like for a given system, and, for example, fix governance problems one bug
at a time. Something not possible at all today.</p>
<p>It would go a long way towards us all regaining trust in technology. By public health systems pushing
COVID apps just as much as Facebook pushing the latest “trust us, we won’t spy on you” update.</p>
<p>Anybody working on anything like that? Would love to hear about it.</p>

One of the first and most important decisions I made was to not be backwards compatible with OAuth&nbsp;2.</p><p>This is a bold choice: OAuth 2 is absolutely everywhere, and deliberately breaking with it will put any new protocol at a distinct deployment disadvantage. However, I think that the advantages in the flexibility, especially in the models, are worth it. There are a ton of use cases that don’t fit well into the OAuth 2 world, and even though many of these square pegs have been crammed into the round hole, we can do better than that by taking a step back and designing something new.</p> Working With the&nbsp;Legacy <p>For people in these new use cases, this is a great opportunity. But what about everyone out there who already has OAuth 2 systems and wants to also support something new? XYZ doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and so as a solution it needs to take OAuth 2 developers into account in its design even while addressing the new&nbsp;world.</p><p>To do that, we’ve taken a page from how some of the most successful backwards compatible efforts in the past have worked. Let’s look at Ninendo’s Wii console. When it was introduced, one of its most compelling features was a radically new control scheme. This had features like wireless connections, IR-based pointers, switchable accessories, motion sensitivity, and even a built-in speaker. It was unlike anything else out there, and it was a particularly radical departure from Nintendo’s previous generation game console, the GameCube. Nintendo wanted to encourage existing GameCube owners to come along to the new system, not just by making the new features compelling on their own right (since without that, why move away from the GameCube?) but also by adding ports to allow GameCube games and hardware to be used with the new system. If you had GameCube stuff, there was a place you could plug it in. It was on the side/top of the console and hidden under a flap, but it’s there if you wanted to use&nbsp;it.</p>The ports are there, just hidden. Image from <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Gamecube-Games-on-Wii">https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Gamecube-Games-on-Wii</a><p>Now if you wanted to play a Wii game, you needed to use the Wii controllers and hardware. And if you wanted to play a GameCube game, you could always just buy a GameCube. But what if you were interested in doing both, but didn’t want to have two systems sitting under your TV? This model of focusing on the new but allowing the old to be plugged in is a powerful one, and it was wildly successful.</p> Plugging OAuth 2 Into&nbsp;XYZ <p>XYZ’s core model is pretty different from OAuth 2. XYZ doesn’t have client IDs as part of the protocol, nor does it have scopes. Instead, clients are identified by their keys, and resources have a rich request language to describe them in multiple dimensions. You can even request multiple access tokens simultaneously. All of these are great for use cases like ephemeral and native clients, or rich APIs, but what about something where OAuth 2 already works&nbsp;ok?</p><p>Just like with the Wii, we’ve made sure that there’s a place to plug in things. In fact, this is one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">key features that polymorphic JSON brings to the party</a>. Let’s say you’ve got an OAuth 2 client that has been assigned the client ID client1 and it asks for scopes foo and bar at its AS. This is pretty easy for a developer to plug in to the authorization endpoint (ignoring other optional parameters):</p> client_id=client1&amp;scope=foo%20bar <p>Since we don’t have explicit client identifiers or scopes in XYZ, what are we supposed to do with these values? To understand that, we first need to take a step back and think about what these items each mean in the context of the overall protocol.</p><p>The client_id in OAuth 2 identifies the client, which should be no surprise. But why do we need to identify the client? For one, we want to make sure that when the client authenticates, it does so using the appropriate set of credentials. Since the browser is untrusted for handling shared secrets, we can’t pass those credentials in the front channel where OAuth 2 starts and we need a separate identifier. If we start in the back channel, we don’t need an identifier separate from the credential. But more fundamentally, what does it mean to identify the client at all? The AS is going to want to know which client is asking so that it can apply the appropriate policies, including gathering consent from the user, and these policies drive the rest of the decision process. We can make that same set of decisions without a separate identifier and using the credential directly. XYZ allows us to send the credential by value, but it also allows us to send a reference to that credential instead of the value. In this way, we can use our existing client_id to tell the AS which key we’re using to protect the requests by passing it in as the key handle for the request, in lieu of the key itself. The AS can associate the key, and therefore the policies, by looking up the&nbsp;handle.</p><p>The scope of OAuth 2 follows a similar journey. A resource in XYZ is described by a multi-dimensional and potentially complex object, with actions, locations, datatypes, and any number of API-specific components to it. But just like the client_id, we need to ask ourselves what does the scope represent in OAuth 2? Functionally, it’s a shortcut asking for a particular slice of an API, defined by the API. So in other words, it’s a predefined combination of actions, locations, datatypes, and any number of other API-specific components — it is a shorthand to a concept analogous to one of the resource request objects in XYZ. Which means, of course, that we can use a resource handle to represent that predefined object.</p><p>What this means is that our client developer has a place in the protocol to plug in the values that they already have. They don’t plug into the same place, and they don’t go through quite the same circuitry, but they’re there, and they&nbsp;work.</p> {<br>    "keys": "client1",<br>    "resources": [<br>        "foo",<br>        "bar"<br>    ]<br>} <p>But here’s something really cool about this: once we’re plugging in our values into the new protocol, then we can start to use the new features alongside the old ones. Since we have the new system, we can play both the new games as well as the old games. That means that our client could, for example, ask for an additional detailed resource alongside its tried and true&nbsp;scopes.</p> {<br>    "keys": "client1",<br>    "resources": [<br>        "foo",<br>        "bar",<br>        {<br>             "actions": ["read", "write"],<br>             "datatypes": ["accounts", "history"]<br>        }<br>} <p>All of this is done without putting a burden on new apps to use any of these legacy mechanisms. Ephemeral apps don’t have to pretend to get a client ID, and resource servers don’t have to wrap their APIs into simple scope values. Those functions are there for the cases where they make sense and stay out of the way when they&nbsp;don’t.</p> Staying With OAuth&nbsp;2 <p>But what if you don’t want all the new features at all? What if you’re totally fine with OAuth 2 as it is today, or as it will be in a year with all of its extensions? In those cases, just keep using it. No, really. If it’s a good solution, you should keep using it, even if something fancier is on the horizon. OAuth 2 is a good solution for a lot of things, and we’ll continue seeing it for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>OAuth 2’s got a lot of great extensions that let it do a lot of different things, including things like PAR and RAR that start to approach a very different protocol that’s closer to XYZ than classical OAuth 2. However, these extensions have to live in the world of OAuth 2, and the fit isn’t always that great. But for many developers, the cost of smushing these new functionalities in to their existing system might be less than the cost of switching to a new system, and that’s a fine and reasonable approach.</p><p>But for the rest of the world, those who aren’t using OAuth 2 because it’s not a good fit or want OAuth 2 but a bit more than what it offers, then it’s a good time to move forward in a clear and deliberate way.</p>

 Monitoring WSO2 Identity Server Health with Prometheus/Grafana <p>Monitoring the health of your application is something we must have in a production system to make sure that the application is running without any issues. In addition, monitoring may be required in performance testing, capacity planning, etc as well in the pre-production environments to see who well the application perform under different conditions.</p><p>WSO2 Identity Server is an IAM server which is running on a JVM. There are multiple ways where you can monitor the health of a JVM application which can be used with Identity Server as well. In this post, we’ll see how to do that with Prometheus and&nbsp;Grafana.</p> Adding the Prometheus JMX&nbsp;exporter <p>Prometheus is a pull-based monitoring application. It provides different tools and clients to extract the data out of different applications. One such tool is the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter">JMX exporter</a>. Let’s see how we can add this exporter to Identity Server so that It can make the Identity Server JVM matrices available to Prometheus.</p><p>First, create a config file to be used by the JMX exporter at &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin as is.yml and add the following in that&nbsp;file.</p> lowercaseOutputLabelNames: true<br>lowercaseOutputName: true<br>whitelistObjectNames: ["java.lang:type=OperatingSystem"]<br>blacklistObjectNames: []<br>rules:<br>  - pattern: 'java.lang&lt;type=OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;&gt;(committed_virtual_memory|free_physical_memory|free_swap_space|total_physical_memory|total_swap_space)_size:'<br>    name: os_$1_bytes<br>    type: GAUGE<br>    attrNameSnakeCase: true<br>  - pattern: 'java.lang&lt;type=OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;&gt;((?!process_cpu_time)\w+):'<br>    name: os_$1<br>    type: GAUGE<br>    attrNameSnakeCase: true <p>Then get the latest release version Prometheus JMX exporter from <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/releases">here</a>. You may also need to build it to get the binary. Place that binary in the &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/.</p><p>Now, open the &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/wso2server.sh file (or the&nbsp;.bat file for windows), and scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following as a parameter,</p> -javaagent:$CARBON_HOME/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.13.0.jar=8880:$CARBON_HOME/bin/is.yml \ <p>Note that I’m using the 0.13.0 version of the agent here which I took at the previous step. If it is different please update accordingly.</p><p>Also, note that I’m using 8880 port to export the metrics. You may change this port also if required.</p><p>The &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/wso2server.sh file should look like below with the other parameters</p>     ....<br>    -Dhttpclient.hostnameVerifier="DefaultAndLocalhost" \<br>    -Dorg.apache.xml.security.ignoreLineBreaks=false \<br>    -javaagent:$CARBON_HOME/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.13.0.jar=8880:$CARBON_HOME/bin/is.yml \<br>    org.wso2.carbon.bootstrap.Bootstrap $*<br>    .... <p>Start the Identity&nbsp;Server.</p><p>You can verify the exporter is properly configured by accessing <a href="http://localhost:8880/metrics">http://localhost:8880/metrics</a> (Use the same port you configured in the&nbsp;.sh&nbsp;file)</p> Configuring Prometheus to Pull&nbsp;Data <p>Now at Prometheus, we need to pull the data from Identity Server. To do that create a file named is.yml at PROMETHEUS_HOME. And add the following configs&nbsp;there,</p> global:<br>  scrape_interval:     15s <br>  evaluation_interval: 15s   # Alertmanager configuration<br>alerting:<br>  alertmanagers:<br>  - static_configs:<br>    - targets:<br>      # - alertmanager:9093  # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.<br>rule_files:  # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:<br>scrape_configs:<br>  - job_name: 'WSO2 Identity Server'  static_configs:<br>    - targets: ['localhost:8880'] <p>Note that as targets we gave the hostname and port of the endpoint where Identity Server was exporting the metrics. By default, the context path will be assumed as /metrics. So we won’t need to explicitly configure it&nbsp;here.</p><p>Now start the Prometheus server&nbsp;as</p> ./prometheus --config.file=is.yml <p>The Prometheus server will start at <a href="http://localhost:9090/">http://localhost:9090/</a></p><p>Go to Status -&gt; Targets from the main menu, and see If the Identity Server is properly configured. You should see something as below if all are&nbsp;correct.</p><p>At Prometheus, we can run different queries and see some basic graphs. But I’ll skip that as we can get a lot better graphs with&nbsp;Grafana.</p> Configuring Grafana <p>Download and extract Grafana, and start it by running&nbsp;./grafana-server from GRAFANA_HOME/bin.</p><p>Grafana will start on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. Use the default credentials (admin:admin) to log in (and make sure you change them&nbsp;later)</p><p>At Grafana, first we need to add Prometheus as a datasource for Grafana. To do that, go to Configuration -&gt; Data Sources from the left navigation as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Click add and select ‘Prometheus’ as the type of the data source and provide the connection details as&nbsp;below,</p><p>Now we need to create dashboards from the data we retrieve from Prometheus. Well, we don’t need to create them from scratch. Instead, we can reuse an already available dashboard by importing it. There are few dashboards already available for JVM metrics. Out of them, I prefer the one at <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8563">https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8563</a>. So, Let’s use it&nbsp;here.</p><p>In Grafana, hover over the ‘+’ icon on the left menu and click ‘Import’. And under ‘Import via grafana.com’ give the Id of the above mentioned dashboard which is 8563 and click&nbsp;‘load’.</p><p>On the next page give the ‘Job’ as ‘WSO2 Identity Server’ (which is the job name we gave at Prometheus), and click&nbsp;Import.</p><p>Now you’ll see a nice dashboard with all the health data from the Identity Server. It will&nbsp;include,</p>  Server status (Up/Down)  Uptime  CPU usage  Memory Usage  GC details  Threads  Classloading  <p>Following are some screenshots from my local server (which was mostly idling&nbsp;:))</p>Server status/uptime/CPU UsageMemory usage/GC&nbsp;timeThreads/ Classloading/Physical Memory<p>That’s it! Happy monitoring!</p><p>PS. I was also interested in getting the Identity data also here (like Login details, User signups, etc). And I made some good progress with that. I will cover those in a separate blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>References:</p><p><a href="https://madurangasblogs.blogspot.com/2019/02/monitoring-wso2-identity-server-with.html">https://madurangasblogs.blogspot.com/2019/02/monitoring-wso2-identity-server-with.html</a></p>
