<p>Besides generic session authentication, there is an increasing need to gather explicit user consent for a specific action, i.e. “Transaction Confirmation”. Transaction Confirmation allows a relying party to not only determine if a user is involved in a transaction, but also confirm that the transaction is what the user actually intended – for example, whether they intended to pay $1000 to company X for purchasing product Y, or whether they consent to have specific data shared with another party, such as test results with a doctor.</p>



<p>This paper provides an overview on Transaction Confirmation and the drivers for its support including: regulatory requirements (PSD2, eIDAS); addressing friendly and mobile fraud; and to enable online binding agreements. It explains current approaches for Transaction Confirmation, including through FIDO protocols for native applications, and the value of adding support for it directly in web browsers. It concludes with a call for feedback from relying parties on whether they would like to see Transaction Confirmation should be supported directly in web browsers.</p>

<p>This is the third piece in a four-part series on nationalism and its threat to digital identity. If you missed it, read parts <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/data-privacy-human-rights-insights-by-one-world-identity/">one</a> and <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/chinas-digital-identity-schema-propels-nationalist-tech-ambitions/">two</a> now for the most comprehensive insights.</p>



<p>To recap: on July 7th, the EU announced that it had revoked the <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ecj-invalidated-the-eu-us-privacy-71770/">Privacy Shield</a>, a transatlantic agreement that enabled the legal transfer of data between itself and the United States (U.S.). Remarkably, the invalidation of the Privacy Shield framework was made effective immediately, leaving no grace period for an estimated <a href="https://fpf.org/2020/07/14/new-fpf-study-more-than-250-european-companies-are-participating-in-key-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">5,400 companies</a> that rely on the program’s protections to transfer data to and from the EU. Compounding the ambiguity of the moment is the flurry of complaints filed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints/">European privacy groups</a> against major companies with regional operators still relying on Google Analytics / Facebook Connect integrations (still reliant on Privacy Shield-adjacent arrangements).&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The present moment might be ostensibly described as another dip on the regulatory rollercoaster at the heart of the EU’s mandate for individual privacy. The announcement a few days ago that the European Commission has begun initiating discussions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/eu-us-privacy-shield-is-dead-long-live-privacy-shield/">construct a new Privacy Shield</a> seems to encapsulate such imagery. It mirrors how the same court responsible struck down a similar decades-long data agreement in 2015, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/europes-highest-court-strikes-down-safe-harbour-data-sharing-between-eu-and-us/">Safe Harbour agreement</a>, propelling the European Commission to propose and enact the Privacy Shield in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we should recognize the past few years as indicative of the EU’s growing willingness to play privacy “bully-ball”, pressuring other countries — including close allies — to comply with stronger data privacy mandates as a basic requirement to conduct business in the region. Indeed, the EU is making a nationalist digital identity play, focused on addressing the control over <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/identity-building-blocks/">identity’s building blocks</a> at a regional level.</p>



<p>The EU’s prioritization of individual privacy is best understood as a cocktail of two countervailing forces – one part historical concerns that the union has had with overbroad government interests, and one part overbroad commercial interests. For the past three decades, the EU has always had a comprehensive, region-spanning privacy framework — first with the Data Protection Directive (DPD), transposed consequently by the <a href="https://gdpr.report/news/2018/03/06/data-protection-directive-versus-gdpr-understanding-key-changes/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> in 2018 (GDPR). The two equally address protection against government and industry forces, applying to all organizations in the EU operating in the public and private sector. In contrast, the US has consistently been plagued by a patchwork approach. Its <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44257.pdf">legal precedent</a> has largely focused on governmental intrusions on individual privacy, and its commercial protections are industry-specific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU also has had a vested interest in pushing back against Silicon Valley (SV) incumbents, reflecting its issues with the US regulatory approach to privacy. Moreover, this interest is couched in the historical and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-siliconvalley/strong-ties-bind-spy-agencies-and-silicon-valley-idUSBRE96214I20130703">silent cooperation</a> of SV corporations <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-reddit-idUSKCN0WX2YF">with</a> US intelligence agencies. In fact, it was the 2013 revelations about the scope and breadth of the US National Surveillance Agency, laid bare by Snowden, which prompted the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44257.pdf">original scrutiny in the EU leading to the 2015 Safe Harbor agreement strikedown</a>. Previous actions the EU has taken also reflect this, with the EU <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/eu-ups-antitrust-pressure-on-google-cites-nsa-scandal-android-domination-as-a-factor/">citing potential NSA involvement</a> in 2018 as it applied antitrust pressure against Google.</p>



<p>Although the EU is focused primarily on individual privacy — whereas China has focused on national security as its guiding principle — its strong preference for data localization suggests a similar belief that strong government actions and regulations can also play a part in re-establishing the EU as a power in the digital identity space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU’s commercial ambitions for digital identity are made chiefly evident by viewing its government initiatives in the context of anti-SV and anti-US regulatory trends. Its Data Strategy, announced in February 2020, will set into motion a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/building-european-data-economy">€2 billion investment </a>into EU specific data processing and sharing infrastructure. Moreover, in April 2020, the union announced <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/eu-data-market-technology-silicon-valley">plans</a> to stand up a region-specific industrial database that could rival SV, aiming to capitalize on a EU-centric data economy worth roughly <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-data-market-study-update">400 billion euros</a> and a data market worth roughly 75 billion euros.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s clear that, at least when it comes to digital identity, the EU has furthered its national interest and led the narrative around who controls and shapes it. And while the impact to its data economy has yet to be captured fully, the EU has succeeded in establishing itself as a regulatory leader for data privacy. It has pushed other countries (notably, <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/argentinas-new-bill-on-personal-data-protection/">Argentina</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en">Japan</a>) to achieve adequacy for data protection within the region.&nbsp;<br>In doing so, the EU has legitimized the phantom of cyber-nationalism sweeping the globe, and suggests its investment in leading and molding digital identity for both its citizens and — by proxy — the rest of the world. The EU Commission’s Data Strategy states this plainly, emphasizing that the moment to act against “sources of competitiveness for the next decades in the data economy” (i.e. SV incumbents) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">is now</a>. Acting otherwise, it states, “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">reduces incentives</a>” for data-driven businesses located in the region to emerge, to grow, and to compete.</p>

<p>Members of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance are united in the belief that identity is a fundamental and universal human right and that we all deserve better ways to prove who we are — both in the physical world and&nbsp;online.</p><p>As a community of technologists, advocates, implementers, and funders, we also believe that ethically implemented, privacy-protecting, user-managed, and portable digital ID solutions offer a better alternative to the current “data as a commodity” paradigm.</p><p>A new report from KPMG entitled, <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2020/new-imperative-corporate-data-responsibility.html">The New Imperative for Corporate Data Responsibility</a>, suggests that the American public increasingly agrees with this perspective. Based on a survey of 1,000 respondents, the report concludes that consumers expect corporations to “take significant steps to better protect, manage, and ethically use their&nbsp;data.”</p><blockquote>“The findings are unmistakable,” says Orson Lucas, Principal, KPMG Cyber Security Services. “Data privacy and protection are clear priorities for consumers. Close attention to customer data handling, management, and protection practices are key, foundational elements of establishing and maintaining digital&nbsp;trust.”</blockquote><p>The report outlines valuable findings regarding how the public feels about the security of their data, the issues that concern them, and who they believe bears responsibility for creating a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key Findings: Beliefs</p>  97 percent of respondents say that data privacy is important to&nbsp;them  87 percent believe that data privacy is a human&nbsp;right  86 percent believe that data privacy is a growing&nbsp;concern  68 percent don’t trust companies to ethically sell their private&nbsp;data  54 percent don’t trust companies to use their personal data in an ethical&nbsp;way  53 percent don’t trust companies to collect data in an ethical&nbsp;way  50 percent don’t trust companies to protect their personal&nbsp;data  <p>These insights should not surprise us. After all, a majority of Americans have, at one time or another, been personally affected by a data breach. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see that public opinion is shifting; our experiences have made us all more cognizant of how our identity and personal data are being misused and mismanaged. On the other hand, these experiences are also contributing to a growing mistrust of all forms of digital ID. For those who work in this space, this is a timely reminder that, as we develop and deploy new forms of digital ID, we must do so with an intentional focus and abiding commitment to rebuild and maintain public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Key Findings: Concerns</p>  83 percent of respondents worry most about the theft of their Social Security Number, followed by their credit card number (69 percent), and their passwords (49&nbsp;percent)  Only 16 percent are worried about their medical records being stolen. Medical records are the most commonly cited example of data that consumers trust companies to protect (57&nbsp;percent)  <p>Given these rapidly changing consumer opinions, and with our vision of good digital ID for all as our guiding star, we at ID2020 regularly revisit the question: how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The data suggest what we have long believed: that, in the coming years, market forces (i.e. consumer demands) will drive tectonic shifts in the data economy. But will market forces be&nbsp;enough?</p><p>Most telling in the data is that the public is most likely to trust healthcare companies to protect the privacy of their medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establish robust data protections and stiff penalties for companies that mishandle data. These offer the public a degree of confidence that their health information will be held sacrosanct.</p><p>The house is on fire and that the public is finally smelling the smoke when it comes to data security. Market forces can be extremely powerful, but we expect that governments will play an equally important, catalytic role by establishing the regulatory frameworks and consumer protections necessary to rebuild trust and encourage the broad adoption of safe and secure digital ID applications.</p><p>Here as well, the KPMG data provides some valuable insights for policymakers.</p><p>Key Findings: Who is Responsible</p>  91 percent of respondents say that corporations should take the lead in establishing corporate data responsibility  56 percent say that companies should prioritize giving consumers more control over their data in&nbsp;2020  84 percent are open to state legislatures giving consumers more control over their&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Data privacy issues are not going to go away,” says KPMG Cyber Security Services Principle, Steve Stein. “In fact, consumer protections around data privacy, like the ones provided by the CCPA, are very likely to be codified in other states and eventually at the federal level. Simply put, privacy laws are only going to increase in volume and rigor. That’s why visibility, protection, and trust is gaining such momentum in the marketplace and also why leading-edge companies are not looking at data privacy as just another compliance or check-the-box exercise. They see privacy as one of the pathways to growing their business by improving trust with their customers.”</blockquote><p>So…How DO We Get&nbsp;There?</p><p>Identity systems rely on trust to function; trust between issuers of identity and relying parties and, critically, that of those who use the system to prove their identity to access various goods, services, and privileges.</p><p>ID2020 was established in 2016 to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions. To achieve this vision, we are working simultaneously along three&nbsp;tracks.</p><p>We are helping shape the market through the ID2020 Certification, which applies 41 rigorous, outcome-based Technical Requirements to certify best-in-class digital ID solutions. We are working with policymakers in the United States and internationally to advocate for the ethical implementation of better forms of digital ID. And, as the technologies continue to evolve, we are implementing programs in the field to test and apply what we learn as these systems are replicated and brought to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Fully realizing the potential of digital ID will require businesses, technology providers, policymakers, and civil society to collaborate — and quickly — to build and implement functional, privacy-preserving, user-managed ID systems, and work to overcome the mistrust which could impede their broad adoption. We developed the ID2020 Alliance model to foster this collaboration.</p><p>The road to good ID for all is riddled with potholes…and we have one chance to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/new-report-highlights-public-concerns-about-data-privacy-6cfd1e248d49">New Report Highlights Public Concerns About Data Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We all have heard blockchain stories. Stories that redefined the way businesses operate. Stories that created new business across the domains. Stories that propelled innovation. Stories that are defining the future of technology. Stories that helped others run their business in decentralized fashion. And a lot more.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has seen increasingly wider adoption across the industries. Digital transformation of businesses and innovation in the healthcare industry have seen unprecedented demand like never before during the challenging times of COVID-19. What seemed impossible in the past is now turning to be reality.</p>



<p>The Hyperledger India Chapter aims to bridge the gap between the blockchain technology enthusiasts and the blockchain technology experts. To us, it seemed it was time for an event to bring together booming startups and established organizations to share their blockchain journey. In these demanding times, having physical get-togethers is impossible around the world. There is a saying in Sanskrit “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” which translates to “World is Indeed One Family.” The idea of having the virtual event in India transformed to one that could benefit the whole Asia Pacific audience. The event time was chosen so that everybody in the Asia Pacific region from the Middle East to Australia/New Zealand could attend.</p>



<p>In the last week of May and through June, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hyperledger-india-chapter">Hyperledger India Chapter</a> proudly organized a series of interactive events, the most anticipated “Blockchain Stories 2020.”</p>



<p>The series was an attempt to answer the questions one normally hears. Is blockchain really being adopted across the industries? What uses can blockchain solve? How do you effectively use a blockchain solution? Can blockchain transform agriculture? How does blockchain transform education and certification in the future? Is blockchain an answer to all the healthcare problems? What are the barriers for the adoption of blockchain technology?</p>



<p>Highlights:</p>



  25+ organizations presented their solutions. The topics covered a range of domains including supply chain, telecom, healthcare, agriculture, digitally verifiable certificates, self sovereign identity and security, digital currency, global trade, research and education.&nbsp;  More than 1,000 blockchain enthusiasts from across the Asia Pacific region signed up for the events.  Community engagement continued across five weeks.   20+ volunteers helped tirelessly, physically separated but virtually connected.&nbsp;  



<p>That’s not all. Since Hyperledger believes in inclusive community growth, sessions not only showcased solutions built on Hyperledger projects but also ones built on other platforms. These sessions focused more on how blockchain as a technology pillar is helping to design solutions to the demanding problems. The series also featured talks on how to measure and improve the performance of blockchain frameworks.</p>



<p>Indian blockchain firms have made an impact on Industry 4.0, which created massive hype amongst the young, brilliant and blooming minds of India. Blockchain tech has already made its way into many mainstream industries. The emerging technology startups thanked the Hyperledger India Chapter for organizing an event and providing them an opportunity to present their solution alongside the lights of big establishments. AyanWorks, a blockchain startup based in Pune, India, presented their immunity passport solution for safe reopening of the post pandemic world. Snapper Future Tech &amp; IIT Alumni Association presented their solution on COVID-19 X-Ray analysis using&nbsp; blockchain &amp; AI, reducing the cost of testing. Tech Mahindra showed how blockchain is helping to solve the telecom’s billion subscriber problem, and countries including the USA are requesting a similar solution. The dltledgers, a blockchain startup based in Singapore, shared their digital transformation journey for cross border trade finance. Soramitsu, a blockchain technology firm based in Japan, shared their payment solution.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunsm93/">Arun S M</a>, Walmart Global Tech, says “It feels amazing to see the great response from the community. What started as a thought late last year took multiple turns, shapes and forms to be finally called Blockchain Stories 2020. Hyperledger staff members made it easy for us to turn a local event into a virtual one that reached an audience throughout Asia Pacific. The community stood by us through a technical glitch on our first day of the event, showing quality and a high level of interest and engagement.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-gordon-12a2a3/">Julian Gordon</a>, VP, Asia Pacific, Hyperledger, says “Hyperledger’s India Chapter volunteers worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to produce this wonderful series of ‘Blockchain Stories 2020’ for the Hyperledger and wider blockchain communities. Each event featured cutting-edge blockchain solutions, addressed opportunities and challenges, and showcased exciting developments in blockchain. Hyperledger has received excellent and appreciative feedback from the series’ virtual audience. It’s particularly timely and heartening to see quality virtual events like these take place in this challenging time of Covid-19. It’s a pleasure to support Hyperledger’s India Chapter, and I would like to thank them for all their work on the ‘Blockchain Stories 2020’ series.”</p>



<p>Did you miss the event? We have got it covered. Watch the recap <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CEOZ2WrkVuAfSKtzNwsyDk5">on YouTube</a>. The Hyperledger India Chapter thanks all the volunteers and organizers for helping to make this event a success story.</p>



<p>About Us: The Hyperledger India Chapter is responsible for growing the Hyperledger community in India, promoting contributions to Hyperledger projects and providing a platform for collaboration, mentoring and support. The chapter aims to showcase the broad range of Hyperledger projects and initiatives to the Indian audience. Join us and share your ideas! Weekly meeting details can be found at the Hyperledger <a href="http://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings">Calendar of Public Meetings</a>.</p>



<p>Future Plans: There is a huge interest in the community to contribute back to open source projects. We are happy to provide a platform and connect, guide and mentor the technical community in India. Following the success of the “Blockchain Stories 2020,” we will organize a “Hyperledger Project Connect Series” to benefit tech enthusiasts in Africa, Europe and the Asia Pacific regions.</p>

<p>An Overview of Introductory Resources (August&nbsp;2020)</p><p>[Note: this article is also available as a downloadable <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/where-to-begin-aug2020.pdf">PDF</a>.]</p><p>There is no one single (or even central) place where decentralized identity technologies are being created. It is decentralized in its processes as well as its topography. Learning the “lay of the land” entails bouncing around a network more than surveying a city from a high vantage point. But that’s ok! We recommend starting from the least familiar of these links and bouncing around, rather than reading start to&nbsp;finish.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@benjaminjohnelliott">Benjamin&nbsp;Elliot</a> —Video Introductions to&nbsp;SSI   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djhYZZ3CkuM">An Introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> 9min<br>This presentation by the “SSI Ambassador” (Adrian Doerk of the LISSI project, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany) touches on the psychology and sociology of identity definitions. It highlights why digital identity offers many different ways to present ourselves and walks through the basics of how ID today is dominated by mega-IdPs (identity providers). It gets to the conceptual heart of what SSI is about. It also shows a real live demonstration of a scooter-authorization project spearheaded by T-Mobile&nbsp;Germany.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GkdBRmsbE&amp;t=9s">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Foam Figure Explainer v2</a> 9min<br>John Phillips from 460 Degrees, a consulting firm from Sydney, AU, updated his earlier video in January of 2020. This level-setting and first-introduction was designed to help Phillips’ clients understand what SSI looks like from a business-process perspective, which is the key perspective from which large enterprises are mostly likely to decide how much to invest in researching and considering SSI solutions. For more guidance on B2B sales and education, see his longer <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/explaining-ssi-c-suite-executives-anyone-else-john-phillips-webinar-48/">February presentation</a> at SSI Meetup about how to explain SSI to C-Level executives.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydQmOTcECk">The True Meaning of Identity </a>38 min<br>In September 2019, Kaliya Young presented to SIBOS (the conference of the SWIFT settlement network central to global banking) in their Innovation Track. The video introduces the concept of identity and how it has evolved over time, before sharing at a high level how Self-Sovereign Identity works and why it solves widespread business problems.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfi11GZjbWM">Domains of Identity</a> — 33 min<br>In July of 2018, Kaliya Young presented to the MyData Conference and tied together her research work developing the <a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-hb">Domains of Identity</a> and how the various domains connects to the usage of decentralized identity technology — decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials.  <p>The <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSIMeetup</a> series run out of Madrid, Spain by the indefatigable Alex Preukchat has been assembling a video archive of their live webinar series for years. For these, they invite leaders of influential projects from around the world working on SSI projects. They have a loyal following of regular attendees, making for a spirited Q&amp;A session at the end of each video. While most of the videos tend towards deep dives in specific technical, governance, business, or regional topics, some of them can be useful, accessible, and inspiring for novices. Here are a few we recommend in particular as “novice-friendlier deep&nbsp;dives”:</p>  At the Core of SSI is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcfy9wd5bZI">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> 50min by Drummond&nbsp;Reed  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-explained-cios-steve-manning-webinar-44/">CIO Brief: Why SSI is Important</a> 65min by Steve&nbsp;Magennis  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/hyperledger-aries-open-source-interoperable-identity-solutions-nathan-george-webinar-30/">Introduction to Hyperledger Aries</a> 71min by Nathan&nbsp;George  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/sovereignty-historical-context-self-sovereign-identity-natalie-smolenski-webinar-18/">Sovereignty in Historical Context</a> 55min by Natalie Smolenski  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-healthcare-dr-manreet-nijjar-webinar-21/">SSI In Healthcare</a> 63min by Manreet&nbsp;Nijjar   — Organizational Centers of Gravity in&nbsp;SSI  <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (you are&nbsp;here) <p>This organization was formed as a Joint Development Foundation project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out non-technical cooperation for market-building and promotion of the shared technology.</p> <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">The W3C Credentials Community Group</a> <p>This public discussion group is affiliated with the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), a standards organization for web technologies supported by membership dues and responsible for the management of core protocols like HTML and TLS. The Credential Community Group (CCG) is not an official working group of the W3C, but is still protected under a version of W3C’s IPR regime. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/community/work_items.html">Work items</a> can be proposed by W3C non-members, and these often include specifications that go on to be standardized. CCG meets every week and is a hub for coordinating activity. Their meetings are recorded and minuted, often including <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/presentations/">presentations</a>. They also have coordinate other discussion groups open to non-members, such as the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">Education Credentials Task Force</a> (“vc-ed”).</p> <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">The Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a> <p>This biannual event has been the convening at the heart of the decentralized identity community for 15 years, held at the Computer History Museum in the heart of Silicon Valley. It is uniquely co-created by its participants in a mostly-organic and community-driven way, with no pre-picked speakers, keynotes, or commercial presentations aside from a demo hour. True to its name, workshopping, whiteboarding, and open (but detailed and concrete!) discussion on a massive scale are the core of the event. The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">books of proceedings</a> organize and refine all of the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">notes</a> taken live during all the sessions convened at each&nbsp;event.</p> <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> <p>This influential and egalitarian global organization grew out of a series of <a href="https://online2020.mydata.org">conferences</a> first held in 2016. They advocate for a human-centric and rights-driven vision where individuals can get digital services that support them to collect their data, not just safeguarding and well serving but even empowering the data subject. Organizational members and individual members come together to create an ongoing dialogue between “consumers” and ethical businesses to shape new types of markets for digital services. Rooted in the values of the <a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>, they focus primarily on elaborating refined, nuance, and bottoms-up models for data governance; only from a solid governance foundation do they begin to make policy, business, and technology decisions. They recently published the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData Operators paper</a>, bringing their policy, business, and technological goals more squarely into the realm of decentralized identity.</p> Standards organizations <p>These centers of gravity are where ideas and business models evolve in broad conversation. Inevitably, structuring ground rules and governance models for these eventually have to be negotiated between technical experts and standards adopted before major investments (of capital, but also of legislation and public good will) can be approved. See Nader Helmy’s great <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7">tour</a> of standards organizations relevant to these centers of&nbsp;gravity.</p> — Government Initiatives:  United States Federal Government <p>Anil John, head of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program run under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate has been funding the development of standards and business models in the nascent field for years. Their website hosts an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">overview</a> of related projects <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">articles by them</a>, as well as guidance documents such as the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/white-paper/2020/01/14/a-taxonomic-approach-to-understanding-emerging-blockchain-idms/final">Taxonomic Approach</a> to Understanding Emerging Blockchain Identity Management Systems. Anil’s blog hosted by CyberForge includes many thoughtful pieces, such as Anil’s recent thoughts on interoperability or his article on the role of government in free-market technology, <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">Can LESS be&nbsp;more</a>?</p> The British Columbia Provincial Government <p>“BCGov” has invested significantly in the SSI IT management model and has pioneered an approach to verifiable public data represented by the <a href="https://vonx.io">Verifiable Organizations Network</a> (“VON”). This network provides public-record credentials about registered business in a publicly accessible repository of Verifiable Credentials, bringing the traditional “orgBook” into the decentralized era. By directing much of their IT budgets towards open-source development and participating heavily in the emerging open-source community around this project, they have provided invaluable leadership, particularly within the Aries community, including such major contributions as the core of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox">Aca-Py Codebase</a>.</p> The European&nbsp;Union <p>ESSIF (European SSI Framework) is an ongoing open-source initiative to seed and accelerate the role of SSI in the EU digital “single market” strategy. It is housed jointly between the directorate-generals responsible for IT planning and policy in Brussels and the independent European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Get+Started+EBSI">EBSI</a>), a 30-country collaboration of EU and EU-affiliated countries working together to build a shared infrastructure for government blockchain projects. SSI Meetups are the best way to learn more about ESSIF and its role in the EU’s broader digital initiatives:</p>  An <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/understanding-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-essif-daniel-du-seuil-carlos-pastor-webinar-32/">overview</a> by ESSIF Convenors Daniel du Seuil and Carlos Pastor (July&nbsp;2019)  ESSIF Chief Legal Counsel Nacho Alamillo gave an introduction to ESSIF’s approach to eIDAS in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/eidas-regulation-anchoring-trust-self-sovereign-identity-systems-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-49/">February 2020</a> and a more detailed overview of the official report of the legal review based on that approach in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introducing-ssi-eidas-legal-report-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-55/">May of&nbsp;2020</a>  ESSIF-LAB program coordinators Oskar van Deventer and Rieks Joosten (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMVyLARr-4">TNO</a>, the Hague) gave an <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/essif-lab-creating-funding-interoperable-ssi-infrastructure-europe-webinar-52/">overview</a> of how their program incentivizes interoperability and European contributions to the broader SSI landscape (March&nbsp;2020)  Interested parties are encouraged to check the ec.europa.eu website for current <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-identity-and-trust-commission-launches-public-consultation-eidas-regulation">public consultations</a> and calls for&nbsp;comment.

<p>ID2020 is proud to announce the certification of Immunity Passport from BLOK Bioscience, a digital ID-based solution for COVID health status certificates. Immunity Passport is the first COVID-focused solution to be certified by&nbsp;ID2020.</p><p>Immunity Passport offers individuals a self-sovereign record of their testing, antibody and, ultimately, vaccination status. Initially envisioned as a means to help businesses and governments manage the safe and incremental return to public life in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the solution is expected to be applied more broadly in the future to support immunization certificates and the transmission of other medical test&nbsp;results.</p><blockquote>“The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital credentials into the global spotlight,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As we consider digital ID-based solutions for public health applications, getting the technology right is not negotiable. We intentionally set a high bar for certification and are delighted to recognize the BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport solution for meeting our high standards for privacy protection, user-management, portability, and&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><p>To be eligible for certification, solutions must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. In addition to providing a roadmap to help developers create better products, the ID2020 Certification also provides a “third-party seal of approval” so that implementers — and ultimately, end-users — can trust that the technology was developed in accordance with the highest ethical and technical standards.</p><blockquote>“Pandemic management is essentially an entirely new solution domain,” said BLOK Solutions Chief Technology Officer, Areiel Wolanow. “The precedents we set now will set the standard for how the future unfolds, so we have a duty to get things right. By starting with the principle that individuals should always be the sole owner of their data, it is our hope at BLOK that this a standard that others will find it exceedingly difficult to deviate&nbsp;from.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Certification is already impacting the technical landscape for digital ID and technology providers of all sizes are increasingly aligning their technical approaches to comport with ID2020’s requirements. To date, more than 30 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with the ID2020 staff and advisory committees to complete the application process.</p><p>Today, Immunity Passport joins Kiva Protocol, Gravity.earth, and ZAKA as part of a small, but rapidly growing, cadre of ID2020 certified digital ID solutions.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About BLOK BioScience, Ltd.</p><p>BLOK BioScience is part of the BLOK Group.

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">Support for FIDO in browsers and operating systems</a> is widespread and growing fast. Enterprises now have better tools to replace easily compromised passwords with simpler, stronger FIDO Authentication and eliminate phishing, man-in-the-middle and other security attacks. But, if you want to deploy FIDO in your enterprise, what are the first steps? Do you need to explain “why FIDO?” to your CISO? What do the timelines look like? Should you build your own server or work with a vendor? What FIDO authenticators should you accept? How do you manage&nbsp; them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will answer these questions, and more, in its new white paper series. The series aims to educate corporate management and IT security on the improvements available for authentication today and how to leverage them within their own organizations. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging into company systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up in the series is the primer “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">CXO Explanation: Why Use FIDO for Passwordless Employee Logins</a>?” This document is the guide for you and/or the executive leaders in your organization as to why you should invest in FIDO2 deployment for your employees.</p>



<p>It addresses all of the common questions from CXOs on the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. Read it now at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/</a> and pass it along to colleagues.</p>



<p>Subsequent entries in this educational series will focus on server deployment, authenticator choices, authenticator life-cycle management, and credential acceptance in the enterprise. This series is part of the Alliance’s strategy to provide expert deployment guidance to our community in order to support the rapidly growing number of FIDO implementations across a variety of use cases. Please watch this space as we publish more in this Enterprise Series over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of Cambodia in Southeast Asia, three-quarters (78%) of its citizens have no bank account, yet more than half own a smartphone. And even though the native currency—the Khmer riel (KHR)—has been stable for 20 years, most people there use the American dollar. Ever since a major UN mission in the mid-1990s, the price of everything from a cup of coffee to a car has been given in U.S. dollars.</p>



<p>Addressing these challenges and more, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) set out to see if a digital payment system could handle transactions faster and for lower cost than the existing system.</p>



<p>Could it promote wider use of the riel? And could that system run as a mobile app that any citizen with a smartphone could use to shop or transfer money to family or friends?</p>



<p>To find out, NBC partnered with blockchain developer experts Soramitsu on a retail payment system project that would modernize the country’s legacy retail payments with the help of the Hyperledger Iroha blockchain framework.</p>



<p>When most people picture a CBDC, they imagine an entirely new digital asset created out of “thin air.” The problem is, this new asset could distort a country’s monetary policy and affect its exchange rates. To be prudent, Cambodia’s central bank wanted to create a digital token backed by fiat currency stored safely in its vaults. The new payments platform would become a way to move around digitized cash, while preserving the creditworthiness and security of the central bank.</p>



<p>The resulting project, called Bakong, is the first retail payments system in the world using blockchain technology. Individuals can now transfer money and buy from merchants with a simple smartphone app. Merchants gain a fast, cashless, and secure payments system. And banks can do interbank transfers at much lower cost.</p>



<p>The pilot project went live in July 2019 and ran successfully with a network of 14 banks supporting more than 10,000 users, laying the groundwork for a large-scale rollout later this year.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with Soramitsu on a detailed case study covering the planning and implementation of Bakong, including key goals, milestones, security considerations and core technology requirements, as well as a preview of rollout plans and new features.</p>

<p>We are all about trustworthy collaboration on digital identity and personal information.&nbsp; We recognise that our online experience traverses an ecosystem of providers, platforms and technologies, and that effective collaboration and interoperability is key to better customer interactions and increased productivity.&nbsp; We believe that Identity is taonga (a Maori word meaning something precious and valued) – it is a treasure worthy of dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; This principle guides our collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How is DINZ &nbsp;and its members experiencing and reacting to the current global situation?</p>
<p>Digital&nbsp;Identity NZ’s 2020 research survey has found that there is a growing&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;of the way in which our personal information is harvested and used by&nbsp;organisations and technology providers, coupled with a high degree of anger and&nbsp;disappointment about the widespread sale and sharing of that information.&nbsp;91% of New Zealanders desire a greater level of control over their&nbsp;identity and personal information, and we are calling on organisations and their technology providers to take a greater share of responsibility.&nbsp; As organisations we have done an excellent job in&nbsp;raising awareness of some of the risks and challenges associated with our&nbsp;highly connected world, yet we are placing&nbsp;too heavy a burden on people to&nbsp;protect themselves without adjusting our systems and processes to make it&nbsp;easier for them to understand and take action.</p>
<p>3. How do you see the effects of the pandemic impacting digital identity beyond 2020?</p>
<p>Our research shows that more and more people are looking to online interactions first, rather than face to face.&nbsp; Two thirds of New Zealanders indicated that their first point of call is now online.&nbsp; Enabling that online interaction is a primary function of digital identity, and it is becoming increasingly important for all organisations to engage online, be they large and small, commercial, academic or community.</p>
<p>4. What’s high on DINZ’s agenda right now?</p>
<p>The management of identity and personal information is increasingly&nbsp;reliant on a trustworthy ecosystem of participants, adhering not only to&nbsp;technical and security&nbsp;standards, but also embracing principles of Kāwanatanga&nbsp;(Honourable Governance), Rangatiratanga (Self Determination &amp; Agency),&nbsp;Ōritetanga (Equity &amp;&nbsp;Partnership) and freedom of choice and&nbsp;expression. Building a trustworthy community of practice is a key activity for us.&nbsp; This is even more pertinent given the New Zealand Government’s emerging work on a legislated Trust Framework for digital identity.&nbsp; We are working closely with the agency responsible for developing the new framework, seeking collaborative action to refine and build a trustworthy ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the second part of our series on nationalism and its threat to digital identity, we analyze China, the chief proponent of cyber sovereignty. We analyze the primacy of nationalism as a tool for maintaining political control in China, as well as the importance of technology for validating the nationalist idea that China is a formidable global power.</p>



<p>The Trump administration’s announcement of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/announcing-the-expansion-of-the-clean-network-to-safeguard-americas-assets/#.XyskRCepNOE.twitter">Clean Network</a> program, in tandem with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html">twin bans of Tiktok and Wechat</a>, has stoked fears of an increasingly fragmented Internet and a brewing Tech Cold War. The underlying current of the burgeoning Tech Cold War is the global rise of nationalism. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/12/coronavirus-killing-globalization-nationalism-protectionism-trump/">COVID-19 has cast doubt on the viability of globalism</a>, as global supply chains have been heavily disrupted and travel bans continue to be the norm. The potential retreat from globalism has only played into the hands of the rising number of nationalist governments around the world; notable examples include the <a href="https://qz.com/1774201/the-global-state-of-right-wing-populism-in-2019/">U.S., Brazil, and India</a>.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Two key reasons are driving tech to the foreground in the global competition between nationalist ambitions. The first is data as both a weapon for national security purposes and&nbsp;<a href="https://interconnected.blog/data-center-coverage-aws-alibaba-azure-gcp/">a tool for national governance</a>; the second is technological might as a proxy for global power and influence. China’s prioritization of foundational digital identity concepts has helped them succeed in both aspects.</p>



<p>Though China rose to power as the factory of the world, the government has long recognized the importance of technology to their long-term growth. To spur the growth of its own tech industry,<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty"> China has been a strong proponent of “cyber sovereignty,”</a> a concept that essentially states that national sovereignty extends beyond physical barriers into cyberspace. Therefore, <a href="https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/09/07/the-chinese-cyber-sovereignty-concept-part-1/">governments, not companies or individuals,</a> have ultimate control over the Internet for its citizens. Cyber sovereignty has traditionally been casted as the diametric opposite to the idea of a free and open internet. These two models of the internet are symbolic for a broader ideological conflict between authoritarian and democratic governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/global-rise-internet-sovereignty/">As is often pointed out</a>, authoritarian governments can weaponize cyber sovereignty to curb citizens’ freedoms on the Internet and influence the tech industry to serve their own means. (Ironically enough, the Trump administration is targeting Chinese tech partly because cyber sovereignty allows the Chinese government undue control over private tech companies, but the administration is <a href="https://qz.com/1889077/us-clean-network-campaign-shuts-out-chinese-apps-from-network/">ultimately adopting</a> China’s vision of the Internet in doing so.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Chinese government has used cyber sovereignty to encourage the growth of juggernauts like Tencent and Alibaba, while also compelling these firms to advance the state’s initiatives (e.g. <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/05/we-chat-they-watch/">censorship on WeChat</a>). However, their methods have become increasingly aggressive under Xi Jinping’s rule, as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-trump-xi-cold-war-asia-conflict-huawei-tiktok-communist-party/2020/08/07/5a6531c4-cc91-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html">Xi uses nationalism to maintain power</a>, especially in light of COVID-19, slowing economic growth and his ambitions for an unprecedented third term in office (which would make him the longest-reigning leader since Mao Zedong). The <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/07/the-world-is-falling-for-chinas-hong-kong-trap/">sweeping crackdown on Hong Kong,</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/report/military-confrontation-south-china-sea">gradual encroachment on the South China Sea</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html">detention of Uyghurs to promote ethnocentrism</a> are all examples of how Xi strategically uses aggression to amplify external threats–around which Chinese citizens can unify–and tamp down any and all differences within the nation.</p>



<p>The Chinese government’s nationalist agenda <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/how-chinese-nationalism-is-changing/">can be bifurcated</a> by outward-facing diplomatic agendas–e.g. their recent actions against Hong Kong–and inward-facing campaigns to cultivate patriotic pride in their citizens. In matters of data privacy and technological might, these foreign and domestic campaigns are deeply intertwined.</p>



<p>Outwardly, the ambition has been to solidify their status as a global power by becoming a world leader in technology, as suggested by their <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/made-in-china-2025-explained/">Made in China 2025</a> initiative. Mass influence campaigns are another potential route through which the Chinese government seeks to exert power, but there is less evidence supporting this (<a href="https://interconnected.blog/a-framework-to-dis-trust-and-verify-tiktok/">though not none</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, China’s inward-facing tech policy is focused on promoting a peaceful society toward influence campaigns and economic growth via tech advancements. The government uses tech companies to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/15/134178/how-wechat-censors-private-conversations-automatically-in-real-time/">crack down on dissent</a> and<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/the-chinese-people-step-up-to-enforce-chinas-nationalist-propaganda/"> imbue patriotism</a> in Chinese citizens. In addition, the Chinese government acknowledges the growth of tech itself is necessary to fuel the continued growth of its economy, and in doing so, keep the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-freedoms-control.html">tacit promise</a> it has with its citizens of ensuring economic vitality in exchange for uncontested control.</p>



<p>Via&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/chinas-data-privacy/">their digital identity regime</a>, the Chinese government has effectively implemented an invasive and sophisticated surveillance system that at once accomplishes both outward and inward nationalist agendas. China is now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/us-china-tech-race-beijing-has-strength-to-catch-up-with-us-lead.html">widely-regarded&nbsp;</a>as a world leader in biometric and AI technology, which not only powers their surveillance system, but also has allowed companies like Sensetime, Megvii, and iFlytek to become multi-billion dollar companies.</p>



<p>A digital identity regime that can effectively track all user activity, online and offline, benefits more than just biometric companies and the government though. China’s sophisticated digital identity system essentially creates a data economy that stands to be incredibly powerful because of its ability for this data to be linked with a high degree of accuracy. In this way, their digital identity system is key to unlocking new breakthroughs in tech for China. Such a data economy can train AI algorithms to generate highly-targeted ads, create sophisticated fraud prevention tools, and more. Not coincidentally, Tiktok’s secret sauce is widely considered to be their <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">AI formula</a> that makes the likes of Facebook’s and Youtube’s look unsophisticated in comparison.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tiktok-and-the-great-firewall-of-america">TechNode</a> notes that China’s new <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/15265-2/">Data Security Law </a>reflects the importance that the Chinese government places on data. In enacting the law, the Chinese government seeks to regulate the data economy to serve its national security and economic benefits. I would also argue that nationalism plays an important role in the law as well. As part of China’s new civil code, the law is presented as legislation to protect citizens, not state interests. Specifically, the laws have a strong personal privacy component that is seemingly in response to rising privacy concerns of Chinese citizens.</p>



<p>As I have argued, the Chinese government does not rule simply by enforcing their will on its citizens. They are in fact highly sensitive to the wills of their citizens, because winning citizen favor is critical for the continued success of nationalist campaigns seeking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-thinks-patriotic-education-built-a-loyal-generation-but-in-hong-kong-not-so-fast/2019/11/28/80f4d586-0c2c-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html">instill patriotism</a> into Chinese citizens.</p>



<p>The Chinese government’s success in promoting nationalist sentiment and, specifically, positioning the Internet as a key battleground for its nationalist ambitions can be seen in Chinese citizens’ responses to the potential sale of Tiktok. While Tiktok battles scrutiny over its roots in China, parent company Bytedance is facing similar criticism in China over their perceived kowtowing to U.S. policy. Bytedance CEO and founder Zhang Yiming hid all his posts on Weibo, a popular social media platform, in response to a <a href="https://qz.com/1888102/bytedances-tiktok-sale-talks-with-microsoft-stir-anger-in-china/">torrent of backlash</a> from Chinese citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, now that other countries are starting to play China’s game of cyber sovereignty, has China actually won? The same policy that has propelled their tech industry is now threatening to undercut its growth. Countries are beginning to erect firewalls of their own against China’s technology. Even some Chinese technologists might argue China’s cyberspace strategy has backfired. The founder of the popular travel booking platform Ctrip <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways">James Liang</a>, in a now deleted post, has called for China to move towards a more open Internet to preserve the prosperity of China’s tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The national security concerns expressed on both sides may have legitimacy, but wholesale banning of apps does a disservice to citizens by taking away the freedom of choice and styming economic growth. Instead, strong regulation–such as&nbsp;<a href="https://interconnected.blog/a-framework-to-dis-trust-and-verify-tiktok/">that prescribed by Kevin Xu</a>&nbsp;in his blog– would address both legitimate concerns over data privacy and security, while preserving citizen choice and strengthening digital identity schemas for international cooperation. We will take a closer look into Europe next week, as the region takes the lead in enacting strong regulation to secure data privacy flows and further national interest.</p>



<p>But, as data continues to become an increasingly important tool for national governance globally and tech companies grow in power, it is unlikely that China will back down the escalating tit-for-tat Tech Cold War. To do so would be to run counter nationalist sentiments that sustain power in not just China but, increasingly, in today’s global order.</p>

<p>Florida-based First Citrus Bank provides premier independent community banking services to individuals, professionals, executives and entrepreneurs. With 70 employees in five locations, First Citrus is ranked in the top five Tampa Bay community banks by asset size.</p>



<p>Struggling with costs, complexities and security issues with passwords, First Citrus sought to increase security and usability for its employees logging into its various systems on shared Windows workstations. After testing several alternative authentication methods, First Citrus turned to FIDO Authentication as the best option to provide strong cryptographic authentication with a much easier passwordless user experience.</p>



<p>Eliminating the password</p>



<p>First Citrus sought to move away from passwords as the primary form of authentication for its employees logging on to its systems on shared Windows workstations. Between costly resets and a negative impact on employee productivity, First Citrus’s main objective was to eliminate the need for its employees to have to enter a password while providing secure user authentication.</p>



<p>The bank evaluated several desktop authentication options including smart cards and time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), but found that these options added friction for their employees’ logins, creating a poor user experience while not providing enough additional security. All of the options they reviewed also still required password entry.</p>



<p>Taking a standards-based approach to passwordless authentication</p>



<p>First Citrus then looked to FIDO Authentication, a standards-based approach to strong authentication. The interoperability that comes with taking a standards-based approach fit well into First Citrus’s broader security strategy.</p>



<p>FIDO standards use on-device public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication over passwords and other forms of strong authentication; user credentials are never shared and never leave the user’s device. The protocols are also designed from the ground up to protect user privacy. The protocols do not provide information that can be used by different online services to collaborate and track a user across the services, and biometric information never leaves the user’s device. This is all balanced with a simple user experience that meets passwordless use cases with native biometrics on the user’s device.</p>



<p>It was important to First Citrus to choose an end-to-end FIDO Certified solution in order to roll out FIDO Authentication to all of its access points with assured security and interoperability. The bank chose to work with HYPR, which offers FIDO Certified platforms for FIDO UAF (mobile-based passwordless authentication) and FIDO2 (mobile and desktop passwordless and second-factor authentication) standards. The mixture of these FIDO specifications allows First Citrus to cover mobile and desktop requirements for user authentication.</p>



<p>Simpler, mobile-initiated authentication for all employees</p>



<p>First Citrus deployed HYPR’s FIDO platform to provide truly passwordless authentication for all of its employees logging into Windows 7 and 10 workstations. Deployment was straightforward: within an hour, the bank was able to have computers leveraging FIDO Authentication. After a several-month evaluation period, First Citrus rolled out the FIDO solution to all of its employees in February 2019.</p>



<p>For First Citrus employees, logging in is now mobile-initiated. They simply use the native biometrics on their mobile device (iOS or Android) to log in to any First Citrus desktop workstation, with far higher FIDO security and privacy over the old password model. Employee feedback has been positive; the chief financial officer has joked, “I’ve completely forgotten my password!” HYPR’s FIDO Certified platform has now become a core component of First Citrus’s internal authentication strategy, with the possibility of extending FIDO authentication options to its online banking customers in the future.</p>

<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>First Citrus is ranked in the top
five Tampa Bay community banks
by asset size, with 70 employees
in five locations.</p>


<p>Objective<br>
First Citrus sought to eliminate the
need for employees to have to enter
a password while providing secure
user authentication.</p>
		

<p>Solution<br>

FIDO Certified authentication
platform, which provides simpler
and secure mobile-initiated biometric
logins for all employees to
Windows workstations.</p>
		

<p>What’s Next<br>
FIDO and HYPR have now become
core components of First Citrus’s
authentication strategy, with the
possibility of extending FIDO
authentication options to its online
banking customers in the future.</p>

&gt; The Issuer does not have any choice in whether the data subject’s

&gt; VCs. I am also promoting the use of secure data stores because Issuers 
&gt; will be able to use SDS in many more cases.

I think you are envisaging the SDS as part of the holder's agent 
(conceptually). Whilst it is true that the holder's agent talks to both 
Issuers and Verifiers in the VC model, nevertheless they are separate 
access points and are different, and would not be used "the other way 
around".&nbsp; So perhaps if you re-phrased your text to indicate that two 
separate and distinct access points exist, one for issuers and one for 
verifiers, that would be more convincing.

&gt;
&gt; As far as how I’m using PDP / PEP, it is very important that the 
&gt; requesting parties go to the data subject‘s agent (the PDP) first

the data subject's agent should be a PEP front end to a PDP. If you want 
you can require the PEP to accept access decision requests from the 
public. I think this would provide the functionality you need, and would 
conform to the standard model of a policy enforcement point.


&gt; so that the Issuer is not aware of their purpose or credentials or 
&gt; even the requested scope. All the Issuer gets to know, IF the data 
&gt; subject chooses to bypass their role as relay, is the Verifier's 
&gt; endpoint and the scope granted via the capability.
&gt;
&gt; As far as revocation, the choice of revocation method is worth further 
&gt; discussion. If we want to restrict issuers to ALWAYS use a dead-drop 
&gt; or equivalent means for revocation in order to ensure that the VCs 
&gt; they issue are the same no matter the choice of the data subject to 
&gt; bypass their relay role, that is a separate matter to discuss. My main 
&gt; point is to promote the use of VCs and reduce the cost of the agent of 
&gt; the data subject by having it store only policies rather than both 
&gt; policies and VCs.

conceptually policies are stored in PAPs, evaluated by PDPs and enforced 
by PEPs. These can of course be combined in one software program, but 
conceptually they still exist in that program.

Kind regards

David

&gt;     &gt; Please help me draft a PR to the appropriate place [did-core?

&gt;     issuing
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; a verifiable credential such that:
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; The Issuer:
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - *MAY* or *SHOULD* emit a VC via a standard API (e.g. a secure
&gt;     data
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; store)
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - the API protocol *MUST* support connection to both Holders or
&gt;     Verifiers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     connection to a verifier is in direct contradiction to the VC data
&gt;     model
&gt;
&gt;     and should be strongly opposed. One of the privacy strengths of
&gt;     VCs is
&gt;
&gt;     that the issuer does not know who the verifier is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     You say you want to cater for holders/subjects who do not care about
&gt;
&gt;     privacy, but by mandating this connection you are violating the
&gt;     rights
&gt;
&gt;     of subjects who do care about their privacy, because they wont be
&gt;     able
&gt;
&gt;     to protect it with what you propose.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; [DIDcomm and/or HTTPS, etc...]
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - the API *MUST* be a policy enforcement point (PEP). (the
&gt;     issuer can
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; run their own PDP, if they choose)
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - the authority respected by the PEP *MUST* be either the Issuer or
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; the Data Subject
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - the authority is a policy decision point (PDP) operated on
&gt;     behalf of
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; *either* the Issuer or the Data Subject
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - a requesting party *MUST* present their request to the PDP
&gt;     (not the PEP)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     That is in direct contradiction to the standard PEP/PDP model.
&gt;
&gt;     Requesters contact PEPs, and PEPs contact their own PDPs. What you
&gt;     want
&gt;
&gt;     to achieve can still be achieved by defining a PEP with the
&gt;     properties
&gt;
&gt;     you require and not by changing the overall standard model.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - that supports both self-authorized and subject-authorized
&gt;     requests
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; *MUST* offer separate APIs to reflect the separate PDPs.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; - *SHOULD* notify the data subject when they receive or process an
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; access request via the self-authorized API
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; The main goal here is to encourage Issuers to behave as oracles and
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; remove the adoption barrier of having to have a Holder when all the
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; data subject needs is an authorization server because they don't
&gt;     care
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; if the Issuer knows about the Verifier.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; Another goal is to simplify revocation in cases where the data
&gt;     subject
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; doesn't care if the Issuer knows about the Verifier.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     You cant have users who do care about privacy and users who don't
&gt;     care
&gt;
&gt;     about privacy sharing the same revocation service, since the
&gt;     wishes of
&gt;
&gt;     the users who do care will be disregarded.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; Yet another goal is to protect the privacy of data subjects who
&gt;     would
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; prefer to process Verifier (as requesting party) access requests
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; (scope, purpose, credential) at a policy decision point (PDP)
&gt;     separate
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; from the Issuer (as PEP). The Verifier would then be given a
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; capability to be presented to the Issuer PEP.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; We recognize that the requesting party (Verifier) has legitimate
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; privacy concerns of their own and may prefer to present their
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; credentials to the Issuer rather than the Holder. In these
&gt;     cases, the
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; Issuer MAY offer a PDP of their own and the data subject SHOULD be
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; notified of the scope, purpose, and identity of the requesting
&gt;     party
&gt;
&gt;     &gt; (Verifier) as allowed by the policies of the PDP.

&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;would make public assertions about their practices. The
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;assertions could be:
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- policies, commitments, or audits that are associated with

&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;individuals.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Either way, the assertions are typically public such as
&gt;     state
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;medical licenses, federal DEA numbers, voter rolls, real
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;estate, food and liquor licenses, law enforcement, license
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;plates, D&amp;B reports, court filings, sex offenders, white and
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yellow pages, etc. Access to these assertions was seldom
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;limited before networking because there was sufficient
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;friction to keep all but the most dedicated data brokers at
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bay. The friction also drove a business model around sale of
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;this public information.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These public assertions are now the feedstock for
&gt;     thousands of
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;data brokers operating as a broad surveillance mechanism,
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;privatized, and without much transparency or regulation.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I call these public assertion issuers oracles because it
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;matches how the term is used in smart contracts.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An oracle's public assertions can be open, behind a paywall,
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or restricted access. In the case of pay or access
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;restrictions, the reason typically has nothing to do
&gt;     with the
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;consent of the data subject. The restriction is based on the
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;credentials of the requesting party such as law enforcement
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;access to auto registry information or a no-fly list. Data
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brokers consume assertions from other oracles and act as
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;oracles themselves, typically without the consent of the
&gt;     data
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;subject.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because consent does not figure into the practices of most

&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;oracles, be they public or private, the only reason to
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;introduce a holder and their wallet is to avoid loss of
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;privacy through traffic analysis. That's an important
&gt;     feature
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but there are many situations where the data subject really
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;has no worries about the oracle knowing who the
&gt;     verifiers are.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oracles can, by policy, choose to erase access logs after 24
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hours. The assertions are often subject to revocation and
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;having the verifier contact the oracle directly is more
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;efficient than dead-drops.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In most any case, the data subject can always choose to
&gt;     make a
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;copy of the assertion by the oracle in the form of a
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;verifiable credential.
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My point is that oracles could be using VCs regardless
&gt;     of what
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;assertions they're making or whether the VC is going to a
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;holder or a verifier. The only difference is whether the
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;request is made by the data subject themselves (to go to
&gt;     their
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wallet) or by a verifier directly. Payment and revocation
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;would need to be considered, of course. Some oracles would
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;need to process requests as discussed in
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020May/0049.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020May/0049.html</a>
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;using protocols like GNAP

&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oracles as Issuers has protocol implications for both access
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;control and transport. How should we continue this
&gt;     discussion?
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very much agree that verifiable claims can be used as oracles

         Hi David,

I think my proposal enhances privacy in every way. The Issuer does not have
any choice in whether the data subject’s agent is also a store for VCs. All
I’m doing is promoting the use of VCs. I am also promoting the use of
secure data stores because Issuers will be able to use SDS in many more
cases.

As far as how I’m using PDP / PEP, it is very important that the requesting
parties go to the data subject‘s agent (the PDP) first so that the Issuer
is not aware of their purpose or credentials or even the requested scope.
All the Issuer gets to know, IF the data subject chooses to bypass their
role as relay, is the Verifier's endpoint and the scope granted via the
capability.

As far as revocation, the choice of revocation method is worth further
discussion. If we want to restrict issuers to ALWAYS use a dead-drop or
equivalent means for revocation in order to ensure that the VCs they issue
are the same no matter the choice of the data subject to bypass their relay
role, that is a separate matter to discuss. My main point is to promote the
use of VCs and reduce the cost of the agent of the data subject by having
it store only policies rather than both policies and VCs.

&gt; Hi Adrian
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; whilst your goals have some merit, your proposed way of achieving it has
&gt;
&gt; some serious flaws, see below

&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Please help me draft a PR to the appropriate place [did-core?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; did-use-cases? secure-data-store?] that describes the API for issuing
&gt;
&gt; &gt; a verifiable credential such that:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The Issuer:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - *MAY* or *SHOULD* emit a VC via a standard API (e.g. a secure data
&gt;
&gt; &gt; store)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - the API protocol *MUST* support connection to both Holders or Verifiers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; connection to a verifier is in direct contradiction to the VC data model
&gt;
&gt; and should be strongly opposed. One of the privacy strengths of VCs is
&gt;
&gt; that the issuer does not know who the verifier is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You say you want to cater for holders/subjects who do not care about
&gt;
&gt; privacy, but by mandating this connection you are violating the rights
&gt;
&gt; of subjects who do care about their privacy, because they wont be able
&gt;
&gt; to protect it with what you propose.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; [DIDcomm and/or HTTPS, etc...]
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - the API *MUST* be a policy enforcement point (PEP). (the issuer can
&gt;
&gt; &gt; run their own PDP, if they choose)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - the authority respected by the PEP *MUST* be either the Issuer or
&gt;
&gt; &gt; the Data Subject
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - the authority is a policy decision point (PDP) operated on behalf of
&gt;
&gt; &gt; *either* the Issuer or the Data Subject
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - a requesting party *MUST* present their request to the PDP (not the
&gt; PEP)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; That is in direct contradiction to the standard PEP/PDP model.
&gt;
&gt; Requesters contact PEPs, and PEPs contact their own PDPs. What you want
&gt;
&gt; to achieve can still be achieved by defining a PEP with the properties
&gt;
&gt; you require and not by changing the overall standard model.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - that supports both self-authorized and subject-authorized requests
&gt;
&gt; &gt; *MUST* offer separate APIs to reflect the separate PDPs.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - *SHOULD* notify the data subject when they receive or process an
&gt;
&gt; &gt; access request via the self-authorized API
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The main goal here is to encourage Issuers to behave as oracles and
&gt;
&gt; &gt; remove the adoption barrier of having to have a Holder when all the
&gt;
&gt; &gt; data subject needs is an authorization server because they don't care
&gt;
&gt; &gt; if the Issuer knows about the Verifier.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Another goal is to simplify revocation in cases where the data subject
&gt;
&gt; &gt; doesn't care if the Issuer knows about the Verifier.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You cant have users who do care about privacy and users who don't care
&gt;
&gt; about privacy sharing the same revocation service, since the wishes of
&gt;
&gt; the users who do care will be disregarded.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; David
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Yet another goal is to protect the privacy of data subjects who would
&gt;
&gt; &gt; prefer to process Verifier (as requesting party) access requests
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (scope, purpose, credential) at a policy decision point (PDP) separate
&gt;
&gt; &gt; from the Issuer (as PEP). The Verifier would then be given a
&gt;
&gt; &gt; capability to be presented to the Issuer PEP.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; We recognize that the requesting party (Verifier) has legitimate
&gt;
&gt; &gt; privacy concerns of their own and may prefer to present their
&gt;
&gt; &gt; credentials to the Issuer rather than the Holder. In these cases, the
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Issuer MAY offer a PDP of their own and the data subject SHOULD be
&gt;
&gt; &gt; notified of the scope, purpose, and identity of the requesting party
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (Verifier) as allowed by the policies of the PDP.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;         During today's CCG call we discussed ways that an institution
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         would make public assertions about their practices. The
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         assertions could be:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         - policies, commitments, or audits that are associated with
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         the institution in general, or
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         - certifications, badges, or licenses associated with specific
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         individuals.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         Either way, the assertions are typically public such as state
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         medical licenses, federal DEA numbers, voter rolls, real
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         estate, food and liquor licenses, law enforcement, license
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         plates, D&amp;B reports, court filings, sex offenders, white and
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         yellow pages, etc. Access to these assertions was seldom
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         limited before networking because there was sufficient
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         friction to keep all but the most dedicated data brokers at
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         bay. The friction also drove a business model around sale of
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         this public information.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         These public assertions are now the feedstock for thousands of
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         data brokers operating as a broad surveillance mechanism,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         privatized, and without much transparency or regulation.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         I call these public assertion issuers oracles because it
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         matches how the term is used in smart contracts.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         An oracle's public assertions can be open, behind a paywall,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         or restricted access. In the case of pay or access
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         restrictions, the reason typically has nothing to do with the
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         consent of the data subject. The restriction is based on the
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         credentials of the requesting party such as law enforcement
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         access to auto registry information or a no-fly list. Data
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         brokers consume assertions from other oracles and act as
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         oracles themselves, typically without the consent of the data
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         subject.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         Because consent does not figure into the practices of most
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         oracles, be they public or private, the only reason to
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         introduce a holder and their wallet is to avoid loss of
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         privacy through traffic analysis. That's an important feature
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         but there are many situations where the data subject really
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         has no worries about the oracle knowing who the verifiers are.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         Oracles can, by policy, choose to erase access logs after 24
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         hours. The assertions are often subject to revocation and
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         having the verifier contact the oracle directly is more
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         efficient than dead-drops.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         In most any case, the data subject can always choose to make a
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         copy of the assertion by the oracle in the form of a
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         verifiable credential.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         My point is that oracles could be using VCs regardless of what
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         assertions they're making or whether the VC is going to a
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         holder or a verifier. The only difference is whether the
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         request is made by the data subject themselves (to go to their
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         wallet) or by a verifier directly. Payment and revocation
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         would need to be considered, of course. Some oracles would
&gt;
&gt; &gt;         need to process requests as discussed in

&gt;
&gt; The Issuer:
&gt; - *MAY* or *SHOULD* emit a VC via a standard API (e.g. a secure data 
&gt; store)
&gt; - the API protocol *MUST* support connection to both Holders or Verifiers

connection to a verifier is in direct contradiction to the VC data model 
and should be strongly opposed. One of the privacy strengths of VCs is 
that the issuer does not know who the verifier is.

You say you want to cater for holders/subjects who do not care about 
privacy, but by mandating this connection you are violating the rights 
of subjects who do care about their privacy, because they wont be able 
to protect it with what you propose.

&gt; [DIDcomm and/or HTTPS, etc...]
&gt; - the API *MUST* be a policy enforcement point (PEP). (the issuer can 
&gt; run their own PDP, if they choose)
&gt; - the authority respected by the PEP *MUST* be either the Issuer or 
&gt; the Data Subject
&gt; - the authority is a policy decision point (PDP) operated on behalf of 
&gt; *either* the Issuer or the Data Subject
&gt; - a requesting party *MUST* present their request to the PDP (not the PEP)

That is in direct contradiction to the standard PEP/PDP model. 
Requesters contact PEPs, and PEPs contact their own PDPs. What you want 
to achieve can still be achieved by defining a PEP with the properties 
you require and not by changing the overall standard model.


&gt; - that supports both self-authorized and subject-authorized requests 
&gt; *MUST* offer separate APIs to reflect the separate PDPs.
&gt; - *SHOULD* notify the data subject when they receive or process an 
&gt; access request via the self-authorized API
&gt;
&gt; The main goal here is to encourage Issuers to behave as oracles and 
&gt; remove the adoption barrier of having to have a Holder when all the 
&gt; data subject needs is an authorization server because they don't care 
&gt; if the Issuer knows about the Verifier.
&gt;
&gt; Another goal is to simplify revocation in cases where the data subject 
&gt; doesn't care if the Issuer knows about the Verifier.

You cant have users who do care about privacy and users who don't care 
about privacy sharing the same revocation service, since the wishes of 
the users who do care will be disregarded.

Kind regards

David

&gt;
&gt; Yet another goal is to protect the privacy of data subjects who would 
&gt; prefer to process Verifier (as requesting party) access requests 
&gt; (scope, purpose, credential) at a policy decision point (PDP) separate 
&gt; from the Issuer (as PEP). The Verifier would then be given a 
&gt; capability to be presented to the Issuer PEP.
&gt;
&gt; We recognize that the requesting party (Verifier) has legitimate 
&gt; privacy concerns of their own and may prefer to present their 
&gt; credentials to the Issuer rather than the Holder. In these cases, the 
&gt; Issuer MAY offer a PDP of their own and the data subject SHOULD be 
&gt; notified of the scope, purpose, and identity of the requesting party 
&gt; (Verifier) as allowed by the policies of the PDP.

&gt;
&gt;         During today's CCG call we discussed ways that an institution
&gt;         would make public assertions about their practices. The
&gt;         assertions could be:
&gt;         - policies, commitments, or audits that are associated with
&gt;         the institution in general, or
&gt;         - certifications, badges, or licenses associated with specific
&gt;         individuals.
&gt;
&gt;         Either way, the assertions are typically public such as state
&gt;         medical licenses, federal DEA numbers, voter rolls, real
&gt;         estate, food and liquor licenses, law enforcement, license
&gt;         plates, D&amp;B reports, court filings, sex offenders, white and
&gt;         yellow pages, etc. Access to these assertions was seldom
&gt;         limited before networking because there was sufficient
&gt;         friction to keep all but the most dedicated data brokers at
&gt;         bay. The friction also drove a business model around sale of
&gt;         this public information.
&gt;
&gt;         These public assertions are now the feedstock for thousands of
&gt;         data brokers operating as a broad surveillance mechanism,
&gt;         privatized, and without much transparency or regulation.
&gt;
&gt;         I call these public assertion issuers oracles because it
&gt;         matches how the term is used in smart contracts.
&gt;
&gt;         An oracle's public assertions can be open, behind a paywall,
&gt;         or restricted access. In the case of pay or access
&gt;         restrictions, the reason typically has nothing to do with the
&gt;         consent of the data subject. The restriction is based on the
&gt;         credentials of the requesting party such as law enforcement
&gt;         access to auto registry information or a no-fly list. Data
&gt;         brokers consume assertions from other oracles and act as
&gt;         oracles themselves, typically without the consent of the data
&gt;         subject.
&gt;
&gt;         Because consent does not figure into the practices of most
&gt;         oracles, be they public or private, the only reason to
&gt;         introduce a holder and their wallet is to avoid loss of
&gt;         privacy through traffic analysis. That's an important feature
&gt;         but there are many situations where the data subject really
&gt;         has no worries about the oracle knowing who the verifiers are.
&gt;         Oracles can, by policy, choose to erase access logs after 24
&gt;         hours. The assertions are often subject to revocation and
&gt;         having the verifier contact the oracle directly is more
&gt;         efficient than dead-drops.
&gt;
&gt;         In most any case, the data subject can always choose to make a
&gt;         copy of the assertion by the oracle in the form of a
&gt;         verifiable credential.
&gt;
&gt;         My point is that oracles could be using VCs regardless of what
&gt;         assertions they're making or whether the VC is going to a
&gt;         holder or a verifier. The only difference is whether the
&gt;         request is made by the data subject themselves (to go to their
&gt;         wallet) or by a verifier directly. Payment and revocation
&gt;         would need to be considered, of course. Some oracles would
&gt;         need to process requests as discussed in

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Mavennet?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mavennet.com/">Mavennet’s</a> vision is to build a new world of trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to empower large enterprises with better and more effective ways to securely share information and value. We build on technologies such as blockchain and AI to help transform entire industries. Our focus extends to several industries: financial services, supply chain, energy, the public sector and media and entertainment. Our business focuses on challenging the status quo of industries that are in need for disruption, either internally or externally.</p>



 <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity is at the foundation of any sharing of value or information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional identity management systems are vulnerable to single points of failure, they raise privacy issues for the data they carry and limit the possibility of secure interoperability. In industries with business processes that rely on complex workflows or transactions amongst multiple stakeholders, the need for trustworthy digital identity becomes paramount.</p>



<p>At Mavennet, we are implementing decentralized identifiers to our suite of supply chain products to be able to associate a robust digital identity to actors and assets along a network. In conjunction with verifiable credentials (VCs) we&nbsp;enable cryptographically sound and privacy preserving claims that provide transparency and traceability to value chain participants. Ultimately, this trusted digital history of physical assets enables industries to have reliable provenance of goods and attribute actions to stakeholders. This addresses the most pressing pain points of global supply chains: traceability, auditability, flexibility and stakeholder management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlocking trustworthy digital identity in a way that is easy to implement in existing enterprise environments and can be readily adopted by multiple industries is crucial. It opens new pathways to emerging markets that are vulnerable to lack of trust amongst participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Mavennet address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the lack of responsiveness and flexibility of global supply chains, as evidenced by the spike in closures of manufacturing facilities and the unmet demand for basic commodities. An added concern for international trade is the rise in counterfeiting, which exceeds&nbsp;$900 billion USD annually. These threats to the security and stability of global supply chains can be in part offset by the adoption of digital identities. Their power to unlock fast, secure and trustworthy exchanges, can significantly improve the operational and business process efficiency of industries as a whole. This overhaul of internal traditional processes translates into more globally competitive businesses and positions Canada as an incrementally valuable trading partner.</p>



<p>Mavennet has been deeply involved in the space of decentralized identities and VCs&nbsp;through the deployment of an energy traceability platform that provides end-to-end visibility of assets. This solution, called Neoflow, has laid out new standards for exchange of data in the form of VCs between supply chain stakeholders by identifying them with a unique decentralized identifier. Our goal is to aid the transformation towards digital identities by providing a set of standards and APIs that enable seamless integration with other vendors with the same vision and legacy systems.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is particularly well poised to act as a leader in this space, given its strong international voice relative to its size.</p>



<p>Canada has a unique opportunity to drive the standards for adoption at an international level, due to its position as a global emerging innovation ecosystem and technology hub. Further, as a top global exporter of crude oil, gold, wheat, aluminum and others, Canada plays a key role in the way that international trade is conducted. The country has the international relevance to coordinate and propagate digital identity initiatives.</p>



<p>5. Why did Mavennet join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Defining identity standards collaboratively is an essential step when you are looking at transforming entire industries. Up to now we have been doing work with decentralized identity and VCs standards applied to the industries we focus on. We hope to leverage our experience and vision to contribute to the work DIACC does and help raise the water level for Canadian technology as a whole.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about Mavennet?</p>



<p>We are currently working on exciting solutions for governments and multinational companies in Canada, US and Europe. The core IP of these solutions involves identity management, asset traceability, digital assets, analytics and artificial intelligence. Some of these are:</p>



  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/neoflow/">Neoflow</a> – provides end-to-end digital traceability for energy. In particular we are working with the United States Department of Homeland Security&nbsp; to help with traceability in the oil and gas sector.

Dear Colleagues,

Today, ACE and ED launched the Blockchain Innovation Challenge for applications.


  *   The Education Blockchain Initiative&lt;<a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Education-Blockchain-Initiative.aspx">https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Education-Blockchain-Initiative.aspx</a>&gt;, funded by the U.S. Department of Education,  seeks to explore both the opportunities and the risks of utilizing blockchain to empower learners and translate skills and educational experiences into economic opportunity.
  *   Blockchain holds the unique potential to give learners, including the most underserved learners, control over their data and enable more seamless transitions from education to employment (and back) throughout their lives.
  *   On June 8, the Education Blockchain Initiative released a research report&lt;<a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/ACE-Education-Blockchain-Initiative-Connected-Impact-June2020.pdf">https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/ACE-Education-Blockchain-Initiative-Connected-Impact-June2020.pdf</a>&gt; on existing usage of blockchain in education as well as its potential to equitably expand economic opportunity. The research will inform a $900,000 Blockchain Innovation Challenge&lt;<a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Blockchain-Innovation-Challenge.aspx">https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Blockchain-Innovation-Challenge.aspx</a>&gt; to seed blockchain projects that have the potential to boost economic mobility. Organizations and individuals can learn more and express interest in the challenge on ACE’s website.

Press release:

&gt; public assertions about their practices. The assertions could be:
&gt; - policies, commitments, or audits that are associated with the
&gt; institution in general, or
&gt; - certifications, badges, or licenses associated with specific individuals.
&gt;
&gt; Either way, the assertions are typically public such as state medical
&gt; licenses, federal DEA numbers, voter rolls, real estate, food and liquor
&gt; licenses, law enforcement, license plates, D&amp;B reports, court filings, sex
&gt; offenders, white and yellow pages, etc. Access to these assertions was
&gt; seldom limited before networking because there was sufficient friction to
&gt; keep all but the most dedicated data brokers at bay. The friction also
&gt; drove a business model around sale of this public information.
&gt;
&gt; These public assertions are now the feedstock for thousands of data
&gt; brokers operating as a broad surveillance mechanism, privatized, and
&gt; without much transparency or regulation.
&gt;
&gt; I call these public assertion issuers oracles because it matches how the
&gt; term is used in smart contracts.
&gt;
&gt; An oracle's public assertions can be open, behind a paywall, or restricted
&gt; access. In the case of pay or access restrictions, the reason typically has
&gt; nothing to do with the consent of the data subject. The restriction is
&gt; based on the credentials of the requesting party such as law enforcement
&gt; access to auto registry information or a no-fly list. Data brokers consume
&gt; assertions from other oracles and act as oracles themselves, typically
&gt; without the consent of the data subject.
&gt;
&gt; Because consent does not figure into the practices of most oracles, be
&gt; they public or private, the only reason to introduce a holder and their
&gt; wallet is to avoid loss of privacy through traffic analysis. That's an
&gt; important feature but there are many situations where the data subject
&gt; really has no worries about the oracle knowing who the verifiers are.
&gt; Oracles can, by policy, choose to erase access logs after 24 hours. The
&gt; assertions are often subject to revocation and having the verifier contact
&gt; the oracle directly is more efficient than dead-drops.
&gt;
&gt; In most any case, the data subject can always choose to make a copy of the
&gt; assertion by the oracle in the form of a verifiable credential.
&gt;
&gt; My point is that oracles could be using VCs regardless of what assertions
&gt; they're making or whether the VC is going to a holder or a verifier. The
&gt; only difference is whether the request is made by the data subject
&gt; themselves (to go to their wallet) or by a verifier directly. Payment and
&gt; revocation would need to be considered, of course. Some oracles would need
&gt; to process requests as discussed in
&gt; <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020May/0049.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020May/0049.html</a>
&gt; using protocols like GNAP
&gt; <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richer-transactional-authz-09">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richer-transactional-authz-09</a>.
&gt;
&gt; Oracles as Issuers has protocol implications for both access control and
&gt; transport. How should we continue this discussion?
&gt;

Very much agree that verifiable claims can be used as oracles

That's how you tie together block chain crypto and the web, in order to
make things scale to millions of participants

As a data point, one design goal that we were successful in achieving

website, much in the way schema.org publishes data about the
company/website/hours of operation/ratings/etc. today:

</a><a href="https://schema.org/docs/about.html">https://schema.org/docs/about.html</a>

This is how most of us find out about companies and people today -- go
to a search engine, search for the thing you want, an infobox shows up
on the right with details about the thing you searched for. Example here
(click on JSON-LD at bottom):

<a href="https://schema.org/openingHours">https://schema.org/openingHours</a>

None of that information today is verifiable, but we could make it
verifiable by telling website publishers to upgrade the JSON-LD they
publish for schema.org today with Verifiable Credentials (which are
JSON-LD data with digital signatures). Same protocol, same process,
search engines already consume this information. No extra protocol work
necessary.

Just a data point... way easier than working on a new protocol and would
have immediate relevance.

<p>2018 was a revolutionary year when it came to data privacy. The rules of GDPR came into effect, including a mandate that storage and retrieval of data be 100% irrefutable.</p>



<p>For Joisto, a well known, highly compliant, multi-tenancy electronic archive and retrieval platform, GDPR meant customers started asking if they could add another layer of trust to their archive solutions. And that was no small task as Joisto specialized in large volume, high speed management and storage of over a 1,000 data and document types with full integrity for many sectors including finance, government and utility.</p>



<p>To solve this challenge, a small team of highly skilled developers created the ultimate solution: a blockchain-enabled archive. Joisto structured the state-of-the-art Blockchain Archive so companies can get the benefits of blockchain technology while still adhering to the GDPR standards, which require a single data controller. Solving the puzzle without a DLT would not be possible; only this technology makes it possible to store immutable records while still being flexible enough to comply with regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform, which was launched in January, 2020, was built on Hyperledger Fabric. Working with an open source blockchain was an obvious choice as Joisto is an open source platform, too. The company also needed a framework that supports multi-tenancy and didn’t use Proof of Work, and Hyperledger Fabric fulfilled both requirements.</p>



<p>The Hyperledger team has worked closely with Joisto to capture the drivers for developing a blockchain-enabled archive solution along with the details for this white label offering that is now heading into live beta deployments through the service provider market.&nbsp;</p>

the separation of concerns model that leads to decentralized AND generative
systems.

In these terms, both the oracle and the issuer are protected resources
(PEPs) with standard APIs for interoperability. For generativity, the same
API should be used  regardless of whether the connection is to a holder or
a verifier. Therefore the API would have a VC data model and capabilities
protection. The only policies at the resource are of the resource server
entity (oracle or issuer) and not of the data subject of the VC. The data
subject's policies are safe within a wallet or agent that acts as the PDP.

&gt;&gt; seldom limited before networking because there was sufficient friction to
&gt;&gt; keep all but the most dedicated data brokers at bay. The friction also
&gt;&gt; drove a business model around sale of this public information.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; An oracle's public assertions can be open, behind a paywall, or
&gt;&gt; restricted access. In the case of pay or access restrictions, the reason
&gt;&gt; typically has nothing to do with the consent of the data subject. The
&gt;&gt; restriction is based on the credentials of the requesting party such as law
&gt;&gt; enforcement access to auto registry information or a no-fly list. Data
&gt;&gt; brokers consume assertions from other oracles and act as oracles
&gt;&gt; themselves, typically without the consent of the data subject.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Because consent does not figure into the practices of most oracles, be
&gt;&gt; they public or private, the only reason to introduce a holder and their
&gt;&gt; wallet is to avoid loss of privacy through traffic analysis. That's an
&gt;&gt; important feature but there are many situations where the data subject
&gt;&gt; really has no worries about the oracle knowing who the verifiers are.
&gt;&gt; Oracles can, by policy, choose to erase access logs after 24 hours. The
&gt;&gt; assertions are often subject to revocation and having the verifier contact
&gt;&gt; the oracle directly is more efficient than dead-drops.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In most any case, the data subject can always choose to make a copy of
&gt;&gt; the assertion by the oracle in the form of a verifiable credential.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My point is that oracles could be using VCs regardless of what assertions
&gt;&gt; they're making or whether the VC is going to a holder or a verifier. The
&gt;&gt; only difference is whether the request is made by the data subject
&gt;&gt; themselves (to go to their wallet) or by a verifier directly. Payment and

Topic: LOCI + Germ Scene Investigations

Samantha Mathews Chase:  Inspired by this community, i enjoy 
  building things, dogfooding... after discovering OrgBook....
  ... we have been building a way for information sharing 
  regarding spaces
  ... we focused on evacuation maps and fire safety
  ... we are creating a way for orgs that are liable, for 
  capturing occupants, in safety training
  ... as we were rolling out our pilot, Covid hit, and we started 
  looking at how we could modify our work
  ... a fire and a virus are similar... they both need to be 
  stopped from spreading by people working together.
  ... we found that misinformation we spreading in a way that was 
  alarming, because of the way the CDC gave instruction.
  ... it lacked the "why"... in a way that adults like to learn.
  ... we focused on creating critical safety content for 
  adults...
  ... by the end of our course, adults have answered the 
  questions that become the safety protocol.
  ... we realized that the businesses lacked the tools to create 
  safety guidelines
  ... there were inconsistently applied safety warnings
  ... lots of "signing wavers" to enter shared space...
  ... we made a game, where any business can create their own 
  safety protocols, for example, symptom tracking or contact 
  tracing.
  ... any business can do this for free, it helps business define 
  a code of conduct, and avoids debates on masks
  ... we were eager to use the OrgBook, because we had previously 
  designed a credential for fire safety
  ... we are using the OrgBook as a search feature... so we can 
  issue credentials to the org book itself
  ... the way that buildings are designed is for fire zones... 
  they are signed off on by inspectors... they are held as public 
  information managed by the building owner...
  ... unfortunatly, they exist only as PDFs... the fire 
  department knows which zone a fire is in however.
  ... this is valuable information (zones in a building / 
  entrances and exits)
  ... we want to use the existing zones and inspection 
  information, and rather than rely on admins to manage this, we 
  want associate addresses with that location.
  ... wondering what stops us from attaching property to 
  organizations
  ... if we can attach property to organizations, we can start to 
  address human use cases.
  ... its helpful to be able to see who is responsibility for the 
  fire evacuation map
  ... credentials are maintained because people are present...
  ... would love to see how to use OrgBook to attach proof to 
  organization via the property they manage.
  ... questions?
Adrian Gropper:  Thanks! what part of what you are doing in 
  private and what part is public and what is accessible only to 
  first responders...
Samantha Mathews Chase:  Its all public info, but its all owner 
  managed... there is no central repository for this public info
  ... anyone who asks for this, must be given the information
Adrian Gropper:  Are you describing an oracle vs a credential... 
  in other words, there is no reason for a holder, other than the 
  issuer itself.
Samantha Mathews Chase:  Yes, the organization can hold all these 
  credentials.
Adrian Gropper:  If the data is all public legally binding, and 
  there is no holder... the oracle could rely on VCs or not.
  ... the number of oracles in industries is limited...
  ... if its an oracle?
Samantha Mathews Chase:  Not sure, looking for guidance
  ...  we are trying to use the OrgBook in a way that might be 
  more widely used... figuring out what other public information 
  can be attached to businesses
  ... how can i advocate for attaching public information to 
  OrgBook entries
Adrian Gropper:  There are some issues raised around resource 
  requests.... there are 3 components
  ... scope, purpose and credentials of the requestor
  ... for protected resources, the scope depends on what the 
  resource server is willing to honor
  ... in general resource servers should publish the scopes they 
  are willing to support.
  ... that sounds like what OrgBook is doing.
  ... the organization may choose to protect some information, 
  but before we can ask for that info, the OrgBook must publish 
  what it supports.
Heather Vescent:  2 Interesting parts.... info about the building 
  identity.... and gamification of safety learning
  ... games to get credentials... the second part.... seems very 
  generic
Samantha Mathews Chase:  Yes, we use it to discover valid 
  businesses, that could be used elsewhere...
  ... the way it works is maintaining reported occupancy / 
  training ratio
Adrian Gropper: Dun &amp; Bradstreet is a common oracle for business 
  uses.
  ... proof of learning... we are keen to see in a non org book 
  location, how we can turn these "proof of training" credentials 
  into passports of sort.
  ... or leverage them in other scenarios
  ... not sure how exactly to use the credentials we are 
  creating.
Juan Caballero:  Where would the credentials live?
  ... i heard in the netherlands, they have an a centralized 
  building registry... wondering who owns the locker...
Samantha Mathews Chase:  We are looking at how other institutions 
  could take over issuance
  ... firemarshalls are the issuers of the training game.
  ... in covid scenario, we are wondering who the issuer would 
  be?
  ... we talked with solid about lockers for employee / 
  contractor credentials
  ... safety training leads to stickers for hard hats....
  ... investigating Solid technology that could be used a wallet.
  ... questions about credential expiration
  ... i know solid is looking at finance and banking... im 
  interested in solving this for places that have contractors and 
  unions
  ... were trust issues are not going away... for example 
  confined spaces in ships
  ... we order temperature checking vests for staff, and the 
  union squashed it because they had no place to store personal 
  data.
  ... interested in scaling up safety related credentials that 
  facilitate cooperation between unions and organizations.
Juan Caballero:  Insurance seems very related on the employer 
  side.
Samantha Mathews Chase:  You don't want them to see the stuff, 
  you want them to know its being tracked.
  ... I see a lot of opportunity for this where lots of unions 
  exist
  ... how workers prove things about themselves, is a problem 
  that needs to be solved.
Heather Vescent:  Thanks, very interesting project.
Juan Caballero: GLEIF, you mean?
Adrian Gropper:  Asking the group: should public oracles be a use 
  case for VCs, and where / how would we do that?
  ... consider FHIR (healthcare rest api)
  ... the data model exists... but the problem is how to relate 
  FHIR to VC data model for public oracle use cases.
  ... when an institution has a resource server using FHIR, how 
  can VCs be integrated?
Christopher Allen:  Suggestion where we might want to deploy 
  this... wyoming
  ... sec state has approved corporate registration and good 
  standing...
  ... most likely it will use VCs
Kaliya Young: HI I got on the IRC really late (but was listening) 
  can someone please share the link to what SamanthaMatthewsChase 
  presented.
Samantha Mathews Chase: Loci.ca/gsi
Heather Vescent: @Identitywoman Sam sent it to the CCG email list
Heather Vescent: +1 SamanthaMatthewsChase
  ... large mining /oil / resource companies... interested to see 
  how this safety work would relate to those industries
  ... they are building something like OrgBook
  ... they want to be a leader in digital identity
Samantha Mathews Chase: Really great information thanks 
  Christopher, would love an introduction
  ... nobody has connected this to the powerful minins/g commitee
Samantha Mathews Chase:  Awesome, thanks.. to adgroppers point, 
  unsure of how those data sources would be connected...
  ... we are the issuer of our credential today, but the goal 
  would be to have 3rd parties become the issuer
  ... migth be easier to prove you control a property than other 
  things...
Adrian Gropper:  We have made the assumption that when a board 
  issues a credential it needs to go into a wallet... seems like 
  small number of use cases... public oracles seems larger use case
  ... as VC folks, we should recognize the opportunity to meet 
  the 90% op
  ... for example, drivers license registry should not be in a 
  public oracle... though revocation information might
  ... your use cases seem like VCs that don't belong in wallets.
Samantha Mathews Chase: +1 Adrian, great thoughts
Kaliya Young: Yes I understand she sent them to the list. I went 
  to my inbox to search for them and can't find them.  A subject 
  line or an e-mail address they are from would be helpful.
Heather Vescent: @Identitywoman @SamanthaMatthewsChase posted it 
  here: loci.ca/gsi
Christopher Allen:  This raises issues, Wyoming funded land 
  registries to add data related to blockchain... in some counties
Samantha Mathews Chase: Forwarded it to you @kaliya
Kaliya Young: Thanks! appreciate it.
  ... i was able to see an example of a ranch, location, property 
  attributes... but they guy noted there were privacy concerns... 
  over public information.
  ... the fact that people feel privacy issues related to public 
  info.... indicated some kind of issue
  ... scary what public information can be used to do
Samantha Mathews Chase: This is why a focus on reporting safety 
  information feels like a way in
  ... concerns over terrorism related to public oracles
  ... maybe terrorists will use public oracles
Samantha Mathews Chase: It's interesting to me that people find 
  this information dangerous, we have google earth lol
Heather Vescent:  Yes, open source intelligence is a concern... 
  people fear how public information might be used
  ... its not just privacy / security... its usability issue
Samantha Mathews Chase: @Orie, as in who can use it? or what do 
  you mena
Adrian Gropper:  Credentials don't all need to go in wallets
SamanthaMatthewsChase not sure what you mean?
Samantha Mathews Chase: Thanks everyone!!!! I so appreciate all 
  your brains.
Juan Caballero: :D
By all :)
Heather Vescent: @Orie_ thank you for scribing!!

Topic: Modeling VCs for education

Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit</a>#
  ... updates, context: building a document with the goal of 
  clarifying fitting existing schemas to the vc format
  ... document pulls together examples of best practices pilots
  ... we're an incubation org not a standards org, but we work 
  with the standards orgs to ensure we're going the correct 
  direction
  ... document outlines types of credentials people want to 
  create
  ... one interesting area is what to do with xml
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit#heading=h.t19npk98rich">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit#heading=h.t19npk98rich</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Example: 
  <a href="https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model/blob/master/XML%20Examples/Ildiko%20Mazar_Certificate%20of%20Excellence.xml">https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model/blob/master/XML%20Examples/Ildiko%20Mazar_Certificate%20of%20Excellence.xml</a>
  ... example 4 shows transcribing to json, but is currently in 
  xml
  ... why not as easy as just mapping to json, xml format for 
  conforming to European legal standards
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2020-07-21/#topic-3">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2020-07-21/#topic-3</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_vM55wQyJ5jiiD6ro3crCFIvC2TGxyZ8_B2t45RXFo/edit#slide=id.g8c7bea63ca_0_68">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_vM55wQyJ5jiiD6ro3crCFIvC2TGxyZ8_B2t45RXFo/edit#slide=id.g8c7bea63ca_0_68</a>
  ... may take months to year to get legal approval for json, 
  could just do xml to conform to current legal reqs
  ... we don't want to wait for legislature to allow other 
  signature suites
  ... extend vc data model to express support for xml mapping 
  including any necessary context needed in w3c
  ... credentials community group is the home for the vc data 
  model
  ... not a general recommendation for any group serializing xml
  ... a case by case decision, to make it easier for ppl with 
  strict xml requirements
Kim Hamilton Duffy: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES</a>
  ... hoping that changes from w3c will allow edci to continue 
  using xml formatted credentials
  ... as well as other groups such as scholarly publishing
  ... moving on to open discussion topics
  ... generalization of vocab, discussion of issuance roles and 
  impact,
  ... ler wrapper standardization
JimKelly_PESC: launched as ilr recommended practices, work is now 
  underway
Simone Ravaoli:  Ilr working group meeting thursday 11am eastern
  ... beginning base document for the workstream, build on w3c 
  work
  ... wrapper doc and doc we're discussing today
Nate Otto: @Kimhd I will join the audio stream for this meeting 
  then
  ... join call on thurs if you are interested
  ... will go through base doc and governance issues
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Will assume ieee is home for ler going 
  forward, and try to keep our docs up to date
  ... we are standards integration and getting pilots off the 
  ground
  ... ieee is more a combination of standardization (taking our 
  work as examples) as well as concerns around governance
  ... next discuss generalization of vocab
<a href="http://bit.ly/IEEE-ILR-WG">http://bit.ly/IEEE-ILR-WG</a>
  ... context, pilots want to work with the standard, but aren't 
  familiar with the existing work
Robbie Jones: I can see the agenda
Simone Ravaoli: Correction Agenda link for IEEE ILR - 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkcBk3qHEG5CnPXJp8c7Yt1KMdQ4Xx1tTl1LpFuRx5c/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkcBk3qHEG5CnPXJp8c7Yt1KMdQ4Xx1tTl1LpFuRx5c/edit</a>
Nate Otto: Catching up, we're on page 2 of this document: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit</a>
  ... want to integrate with existing standards groups like open 
  badges
Nate Otto:  There's a common pattern accross these groups
  ... defined credential or badge can be issued to multiple 
  people over time
  ... can we use a property across use cases
  ... "degree" seems limiting
  ... could use something like "badge" or invent something new
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  "Has achieved" seems like it fits well 
  across standards
  ... could compare ler
Kerri Lemoie:  Is this to say "has achieved this type of 
  credential"?
Nate Otto:  Not type, you could say has acchieved bachelors, but 
  we want to say has achieved bachelors of (subject) from 
  (institution)
  ... could also map to skills
Kerri Lemoie: CTID info: 
  <a href="https://credreg.net/registry/handbook#ctid">https://credreg.net/registry/handbook#ctid</a>
Jeanne Kitchens:  Ctid does not indicate a cred has been issued, 
  more like a unique product identifier
Nate Otto: I asserted "A credential has been assigned an ID by 
  Credential Engine" as the definition of "CTID"
Kerri Lemoie: +1 To bridge
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Credential engine also has a registry of 
  credential types, we're talking about helping bridge between 
  these registries and actual degrees
JimKelly_PESC: like "has achieved" as a generalization, but where 
  does it live? in the wrapper?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Vc itself is just the wrapper, ler/ilr is a 
  lot like this
  ... the terms and type definitions will likely live at the 
  standards body, this is the bridge
Nate Otto:  There's a separation of wrapper standard and payload 
  standard
  ... can use flexible range
  ... can we come up with a consistent way to represent across 
  standards
  ... could start by trying pilots with "has achieved"
  ... prove that this has value in the market then bring it to 
  the standards body that we are bridging in the pilot
  ... not forcing another standards body to adopt, but provide 
  open standard so they can
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Nate do you want to respond?
Tzviya Siegman:  Sounds like you allow other standards to 
  implement this so they can be compatible, that could be a heavy 
  lift
Nate Otto:  If we can prove the value of the approach the 
  standards may follow
  ... opportunity for standards bodies to align with wrapper and 
  payload to prove interoperability
  ... allow machine understanding of the credential
  ... learn enough to be able to get to machine understanding
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Nate I'll give you the floor to respond
Phil Archer:  Clarification, looks to be proper use of the 
  "extensions" property of badges
Nate Otto:  Don't think this quite "extensions"
  ... can duplicate data in properties to layer in w3c properties
  ... not enough to meaningfully validate
  ... probably could use the "extensions" but it's probably not 
  enough to do this
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Defining "has achieved" in open badges, we 
  could pass this along to them to see if they'd adopt
Tzviya Siegman:  In badging, issuing organization may not be the 
  same kind of organization as a credential, can we assert 
  accreditation by university?
Nate Otto:  Open badges infers that the definer of the achievment 
  is the only one who can issue
  ... there could be use cases for making more generic 
  achievments that can be issued by someone other than the creator
JimKelly_PESC: this feels like just one of many characteristics 
  that may be required for true interop
  ... could come up with a whole set that need to be shared 
  across payload specs
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  That's true, don't want to reinvent the 
  wheel
  ... use best practices from different standards bodies, would 
  love to just use an existing set of terms if they exist
  ... as a pilot group we have to id those and turn them over to 
  standards groups
  ... like proceeding with "has achieved"
  ... proposal: these are using json-ld, maintain a set of 
  work-in-progress schemas
  ... dcc has a playground for experimenting with creds, would 
  like to update that to point to examples from here
Nate Otto: Glad to hear some good support for has achieved. 
  Looking forward to working the action items. Action item could 
  be: make recommendations of vocabularies where hasAchieved could 
  be situated for good interoperability and community usage. 
  Develop JSON-LD-schema/JSON-schema is a good action item

  provider
I'll be happy to re-introduce - John Callahan Veridium CTO
Christopher Allen:  Good morning. Last time I talked with you, I 
  was a co-chair. Moving from an administrative talker to a doer.
  ... With Blockchain Commons
  ... Trying to create a basis under Wyoming law "what is 
  identity" that is able to express SSI principles
  ... Also trustless, self-sovereign identity solutions
Kaliya Young: Wondering are you actually working with actual 
  lawyers in the community? like Elizabeth R.
  ... BTCR was our baseline, but that hasn't kept up with BTC 
  innovations, so we are puzzling through how to leverage that
  ... along with peer-to-peer and newer bitcoin techniques 
  (meaning lightning and its kind)
  ... Putting head down to coding and working with coders. 
  Blockchain Commons
John_Callahan: I got by Jack, CTO of XXX. We have a new CEO, who 
  has recommited us to self-sovereign identity

  ... every week, chairs review the action items and try to see 
  how we can help, remove blockers, etc.

Topic: Progress on Action Items

Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/97">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/97</a>
  ... two issues today
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/88">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/88</a>
  ... Issue 97 is about hosting schemas
  ... For both 97 and 88 the conversation kind of snaked around a 
  little bit
  ... the main lurking issue seems to be uncertainty for 
  developers as they get exposed to JSON-LD
  ... Questions about how to construct contexts and where to host 
  them
  ... Orie proposed a way forward: to ensure that editors of any 
  CCG specs with JSON-LD are listed as contacts so when people have 
  JSON-LD issues, there is a list to ask for help
  ... Without a focused working group, it's not clear how best to 
  make progress, but listing contacts seems like a good start
Manu Sporny: +1 To the approach Orie is mentioning.
Orie Steele:  We don't have lots of time, so let's do something 
  simple
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The idea of designating some editors... this 
  is something the chairs can take on to figure out where such 
  information should go
  ... the only issue is whether or not there are strong 
  objections. If you are an editor and don't want to be contacted, 
  let us know. However, the better option is better documentations
Jonahtan_holt: I would welcome external experts to review. There 
  are schemas in from w3id.org inventing new things, or naming 
  things that don't exist
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  That's a good idea. Can you provide some 
  links?
  ... Since these aren't formal work items (they are issues). We 
  can just close these out with these resolutions.
  ... updating issue 97 now
  ... feel free to add comments
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Security vocab needs &gt;1 codeowner
  ... There were a few work items that got grandfathered in, but 
  they are missing code owners
Manu Sporny: +1 To Orie (Transmute) or Tobias (Mattr) being the 
  other code owners for all security-related things that don't have 
  two owners already.
  ... and only have one owner, which is not current process.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/146">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/146</a>
  ... so we'd like to get that fixed to current process
  ... Orie had proposed himself and Tobias
Manu Sporny:  +1 To that proposal (Orie &amp; Tobias)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Ok, this should be closable once we get that 
  noted
  ... next up, Heather to present
Heather Vescent: Deep Fakes, Digital Identity &amp; Democracy (aka 
  Hacking US elections using Maskirovka) 
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5iMLHESjyfB7aWeoX7LeO5JKmOR7aY8/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5iMLHESjyfB7aWeoX7LeO5JKmOR7aY8/view?usp=sharing</a>

Topic: Deep Fakes, Digital Identity &amp; Democracy (aka Hacking US elections using Maskirovka)

Heather Vescent:  Please let me know if you can't access that 
  presentation (it's a PDF)
  ... It might seem a bit random to present this information, but 
  there are reasons I think it is important
  ... What you should be doing is just sit back and take it all 
  in
  ... Many thanks to Anil John.
  ... He asked my team to look into securing election data
  ... Separatly an area of interest (for decades) has been 
  misinformation
Heather Vescent: Maskirovka
  ... Maskarovka
  ... goes into some more detail
  ... My experience with crafting narratives comes from my art 
  and culture jamming in the late 90s
  ... I organized a bunch of culture jamming that challenged 
  peoples views of what reality is
  ... not necessarily lie, but challenge thinking
  ... on of the "pranks" that we would do would be protesting
  ... the group would split into two subgroups: one for and one 
  against, to show the absurdity of the topic at hand
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5iMLHESjyfB7aWeoX7LeO5JKmOR7aY8/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5iMLHESjyfB7aWeoX7LeO5JKmOR7aY8/view?usp=sharing</a>
  ... That's my background and interest
  ... I've started to learn about the military use
  ... There is a currently a country really good at it and we are 
  under attack. And that is Russia. That is Maskarovka
  ... This is not just a technical problem, it's a social problem
  ... That is why I think this presentation will be interesting
  ... Illinois Voter Data Hack (details in slide deck)
  ... This was Russian hackers.
  ... They didn't just hack Illinois. They targeted all 50 
  states.
  ... As a result, $14 million was spent improving the system
  ... but the fixes didn't make the news, rather the hack is seen 
  as evidence our elections are out of control
  ... Identity in Elections (details in slide deck)
Juan Caballero: <a href="http://bit.ly/vdsreport">http://bit.ly/vdsreport</a>
Juan Caballero: ^Direct link
  ... Based on polling place, you get different ballots. So we 
  need to track personal information to support that
  ... Front End and Back End requirements for data use
  ... your name, personal information, can be bought and 
  campaigns can use those for reaching voters (through voter files)
  ... Attack Surfaces (details in slide deck)
  ... Technical + Social attacks
  ... Technical attacks (chart in slide deck)
  ... You are probably already thinking about how technology can 
  address technology attack surfaces
  ... the point of the report was not to use DIDs to solve these 
  problems, but rather "these are the problems. this is the 
  context"
  ... Technical attacks can lead to social attacks (chart in the 
  slide deck)
  ... Familiarity with voting systems is important
  ... With dozens of different ballots, this can become a problem
  ... This is one reason vote-by-mail can be so useful: it gives 
  people time to become familiar with the mechanism before 
  finalizing voting decisions
  ... Social fears about election resulted in increasing 
  technical security, but this doesn't directly shift public 
  perception of election validity
  ... There is a lot of sabotage going on
  ... Earlier this year, I wrote a book on espionage
  ... During WWII both US and Britain had the SOC and OSS, both 
  of which were created to sabotage the Nazis in Europe
  ... I had imagined that didn't happen any more. But in fact, I 
  was able to learn to recognize contemporary sabotage all around
  ... "Sorry, it's going to take 2 hours to vote because we only 
  have one voting machine"
  ... These are the ways our election system is vulnerable
  ... the primary attack here is social, not technical
  ... Maskirovka: to camouflage the truth (details in slide deck)
  ... While I'm talking about this in terms of Russia, both China 
  and the US do this as well
  ... in 2020 we have unlocked "entrepreneur mode"
  ... there is no directions from the Kremlin, but rather lots of 
  activities that may or may not have govt. involvement
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I'd be interested in having Heather come back 
  to do the rest on a future call
  ... more like startups looking for VC funding
Orie Steele: Report On The Investigation Into Russian 
  Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election - Volume I 
  (redacted): <a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf">https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf</a>
  ... Information operations in 8 steps (Bruce Schneier)
Manu Sporny: I'd also be interested in how we can apply some of 
  these learnings to how we design the technical specs...
Manu Sporny: That is, is there anything we can do to combat 1-8
  ... This is not a short term agenda
  ... This is about changing beliefs and shifting power
  ... Skip forward to "what can we do"
  ... We need to have technical and social solutions that work 
  together
  ... We need technical solutions on the platforms.
  ... Technical and Social suggestions in slide deck
  ... One thing I don't see talked about a lot is the need for 
  increased emotional resilience.
  ... If triggered, chill
  ... Democracies *are* at a disadvantage. Authoritarian regimes 
  don't have to follow data privacy rules.
  ... Realize you are a target. Yourself. Your company.
  ... that's it

  detection problem is the DeepTrustAlliance:

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Handing over to Manu
Manu Sporny:  That was super fascinating. thanks.

Topic: CBOR-LD

Juan Caballero: They've attended the last two IIWs, FWIW
  ... CBOR-LD
Manu Sporny: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/199svsHQXt2j1GqcvEXHgpENZIk1AZ53tEcUWuEYSsp4/edit">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/199svsHQXt2j1GqcvEXHgpENZIk1AZ53tEcUWuEYSsp4/edit</a>
  ... This is going to be a fairly simple, non-technical 
  interview
Manu Sporny: 
  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Aug/att-0018/CBOR-LD_Overview.pdf">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Aug/att-0018/CBOR-LD_Overview.pdf</a>
  ... There is a PDF as well as the google presentation
  ... This is a new data format that is meant to apply to VCs and 
  DIDs.
  ... CBOR = Concise Binary Object Representation
  ... the problem: documents are too big!
  ... For example, just presented a VC with your mobile phone, 
  using something like a QR code
  ... If we take a typical credential, ~1200 bytes. That's hard 
  to scan as a QR code
  ... In contrast, a 400 byte QR code is MUCH MUCH simpler and 
  easier to read
  ... If we can get our data sizes down to ~400 bytes a bunch of 
  offline use cases become possible
  ... The goal: figure out how to compress
  ... Slide 6 shows the compression magic of various approaches
  ... We were able to go from 1200 to 325 bytes. That gets us 
  below that magic 400 number
  ... So, if we want interactions off the network (arguably more 
  secure because of that), we have options
  ... we can get them to about 1/5 of the original size with 
  CBOR-LD
  ... This also matters *at scale*
  ... The storage of credentials for millions or billions of 
  people, every byte matters
  ... How does this work?
  ... This is dictionary compression.
  ... The dictionary lets you turn long strings into compact 
  representations
  ... You can build a compression dictionary from repetitions 
  within the document
  ... Turns out the @context for VCs works great as a compression 
  dictionary
  ... That's basically what CBOR-LD does: it uses the context to 
  create a compression dictionary and compress the documents
  ... This is typically far better than best-of-class binary 
  compression
  ... We also get additional benefits like btye-level semantic 
  processing, semantic processing over fixed data structures, 
  hardware optimizations, etc.
.. With that we'll stop, and pick this up in after hours
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you, Manu
Jonathon_holt: Where is this work being incubated?
Manu Sporny:  Digital bazaar right now. probably the JSON-LD 
  community group
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  After hours!
Manu Sporny:  New conference system
  ... you'll get a URL. We are going to disconnect everything 
  from this bridge
  ... please do NOT reconnect to the bridge we are on now
  ... We'll send URL. Disconnect. Then everyone connect at the 
  new URL
Kaliya Young: Good luck - I have another call :)
  ... This may be a disaster
Orie Steele: Smae
  ... We'll use IRC to track success while we try this out
  ... Everyone go ahead and disconnect.

<p>Foreward: This is the first post of a multi-part series where we will analyze the rise of nationalism in Europe and Asia and its implications on international cooperation for digital identity and citizenship. We’ll explore why Europe and Asia have undue influence on multi-national initiatives, and lay the foundational argument for why current challenges of identity in the digital revolution are better solved with international cooperation rather than at the individual country level. And lastly, this series will conclude with understanding why the United States’ failure to establish a federal approach to data privacy, and inability of its institutions to lead the international community towards a unilateral infrastructure of interoperable and secure digital identities is prolonging these challenges.</p>



<p>Part One</p>



<p>Last week, the European Union (EU) announced that it had revoked the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ecj-invalidated-the-eu-us-privacy-71770/">Privacy Shield</a>, a transatlantic agreement that enabled the legal transfer of data between the EU and the United States (U.S.). This landmark case is the latest example of the EU’s prioritization of individual data privacy and its willingness to pressure other countries, including close allies, to comply with data privacy mandates as a requirement to conduct business.</p>



<p>And the EU is not alone in regulating operating companies in how they handle, process, and maintain data. According to the United Nations, 132 of 194, or roughly 66&nbsp;<a href="https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DTL/STI_and_ICTs/ICT4D-Legislation/eCom-Data-Protection-Laws.aspx">percent</a>, of countries around the world have put laws in place to protect their citizen’s data. South and East Asia (including China), is another region following the trend of increased data protection and sovereignty laws.</p>



  



<p>Southeast Asia is the most rapidly growing region,<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/DA/WEO"> in terms of GDP</a>, in the world. Countries in this region recognize how attractive their large customer bases are to foreign investment. As a result, <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/data-localisation-southeast-asia">China, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam</a> have responded with data localization laws that prevent individual data from leaving their physical borders, and <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/01/24/amazon-web-services-to-build-data-centers-in-jakarta-minister.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Web%20Services%20(AWS)%20will,high%2Dranking%20official%20has%20said.">force companies to store data locally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, countries in this region are also introducing personal data privacy regulations. In May of this year, for example, the National People’s Congress introduced a draft data privacy bill to parliament that seeks to bolster the country’s formal position on individual privacy rights and protect valuable <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/land-big-data-china-sets-individual-privacy-rights-200526052444041.html#:~:text=China%20back%20to%20business%20as%20National%20People's%20Congress%20meets&amp;text=Data%20collectors%20have%20a%20duty,consent%2C%20according%20to%20the%20draft.">consumer data from being misused by foreign companies</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This demand for individual privacy rights in China was fueled by a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-lawmaking-privacy/in-land-of-big-data-china-sets-individual-privacy-rights-idUSKBN2320EF?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWmpNNE5XTmtNakpsT1RCaSIsInQiOiJJWWtkK1RLczVwMDBXajFTbHAwa2hcL0lCc1pzOTZYSGVod2FYQUJjNXpzdkd4Vk9ub2paVU5mUmZwT0kzZUJpYU1XWVluZitEY1JDcFFFb2pKNXZFblZxMG1kaG0yTkVINTM5a2FuQXl0SkNKOXk1Q0w5UnlWaE5JTjF0YWg4V0YifQ%3D%3D">2017 case where 42 people</a> sued Amazon for wrongful damages associated with a data breach from earlier that year. Yanming, one of the lawsuit participants, lost <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-lawmaking-privacy/in-land-of-big-data-china-sets-individual-privacy-rights-idUSKBN2320EF?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWmpNNE5XTmtNakpsT1RCaSIsInQiOiJJWWtkK1RLczVwMDBXajFTbHAwa2hcL0lCc1pzOTZYSGVod2FYQUJjNXpzdkd4Vk9ub2paVU5mUmZwT0kzZUJpYU1XWVluZitEY1JDcFFFb2pKNXZFblZxMG1kaG0yTkVINTM5a2FuQXl0SkNKOXk1Q0w5UnlWaE5JTjF0YWg4V0YifQ%3D%3D">247,000 Yuan</a> as part of an elaborate phishing scam that he fell victim to because assailants possessed his personal details. However, this lawsuit failed twice in Chinese courts because there was no precedent that established data privacy as a protected right.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>As we are moving into a world where data privacy and sovereignty regulations are the new norm, our OWI analysis identified both the positive and negative implications of our new reality.</p>



<p>On one hand, the advent of increased governance over technology providers has potential benefits. Countries are exerting more defensive barriers to stimulate growth of local businesses, while forcing foreign companies to protect and secure the personal data of their citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, digital identity is a challenge that is best solved through collaboration. When I started at OWI three years ago, our digital identity thesis was that private-sector products and services had developed in silos. This unfortunate series of events resulted in industry-specific identity products and services that were, for all intents and purposes, the same underlying process and technology with product marketing nuances that drove a false sense of differentiation. Our mission, to this day, is to try and break down those figurative walls and support the community in building products that made digital services more accessible for more people and, hopefully, less confusing in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of nationalism, manifesting through data privacy regulations, has the potential to stifle the international community’s headway towards a unilateral approach to digital identity, and reinforcing a siloed approach that many experts have been fighting so hard to rectify in the private sector. Should the world prioritize individual data privacy as a fundamental human right and prevent big tech monopolies from taking advantage of an individual’s personal information? Or should we prioritize interoperable digital identity solutions at the network or application layer of the internet to facilitate efficient access to goods and services across borders? Maybe there is a balance between the two? Stay tuned.</p>

   I think the best way that Me2B could help these kind of dialogues would be to demarcate between ‘things that I don’t want to happen around the sharing of my data’ (the defence), and ‘things that I do want to happen when sharing my data’ (the offence).

   I think the best way that Me2B could help these kind of dialogues would be to demarcate between ‘things that I don’t want to happen around the sharing of my data’ (the defence), and ‘things that I do want to happen when sharing my data’ (the offence).  <br>  The word and most of the conversations about privacy are really focused on the former; the defence. Privacy as a word is not well set up to deal with the things I do want to happen. Layer onto that, the information sharing is a fundamental human need that we cannot and should not try to avoid. What we need to do is that offence stack; ie when I want or have to share information (which is many times per day), how do I make sure that happens in a good way, rather than one which acts as a parasite on ones needs to share.  <br>  It is almost impossible to bridge the two major subject areas with the one word without losing the subtlety. In that respect, I for one rarely use the word ‘privacy’ if I can help it. That is also the reason why the original Kantara workgroup in our space was called ‘Information Sharing’; we wanted to build tools that enable information sharing to be done in a good way; as opposed to tools that would seek to prevent or limit sharing.  <br>  Hope that makes sense.  <br>  Apologies, I won’t make the Good Cops call today.  <br>  Iain&nbsp;  <br>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite,&nbsp;<a href="https://loginwithfido.com/">LoginWithFIDO.com</a>, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers.</p>



<p>As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers, and created a research report.</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s note: For the background information on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”&nbsp; To learn more about examples of proposed development ideas, please read the June blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-in-korea-learn-implement-phase/">2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Learn &amp; Implement Phase</a>.”</p>



<p>In the afternoon of July 1st, 2020, a Mid-Term Meetup Event for FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge was held at Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA). Originally, the Hackathon Steering Committee had planned a full-day onsite final implementation and evaluation day, followed by a month and a half online training phase.&nbsp; Due to the global pandemic, we had to change our schedules in accordance with school calendar disruptions and summer holidays. We decided to have a half-day mid-term meetup event for participants. This allowed us to help the teams to stay on course while providing a safe environment for people to learn from each other face-to-face.</p>







<p>Nineteen different teams participated in the event, half of them face-to-face with strict public health guidance applied, and the other half virtually. The meeting gave opportunities for teams to share their FIDO protocol-based online service development ideas and current development status, learn from each other and receive valuable feedback from FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members.</p>







<p>In addition to sharing their projects’ current development status, the teams had the opportunity to present the “homework” they have completed after online training.&nbsp; The homework was writing a simple article on the web, with answers to the following questions:</p>



  What is FIDO Alliance?  What are the FIDO protocols?  What are the benefits of implementing FIDO protocols?  (Option) What services/products are you developing for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon and what would be the value of adopting FIDO protocols for online authentication?  



<p>We were very pleased with the articles we received. You can read examples (mostly in Korean) by visiting these following links:</p>



  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeocw3/222029532562">No matter how passwords are complicated, they are not safe!&nbsp; Learn FIDO concepts</a>  <a href="https://pongdang-pooh.tistory.com/9">FIDO Authentication: Good security knowledge to learn while you are quarantined at home</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/owjs3901/222030081852">2020 FIDO Hackathon Homework – My Plan to Develop FIDO Based IoT Solution for Home</a>  <a href="https://blog.naver.com/lcwlyw/222032889174">FIDO – New technology standard to solve problems with IDs and Passwords&nbsp;</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/woojim11/222011830343">Let’s learn about FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  <a href="https://codstice.tistory.com/78">Summary on FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  



<p>We hope this short blog gives you a better understanding of the current status of the 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.&nbsp; We will be back soon with more updates after the final evaluation — scheduled for this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation has made a considerable investment in 2020 in transitioning the certification program’s conformance test suite to a single, Java-based system. The Financial-grade API (FAPI) tests have been Java-based since early 2019 and now we are preparing to finish transitioning the OpenID Connect tests to the Java-based conformance test suite on Monday, August 31, 2020, at which point we plan to decommission the existing Python-based conformance suite. See <a href="https://openid.net/certification/migration/">https://openid.net/certification/migration/</a> for details on the migration.</p>
<p>If you are currently testing your OpenID Connect implementations, please note this transition date and migrate your testing from the Python-based suite to the Java-based suite prior to that. If you are considering testing your OpenID Connect implementations, please include the transition date in your planning.</p>
<p>The transition to a single code base for the conformance test suite will enable the Foundation to more efficiently manage the program and add new profiles for testing. Thank you to those community members who have assisted in “testing the tests” and helping us reach this important milestone in the Certification Program’s history.</p>
<p>Please send any inquiries or issues encountered to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:certification@oidf.org">certification@oidf.org</a>&nbsp;and/or submit issues about the Java-based conformance suite at&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/issues">https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/issues</a>.</p>

 Overview 



<p>Over the past quarter, the Hyperledger Besu team has been hard at work improving performance across many fronts, from adding support for native encryption libraries to tuning our EVM execution code, experimenting with different different JVMs and building more robust benchmarking infrastructure. This has resulted in performance improvements across sync times, transactions per second and requests per second.<br><br>We are excited to share these results as well as the details of future work we have planned around stability and performance.&nbsp;</p>



 Native Encryption Libraries 



<p>When writing Hyperledger Besu (back when it was called Pantheon), we had a principle that the code had to be correct first. If the execution of a block was wrong, it didn’t matter how fast it was because we would fall out of consensus. Combine this with the complexity and specificity of encryption software, and any attempts to optimize performance could have a destructive effect on the whole project if we got even one corner case wrong.&nbsp; To avoid this, we used mostly pre-existing Java-based cryptography implementations.</p>



<p>Starting in Besu 1.4.2, we shifted our model to use external non-Java or “native” encryption (specifically, external libraries called through native OS calling conventions). This opened us up to a large swath of optimized implementations. The first library we added was secp256k1(AKA the Bitcoin Elliptic Curve). This library is heavily used throughout Ethereum, often invoked multiple times in each transaction. The implementation we use is Bitcoin Core’s optimized library (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1">https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1</a>). It is mostly written in C but also features a handwritten assembly loop in the “hottest” parts of the calculation. The second library we use is for the altbn128 curve, a precompiled contract that has seen a significant uptick in use as Eth2 testnets have started popping up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, Hyperledger Besu supports both the native versions and pure Java versions, so they are still usable if a native library isn’t compiled for your target device. We split these specific libraries out into a standalone package to simplify the process of building and packaging them for the various platforms on which they must run. They can be accessed on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native">https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native</a>).</p>



<p>This change has led to a noticeable speedup in fast syncing times (and transactions per second, but more on that below!), especially for networks where secp256k1 verification takes a significant part of the sync time, such as testnets or networks with lots of empty blocks. For example, this change reduced our fast sync time on Goerli by 13%, from 92 minutes (Besu 1.4.0) to 80 minutes (Besu 1.5 RC2). The full sync speedup (processing every transaction and storing every block state) was even larger: a 1,571% improvement, from just over six days (Besu 1.4.0) to just over nine hours (Besu 1.5.0)!</p>



 EVM Implementation Optimizations 



<p>Another place we improved performance is in our pure Java implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).&nbsp; There are three significant improvements of note:</p>



  We simplified our exceptional halt detection with simpler language constructs,&nbsp;  We flattened out a series of three calls into one call and removed a lot of duplicate calculations along the way, and&nbsp;  We adopted some low-level optimizations that we upstreamed to Apache Tuweni 1.1.  



<p>To determine where we needed to perform these optimizations, we used a combination of a handwritten tool and off-the-shelf profilers. The Besu community uses a mix of the VisualVM, Java Flight Recorder/Mission Control, and YourKit profilers (provided to Besu under their Open Source Licencing program – <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/README.md#special-thanks">https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/README.md#special-thanks</a>).</p>



<p>We then pointed those profilers at a tool we built called “EVMTool” <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/master/ethereum/evmtool">https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/master/ethereum/evmtool</a>) that was initially written to support cross-client fuzz testing of EVM smart contracts. With very slight modifications, we were able to turn it into a repeated EVM executor. Setting the repetitions up to an absurdly high number, we could point our profiler of choice at the EVM and get some longer term performance numbers. This revealed a large amount of unneeded copying of byte arrays, duplicate calculations, and inefficient call structures.</p>



<p>When compared to 1.4.2, our EVM evaluations (i.e., “gas per second”) have now improved from 78-220% depending on the specific contract structure and state size, with all but one benchmark showing over 100% improvement. While we don’t have raw measurements, we suspect this change is also partially responsible for the sync times improvements mentioned earlier.</p>



 GraalVM 



<p>Since Besu runs on top of Java, we have access to the full range of Java Virtual Machines.&nbsp; Previously, we have recommended OpenJDK 11 as it is a known and stable version of the JVM with many downstream distributions (Corretto, AdoptOpenJDK, Zulu).</p>



<p>Recently we’ve started testing with GraalVM (<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">https://www.graalvm.org/</a>), a JVM implementation that is Oracle’s successor to the HotSpot JVM that’s been at the core of Java for over two decades. It is also at the core of several new projects such as Micronaut and Quarkus. While it has lots of fancy features (such as Ruby support, experimental WASM support, native image generation, AOT compilation), it offers several significant performance advantages while remaining a drop in replacement for the JDK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just dropping in GraalVM Community Edition 20.1 without any additional JVM tuning resulted in a 14% increase in our TPS numbers, from roughly 350 to 400 smart contract calls per second.&nbsp; All the other fancy features it will bring along in the future is just icing on the cake.</p>



 Transactions Per Second (TPS) 



<p>As mentioned in the prior section, we have seen great improvement to Hyperledger Besu’s TPS numbers in a private chain setting. All in all, our efforts have moved us from 300 TPS on Besu 1.4.0 to 350 for Besu 1.5 and 400 TPS when&nbsp; using GraalVM. In order to get repeatable measurements for our TPS improvements, we worked with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/caliper">Hyperledger Caliper</a>, another project under the Hyperledger umbrella to benchmark our numbers across various Besu versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The network we used was composed of five nodes. Four of these were validators, and the only non-validator node was used as an RPC node. One of the validator nodes was designated for use as a bootnode.</p>



<p>The network used IBFT 2.0 as its consensus algorithm with a two second block time, an epoch length of 30,000, and a 10 second request timeout value. A very high block gas limit of 672,000,000 was set, and blocks were monitored to be sure that this gas limit was not saturated. The function called to benchmark TPS numbers was a “register” transaction from one of LACChain’s registry contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this was set up using Ansible playbooks we had developed to launch Besu instances.&nbsp;</p>



 Requests Per Second (RPS)&nbsp; 



<p>Another area where we saw notable improvements was in Hyperledger Besu’s handling of JSON RPC requests. Using ethspam (<a href="https://github.com/shazow/ethspam">https://github.com/shazow/ethspam</a>), a library that generates realistic read-only JSON RPC queries to bombard a node with, we saw an 64% improvement in Besu’s request-per-second performance. On version 1.4.0, when sent 100,000 requests, Besu could answer on average 5242.39 per second. Using the 1.5.0 release, that number was up to 8632.75. Even better results were obtained using GraalVM on Besu 1.5.0, with RPS reaching 8988.59, an increase of 71% over the 1.4.0 release!<br><br>For our RPS benchmarks, we used Versus (<a href="https://github.com/INFURA/versus">https://github.com/INFURA/versus</a>), a tool developed by Infura, which can compare the RPS performance across various Ethereum node implementations and, of course, Infura itself.&nbsp;</p>



 Stay Tuned 



<p>While the Hyperledger Besu team is pleased with the progress made, we are continuing to focus on performance and, over the coming months, will make it one of our main priorities for the codebase. Specifically, along with continuing to fine tune various parts of the codebase, we will begin major refactors of two areas of the codebase: the peer-to-peer (P2P) layer and the database.<br><br>Besu’s P2P layer has grown and been extended significantly over the past few releases with the addition of privacy, permissioning and various other improvements. It is now time to take a step back to redesign it so that it is maximally stable and performs well. We’ll also be looking to add even more new functionality, such as enabling the new eth/65 version of the eth networking protocol.<br><br>On the database side, the Ethereum mainnet’s growing state size has made database access reading and writing state&nbsp; a major performance bottleneck. Over the next few months, the Besu team will be experimenting with a new database format that is designed to be more performant for networks with large state sizes. The first “feature” coming out of this work should enable users to more easily backup and restore their network’s state, providing an offline disaster recovery backup.<br><br>Stay tuned!</p>

         <a>Hi all, bumping this thread because the deadline is next Monday, the 10th. In the GitHub issue, the work item owners have produced summary on how to quickly read and make sense of the text by outlining its structure and how it's relevant to our ecosystem.  If you'd like to contribute, please review the GitHub issue here:

</a><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/145">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/145</a>

If you have any relevant additions or take issue with the comments so far, you can also add a comment to the GitHub issue to make note of it. Please consider use of the excellent format Adrian has pioneered here, which can help contextualize how you should think about your comments:

<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/145#issuecomment-669415510">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/145#issuecomment-669415510</a>

Given the tight timeline and nature of _volunteer_ involvement, the goal here is not to cover every possible item to comment upon across the four documents, but rather it is to make salient points likely to make sense to the NIST reviewers and therefore update the text with an informed perspective on our ecosystem's work to keep the dialog open. Therefore, even if you take a modest lunch break to "hunt and peck" a few suggestions, it could matter a lot in our reaching of that goal.

Over the weekend, I will consolidate the responses more coherently, listing the Work Item owners and W3C CCG community at large as the authors by default. Please reach out directly over email to me or in the GH issue if you feel strongly about specific inclusion/exclusion of your name wrt the list of authors.

On Monday, August 10th, we plan to have the work item owners convene on Jitsi (along with anyone else who wants to join) to eliminate any contentious items and ensure consistent formatting/phrasing. Upon review and acceptance by the chairs, we will send the response to NIST. Big thanks to all the contributors for their additions to date, especially to the work item owners Nader, Ken, and Chris!

Best,

&gt;&gt; Please add a comment to the GitHub issue if you would like to be involved and contribute to this over the next 17 days. Feel free to reply to me directly if you want involvement but not publicly. I need a secondary co-owner to move things forward.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Nader, thanks for sharing to the list and for your well-written summary. I think it's important to engage governments to help them understand how technology based on our standards can help protect their citizens and to ensure that recommendations/regulatory requirements make room for or even encourage the adoption of global standards that are inclusively designed. When we don't do this, we run into difficult situations: for example, that the secp256k1 curve is not a NIST curve has caused a divide between enterprise and government usage of smart contract infrastructure. We have a chance to bridge chasms now.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be interested in collaborating with you to create a Work Item within CCG to synthesize the relevant parts of the guidelines, organize a community response, and coordinate guidance from those who have experience with providing impactful feedback to NIST over the next 19 days. If you're open in this approach, I would recommend proposing a new work item using this link:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am happy to then accept responsibility as a co-owner of this Proposed Work Item, which would help turn this into an official Work Item since we will have two different parties. You can read about the full process here:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit</a>#
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; We can have more than two owners on a Work Item, in case anyone else on this list is interested. Also Nader, please feel no obligation to take this on as your Work Item should your schedule or other commitments disallow. If no action in two days, I will make a new Proposed Work Item issue and bump this thread due to the short timeline, and invite participation to the GitHub issue.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It came to my attention that NIST is currently in an open review period on their Digital Identity Guidelines as published under NIST 800-63-3.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/4/draft">https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/4/draft</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Deadline: August 10
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They're seeking feedback on a wide variety of topics to improve the standard, including remote identity proofing, mitigating correlation, and biometric verification. The scope of these regulations is very broad and the open review period seems like a substantial opportunity to provide our input as a community on some practical, real-world identity regulations. I'm sure some of us have already started thinking about this, how might we get organized?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nader

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviewed Janelle Riki-Waaka, for an interesting discussion on the digital identity sphere.</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Janelle Riki-Waaka
<p>As Queen Whitney says, I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way! Cheesy I know but no truer words were spoken. I am so privileged to work with educators and support them in their professional learning needs.</p>
<p>Education systems world wide originated from the need to prepare kids for the workforce. In the industrial era this meant reflecting the work conditions they would eventually go into – large warehouses became classrooms and the smoko bell became the school bell. In terms of education for young girls, it was often crafted around antiquated expectations of a ‘woman’s work’. In terms of education for indigenous kids, this was primarily designed to assimilate them into the dominant culture. This practice was considered to be ‘in their best interests’ and would ensure a more ‘fair’ and just society for all. The education system wasn’t designed to empower indigenous kids to be deeply connected to their language, identity and culture and we are still feeling the ramifications of the trauma that this caused for indigenous people across the world. Until we actively start to redress that trauma, we will continue to experience inequity in its most harmful forms.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? It’s the responsibility I feel to be a voice for those indigenous kids who are continuing to experience inequity in our education system. It’s the understanding I have through my own learned experiences that our kids rely on us to be their allies, their advocates and their cheerleaders. They deserve to walk into schools and be empowered to be who and what they are and be secure in the knowledge that they are surrounded by adults who are working really hard to know better and do better.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Pure determination to prove people wrong! I hated the stereotypes about Māori women so becoming a single mother in my early 20’s lit a fire in me to push as hard as I could against those stereotypes and become more than what society expected of me. I worked really hard and I leaned into my support network. I read and learned and listened to people that inspired me and I set goals and just ticked them off one at a time. I went from a high school failure and a young single mother, to a self sufficient, empowered woman with a Masters Degree. At the start of my journey the degree was my aspiration and I was fuelled by wanting to prove a point. But the real reward for me was the self assurance that I could in fact achieve anything I dared to dream about.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Gosh so many! I think the most valuable lesson for me was to learn to trust my gut. Over the years I have come to realize that female intuition is probably the most powerful tool in our arsenal! I’m not referring to that little voice in our head that is most often our harshest critic, I’m talking about that gut feeling you get right when you need to get it! Looking back over things you can often remember a time when your gut warned you this was the wrong path. Or it screamed at you to just have faith. When things are tough in my world and I can’t see the wood for the trees, I always try to block out the noise and tune into my female intuition to allow it to guide me on my journey.</p>
 What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP considering only your learned perspective of what identity is. There are so many diverse definitions of identity and it’s important we don’t narrow the lens here. It would be dangerous to assume there is one definition of identity and even more dangerous to assume the western world view is the correct one! We need to allow diverse perspectives of identity to inform our practice for the future as one size will definitely not fit all and it’s too important to get wrong.</p>
<p>START educating people about digital identity. If you work in this space you might be forgiven for assuming everyone understands it but I assure you this is far from the case. Education should empower people to make informed choices and we must be careful not to educate through fear. We need to start to look at how we can educate our kids about their digital identity and integrate this important knowledge into school curriculum.</p>
<p>CONTINUE exploring alternative ways, processes and perspectives. You know what they say true collaboration is – it’s about the ideas that don’t exist until you get everyone in the room! So as you are continuing to explore innovative solutions to new emerging challenges ask yourselves this – who’s voice is missing in the conversation. And then go engage with those missing voices. They may just have the very solution you’ve been searching for.</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to allow diverse perspectives of identity to inform our practice for the future as one size will definitely not fit all and it’s too important to get wrong.</p></blockquote>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because everyone should feel important and valued for who they are.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>The Whale Rider is an amazing book by Witi Ihimaera and the film is phenomenal. It gives a great insight into the Māori culture and practices and it’s a go to for me when I need a reminder about having faith and trusting my intuition. It also explores a Māori perspective on identity and the importance of understanding indigenous world views and practices.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Have faith, be present and take it easy on yourself! You’re loved and strong and trust me, it’s all coming to you.</p>

I think Zoom was the first approach many of us considered when looking for a solution that would satisfy our needs because of its ease of installation and management. It is still an option under consideration until the decision is finalized, as our first priority is to have a running system that is workable for our meetings.

Personally I'm most excited about the potential to extend CCG Bot to facilitate work items, note-taking, and other conferencing functionality for our needs in an open and reusable way.

Best,

I'm attaching a screen shot of some stats from when we all tried to take
the new conferencing system down at the end of the call... for anyone
that's interested.

Our community server is in Northern Virginia, Azure data center. It is a
standard Azure B-series (B2s) 2 VCPU, 3.5GB RAM machine... which is
quite under powered.

We peaked at 80% CPU usage (but only on a single CPU) and 300MB/s in
total network output (everyone sharing their HD Video + HD Audio tends
to eat up a lot of bandwidth). CPU and network settled back down quickly
after the call. So, the system survived a concerted
videoconference-based attack. :)

Kerri did something that we were totally not expecting (which was
awesome!) and broadcasted a Hamilton soundtrack Youtube video to
everyone using a feature we had never tested before, which worked (many
of us hearing audio/video). It took down her browser but the rest of us
kept going. Juan had, hands down, the best use of flailing Muppet
arms[1] (guaranteed to increase network bandwidth usage significantly).

We discovered one bug with an unknown cause... at some point during the
call, the IRC-side started doubly transmitting all messages to the
Jitsi-side (XMPP). We'll look into that bug and get it fixed.

Overall, great success! Thanks to everyone for helping to test the new
system out.

If you had connection difficulties, things didn't work as expected, or
any other part of the experience was sub par, please let the rest of us
know (by responding to this email) so that we can track it.

Markus Sabadello:  Did resolution one of the oldest work items, 
  originally we were developing a seperate spec for did resolution 
  to be paired with did core data model and syntax... [scribe 
  assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... We wanted a spec that defined resolution... 
  resolution and dereferencing... scope has changed a bit since the 
  last DID WG F2F.... DID Core now covers parts of resolution.
Orie Steele: ... Did wg has added some parts of resolution to did 
  core... there is a section that defines inputs and outputs....
Orie Steele: ... We are also discussing representation of meta 
  data... the scope has shifted a bit...
Orie Steele: ... Did resolution spec work has slowed, but we have 
  updated to sync with developments in did wg
Orie Steele: ... For example how metadata is represented.
Orie Steele: ... Now we distinguish between resolution meta data, 
  and did document meta data...
Orie Steele: ... Matrix params have been removed, did params use 
  query strings...
Orie Steele: ... Did resolution spec will still be useful, but 
  some of it is now present in did core.
Orie Steele: ... Did resolution also covers resolver 
  architectures, hosted service vs local.... how is fragment 
  handled... can a resolver act a proxy for other resolvers.... how 
  is that reflected in meta data
Orie Steele: ... Trust in the resolver, architecture questsions, 
  how are did parameters being processed, etc.... did resolution 
  spec will continue to address these concerns
Orie Steele: ... Did core wg only covers the abstract interface.
Orie Steele: ... We have regular calls, switched to bi-weekly
Orie Steele: .... Link to the meeting page will be in IRC, happy 
  to answer questions

Orie Steele: ... Also they missed the dependecy lehman had on 
  AIG... and the gauruntees / exposure for lehman.
Orie Steele: ... The industry was asked to engauge with 
  regulators, and LEI was born as an ISO standards
Carla Casilli:  You will see on slide 4, ISO17442 [scribe assist 
  by Orie Steele]
Carla Casilli:  The code is stood up by reference data, legal 
  form, address... as well as relationships [scribe assist by Orie 
  Steele]
Orie Steele: ... All capped in the global system, which GLEIF 
  manages
Orie Steele: Gleif.org
Orie Steele: ... Free access for all users
Carla Casilli:  An LEI is assigned once, it stays with it for 
  life [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Historical data persists... historical data is 
  retained.
Orie Steele: ... Uniquely tied to financial services... but its 
  also used to identify firms, trusts, foundations, or individuals 
  activing in a business capacity
Orie Steele: ... We looked at how LEI can be useful in a digital 
  world for proving identity and digital transactions
Orie Steele: ... We looked at embeding the LEI to identify a 
  person at an org in a role, in standard X509
Orie Steele: ... Intially sovrin, evernym helped look at how LEI 
  could be leveraged in VCs
Orie Steele: ... We took the same use case, for regulatory filing 
  with a legal entity
Orie Steele: ... Like a financial report... tested with PoCs on 
  ethereum and hyperledger indy
Orie Steele: ... People act on behalf of an organization... 
  although these credentials are designed with schemas... we 
  designed these for public discoversability of employee 
  credentials
Orie Steele: ... For example, who is the CEO of org...
Orie Steele: ... We are doing more standards work with ISO to 
  cover langauges and roles ...
Orie Steele: ... GLEF stephan wolf, CEO of GLEIF, for example
Orie Steele: ... We put this credential in a wallet, and anchor 
  it to a blockchain
Orie Steele: ... We have the credentials in organization wallets, 
  person can engage in regulatory filings.
Orie Steele: ... We could expand these assignments for VCs in day 
  to day business as well.
Orie Steele: ... Slide 11, digitial identity chain of trust... we 
  take an identifer from a trusted network like sovrin, we take 
  that number, evaluate an certify LEIs, and VCs containing LEIs
Orie Steele: ... Also interested in extending to 3rd parties
Orie Steele: ... The digitial LEI will then issue another ... 
  (sorry)
Orie Steele: ... The org, person, the role... is the focus of the 
  credential
Orie Steele: ... We have an issuance chain, but also a 
  verification chain of trust all the way back to GLEIF
Orie Steele: Christoff: can everyon here me?
Orie Steele: ... Staring on slide 12... lets look at person 
  representing entity can benefit form VCs
Orie Steele: ... GLEF manages root of chain of trust, the LEI 
  issuers... next to that Digital LEI issuer, which fills out the 
  issuance to legal entities
Orie Steele: ... There are 2 roles, but they can be held by the 
  same organization
Orie Steele: ... 2 Roles can be combined but don't have to
Orie Steele: ... LEI user consumes LEIs and VC content
Orie Steele: ... Moving to slide 14
Orie Steele: ... Our PoC on sovrin... gleif receives s vc which 
  enables issuance, a digital lei issurer credential.
Orie Steele: ... Gives them certifiaction that they are part of 
  the system...
Orie Steele: ... The LEI issuer to an entity... paving the way 
  for a VC...
Orie Steele: ... Legal entity that has an LEI, cna request from 
  the digital lei issue a VC
Moses Ma: Carla and Christof, this is great work, do you have 
  contact information you can share? I'd like to ask a few specific 
  questions offline?
Orie Steele: ... Slide 18.... part fo this request is the digital 
  lei issuer requesting information for GLEIF system
Orie Steele: ... Verification and validation, 3rd party checks, 
  all important
Orie Steele: ... Moving on slide 19... Digital LEI issuer, can 
  issue to the legal entity... equiped with this, the legal entity 
  can now issue credentials to employees
Orie Steele: ... For internal or external use
Orie Steele: ... What are the benefits?
Orie Steele: ... If a person acting in a role of an entity, as a 
  credential which is linked to the entity, lots of powerful stuff 
  can be simplified.
Orie Steele: ... Purchasing related to businesses can be 
  supported by these VCs, onboarding, KYC....
Orie Steele: ... When you do business, you need to know and trust 
  your counter party
Orie Steele: ... Slie 21... specific public roles, like director 
  or officer of legal entity
Orie Steele: ... Usually these persons are already publically 
  discoveralbe
Orie Steele: .... A legal entity can report back the public 
  discoverable roles
Orie Steele: ... Digital lei issuer, can put this into global 
  public central registries
Orie Steele: ... Public information does not contain PII, or 
  company...
Orie Steele: ... You would see there is a CEO, not the name
Orie Steele: ... Data subjects must agree to disclosure
Orie Steele: ... Slide 24, global register
Orie Steele: ... Slide 25 covers use cases, business transactions 
  and regulatory reporting.
Orie Steele: ... In our PoC we covered real companies and 
  regulators
Orie Steele: ... Slide 26: on the GLEIF website, the complete LEI 
  data pool, we can add reported publically discoverable roles
Orie Steele: ... For example, CEO and financial analyst
Orie Steele: ... Allows a user to request more into, which allows 
  for additional discolsure... whihc leads back to the chain of 
  trust.
Orie Steele: ... We can heck the user, entity, issuer chain is 
  verified
Orie Steele: ... Slide 27 covers technical architecture, it was 
  easy... we created fully functional PoC.
Orie Steele: ... See issuance, request for verification, 
  leveraged exisitng building blocks, sovrin, hyperledger indy, we 
  leveraged VON network and BC GOV hyperledger indy based system 
  for state certificated
Orie Steele: ... We had help from everynm to put the bits 
  together
Orie Steele: ... Small integration layer, and application layer.
Orie Steele: ... We don't focus much on mobile apps, we focused 
  on desktop applications for the corportate use case.
Carla Casilli:  Thanks christoff.... so for use cases.. [scribe 
  assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... We summarized the ones we are seeingg, and 
  future PoCs
Orie Steele: ... 1. Focused on filers / reporter to regulators... 
  feedback from regulators was the use case could be expanded to 
  3rd party filers
Orie Steele: ... And auditors.. the flow would be extended.
Orie Steele: ... We see big potential into client onboarding and 
  kyc
Orie Steele: ... Trusted proof of who can sign / commit an 
  organization, as a client for onboarding...
Orie Steele: ... Further on, bring additional trust to KYC
Orie Steele: ... We also see huge applications for import / 
  export customs process for supply chain
Orie Steele: ... Both international and domestic supply chain 
  transactions with embedded LEIs
Orie Steele: ... Especially useful for working with VCs, 
  connected to the financial services... very helpfulf or supply 
  chain related payments.
Orie Steele: ... Also appliation for trusted supplier /provider 
  and member networks.
Orie Steele: ... Also payment providers where regulators are part 
  of the ecosystem...
Orie Steele: ... Sanction screening, anti-laundering and 
  counter-terrorism managment... all possible places where LEI 
  might help
Orie Steele: ... Business licenses... linking with international 
  identifiers..
Orie Steele: ... In order to share info and protect data... 
  especially in relation to things like GDPR
Orie Steele: ... Share relevant facts, support ZKPs...
Orie Steele: ... At the discresssion of the holder.
Orie Steele: ... Last oint...credential with LEI can be very 
  powerful.
Orie Steele: ... They can survive even changes to the reference 
  data that supports the LEI
Orie Steele: ...  Very helpful for organization identity
Orie Steele: ... Credential does not need to be revoked, because 
  of changes to reference data.
Carla Casilli:  Questions? [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Wayne Chang:  Lets go the q [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Manu Sporny:  Hey carla an christoff... great background... 
  curious about timeline. [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Seems like VCs are valuable to LEI... any 
  indiation of number of PoC / Pilots / Production systems?
Orie Steele: ... If its still years out, we would love to know 
  whats holding it up, challenges / features...
Carla Casilli:  We are in the middle of evaluating next steps for 
  GLEIF... [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... What role we should play moving forward...
Orie Steele: ... Closest to production is.... use case number 5, 
  payment remittance system.
Orie Steele: ... Its an existing ecosystem thats out there... our 
  PoC just adding an LEI to an existing production system
Orie Steele: ... Of course we are waiting for confirmation from 
  operators.
Orie Steele: ... Can't give you estimates... we keep finding more 
  interest.
Orie Steele: ... We joined Trust over IP as a contributor 
  member... evaluating the LEI as an ecosystem governance framework
Orie Steele: ... LEI as a solution to organizational identity in 
  digital transactions.
Orie Steele: Christoff: tech is not the gating factor, its 
  interoperability, many options in practice...
Orie Steele: ...  We don't want to make choices, we don't want to 
  exclude... so we go with several, or go with one and making it a 
  leading one
Orie Steele: ... This is why governance is important.
Heather Vescent:  Fascinatting space... can you talk about 
  trusted supplier use case, curious about supply chain, 
  auditing... re patagonia, certified fair trade... vs pharma 
  supply chain [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Carla Casilli:  We think it applies to both... [scribe assist by

<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.simbachain.com/">SIMBA Chain</a> was awarded one of the very first DARPA Small Business Innovation Research contracts for blockchain on secure messaging. Dr. Ian Taylor, our CTO, has spent years in distributed computing, but, at the time, Ian and I knew very little of blockchain. I had done some Bitcoin mining in the early years, but had no experience with smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the contract, Adam Brinckman, a senior research programmer at the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame, wrote the chaincode (the “smart contract”) for an application enabling military agencies to create military interdepartmental purchase requests (MIPR transactions) on a privately shared Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger for our project with DARPA. The goal of this project was to securely provide full traceability of all provisions as they were awarded through a very complicated procurement process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initial solution sought to take advantage of the tools provided by Hyperledger, which included&nbsp; Hyperledger Composer, an interface designed to help developers define assets written to the ledger. However, as we developed the application, we were challenged by the sheer complexity of the MIPR acquisition process. The numerous ways in which transactions could be modeled and the different ways each agency had defined MIPR assets presented major challenges. It would be difficult to capture the problem correctly using a written piece of chaincode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We realized quickly that we needed to build an auto-generated smart contract and API based on the assets and transactions to help simplify and capture this entire process. This proved to be a good solution for the challenges we faced. Over time, we developed this solution into a tool that would allow low code enthusiasts and business analysts to utilize blockchain and create adoption outside the normal community of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest is history. We went on, and continue, to build solutions for the Department of Energy, the United States Navy, Air Force, and USMC, all utilizing Hyperledger Fabric. Many of these solutions are around supply chain traceability, provenance, risk mitigation, sustainability, and lifecycle management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyperledger Fabric was the DLT platform of choice because it provides the following:</p>



  Open source!  Supply chain specific capabilities&nbsp;  High throughput  Permissioned membership  Scalability  Levels of trust  Data on a “need to know” basis  Rich queries  Architecture that supports plugins  Protection of keys and sensitive data  Integration with the Fabric EVM that allows us to write Solidity-based smart contracts  



<p>Our extensive work with Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts has given us the expertise to contribute back to the development effort. Adam recently collaborated with Fabric developers working on the Fabric EVM chaincode to fix a minor bug. The exact problem occurred when attempting to use the Fab3 proxy with web3 python libraries (web3.py). Unlike its JavaScript counterpart, web3.py enforces all input data to conform to Ethereum’s yellow paper specifications, and data returned by Fab3 was failing these validations. Fab3 isn’t the only service that fails these validations; Quorum and other private EVM implementations also fail validation due to the extra bytes they pack into transactions and blocks. Tapping into his experience as an Ethereum Solidity developer, Adam worked with Hyperledger’s development community to make Fab3 compatible with web3.py’s strict validation rules and added new regression tests to ensure that future releases remain compatible.</p>



<p>Adam also developed a <a href="https://info.simbachain.com/hubfs/User-Guide-Install-Hyperledger-Fabric-2.1-EVM.pdf">guide for deploying Fabric EVM onto Hyperledger Fabric v2.1</a>. The official documentation shows examples for installing Fabric EVM onto a 1.4 network so this guide will help developers transition their Fabric EVM chaincode as they begin to upgrade their network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a firm that has benefited from open source development of Hyperledger Fabric and other tools, we recognize the value of contributed code and expertise. We’ve been able to build Hyperledger-powered solutions that add the efficiency and effectiveness of key government services and want to help drive more open source innovation in the blockchain space. We encourage others to get involved. Check our this <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/CONTRIBUTING.html">guide to contributing to Hyperledger Fabric</a> or join <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric">#Fabric in the Hyperledger Chat</a> channel to talk to the maintainers about your needs and ideas and about how to get involved or suggest a feature or fix.&nbsp;</p>

         Hi W3C CCG,

We're getting very close to a new operational CCG Meeting System (with
video conferencing / screen sharing / high definition audio/video).

You can think of it as a cross between Zoom and the current CCG meeting
system. It's all open source + open standards-based while also being
compliant with accessibility and W3C Intellectual Property Release and
Recording requirements. W

         <a>Hi W3C CCG,

We're getting very close to a new operational CCG Meeting System (with
video conferencing / screen sharing / high definition audio/video).

You can think of it as a cross between Zoom and the current CCG meeting
system. It's all open source + open standards-based while also being
compliant with accessibility and W3C Intellectual Property Release and
Recording requirements. When fully operational, it will allow us to do
everything we can do with our existing system in addition to some of the
more modern things we've come to expect (like high definition audio,
video, and screen sharing).

It's close enough to take it for a test run at this point. So, as the
W3C CCG Chairs announced earlier today, we're going to do just that
during a W3C CCG after-hours call tomorrow.

Here's what is working so far with the new W3C CCG Meeting System:

1. Connecting via the Web: </a><a href="https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/weekly">https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/weekly</a>
2. Connecting via phone.
3. Web Chat (XMPP) &lt;-&gt; IRC bridging.
3. Rewritten ccgbot (manages queue, connections, etc.):
   <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/cgbot/tree/jitsi">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/cgbot/tree/jitsi</a>
4. Logging to log file, automatically accessible at all times.
5. HD Audio and screen sharing (up to HD 720p).
6. Bot autojoin/leave (fully automated, meeting admins don't have to run
   commands to get the bot to join or leave).
7. Unlimited ad-hoc meeting rooms (without bot/recording).
8. Two W3C Process managed meeting rooms (CCG weekly call, and CCG did-
   resolution call) with ability to add more via simple config file.
   VCEDU room on the way!
9. Admin interface (all rooms required a person trusted by the CCG to
   start the conference).
10. Fully open source / open standards running on infrastructure that
    this group controls.

What isn't working (yet):

1. Automatic screen recording and audio recording. It's halfway there
   and we probably shouldn't switch the regular calls over until it's in
   place.
2. Automatic transcription -- haven't tried yet... this is the dream,
   no more fallible human scribes, only the cold unfeeling transcription
   of an artificial neural network. We don't need this to switch over,
   but it's on the road map.
3. SIP dial-in -- don't know if we even want this now. All the
   backchannel communication is done via SIP, so it's doable, just
   need to put some time in to make it work. We don't need this to
   switch over.
4. Fully automated minute publishing and management to save Kim from
   having to manually publish each and every meeting we have.

So, the questions then become, do we want to move over to this new
system? Are the switching costs worth it? How much maintenance are we
expecting to have to put into this system? What is our backup plan?

In order to answer some of those questions, we need to test under load
to see if it will work for our weekly calls. We expect there to be bugs,
but nothing that can't be fixed fairly quickly.

If you have the time, please join us tomorrow to test out the system and
gather feedback from the W3C CCG community. :)

  Great points. <br>  Some of us here know people on the inside of CRM, CX, customer service and related corporate work—or are there ourselves. What I'm hearing from them is that these fields find themselves in a moment when, finally, they are beginning to realize that the B's need to engage Me's who are independently equipped to deal with B's at scale using tools and methods of their own.&nbsp;  <br>  The B's are also coming to realize that Push isn't enough, and that Pull isn't the whole story on the Me's side. There is also what happens&nbsp;after&nbsp;the sale. Which, by the way, is nearly all the experience we, as me's, have with what we buy. As Estaban Kolsky puts it, the customer journey isn't just one circular cycle. It's a figure-8: a buy cycle and an own cycle. And the latter is far larger, for all of us.&nbsp;  <br>  We visited this at some length on the ProjectVRM blog back in 2013, in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2013/07/13/turning-the-customer-journey-into-a-virtuous-cycle/">Turning the customer journey into a&nbsp;virtuous cycle</a>. As we see now, it was at least seven years ahead of its time.  <br>  But the time is now. Finally.&nbsp;  <br>  I think it is especially helpful, now that the time is here, to move past the selling frame where adtech and all the bad acting around personal information happens.  <br>  We're making a new future here, where Me's have new power and B's have new contexts and ways of relating to and respecting the Me's of the world. Let's model that, discuss that, organize that, certify that.&nbsp;  <br>  I'd say more but dinner awaits...  <br>  Doc  <br>  <br> <br>

 <br>
absolutely 100% SPOT ON<br>
<br>
Sadly it is more often true that corporate focus is on&nbsp;their sales process&nbsp;- scant thought given to a prospects&nbsp;buying process.&nbsp;As for the 'customer journeys' that they attempt to map out over and over again … they barely recognize that the prospect regularly ‘journies’ to places not under their control and not on their map.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile companies have sales and marketing&nbsp;‘targets'&nbsp;that need to be&nbsp;‘hit’&nbsp;when they&nbsp;‘attack’&nbsp;markets …. I should write a book on how aggressive language used&nbsp;internally&nbsp;by corporations&nbsp;&nbsp;in their customer facing departments will always hold them back as they try to communicate externally how the customers come first and that they want to work with us.<br>
<br>
If language used in public is so different to language use behind closed doors … which do you think best represent the values of that organization?<br>
<br>
Language leaks.<br>
<br>
… all of which continues to point to the fact that their understanding that a sale is an exchange or a mutually benefit deal will fall on lost ears.<br>
<br>
Language is important - and the continual use of the 'language of war' inside companies about how they are going to ‘attack’ a market … doesn’t augur well.<br>

 Milton, is your hypothesis about data? Or is it about information? 
 <br> 
 Information has been for sale for a long time. Wisdom has been for sale. Legal and medical advice have been for sale. 
 <br> 
 Nobody calls those offerings data, even though in the digital world they are built of data. 
 <br> 
 I think what you're talking about is information about ourselves. What are the markets for different kinds of information about ourselves, and our property? Who should be in those markets and how? How can any of us prevent the gathering of that information? 
 <br> 
 In the pre-digital world, we could containerize information into books, recordings, and agreements that advice be accepted in confidence. All of these forms were leaky in different ways—books xeroxed, recordings dubbed, secrets violated—but containerizing the information was still possible, and we relied on those containers because in the physical world leaking information took some work. You needed to make other containers of existing ones. 
 <br> 
 In the digital world, everything (we should have a word for every not-things) is comprised of data, which is binary math—ones and zeroes—and easily duplicated; especially since, as Kevin Kelly put it a decade ago, the Internet is a copy machine. This email you're reading is a copy of the one I'm writing. The effort and cost to make that copy is roughly zero. 
 <br> 
 This fact of digital existence has made gathering information about people simple and easy. And, since there are markets for information about people, it is easy to imagine ways of getting in on those markets. 
 <br> 
 But let's be clear that we're talking about information markets here. When we say "personal data" we are talking about personal information. Not just data. 
 <br> 
 There are lots of approaches to containerizing personal data into forms of useful information that are not easily leaked. Self-sovereign identity (SSI), for example, limits information leakage to what individuals—as sovereign sources—present as a verifiable credentials. It also formalizes what institutions (schools, banks, whatever) issue to individuals as credentials. 
 <br> 
 There are markets in that. A school might charge for a verifiable credential saying the student graduated from there, or that what the student presents to a recipient is a valid transcript of the student's performance at the school. But that market is one for information, not for data. 
 <br> 
 Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells are not data. They are physical cells that contain useful information of value to science and—rightfully—to her heirs. Calling those cells data alone ignores their nature as physical things and as containers of useful information that has both moral and transactional value. 
 <br> 
 So, to sum up, I think we're on more solid ground if we're talking about information rather than data. 
 <br> 
 Doc

 Hi Milton, 
 &nbsp; 
 Your sharing of this article and your earlier thread suggest that you view data as a type of property.&nbsp; The Me2B Alliance does not support the idea that data is a type of property.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 Also, from the Me2BA organizational perspective, we are not advocating for or supporting the direct selling by individuals of (a) data, (b) information, or even (c) rights to data or information. 
 &nbsp; 
 I recognize that there is much movement [globally] in and around the idea of data markets, data economies, data dividends, etc.&nbsp; Our position may evolve over time as system modeling and research evolves around “personal data markets”, but it’s not a part of the current ethos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</a><a href="https://forms.gle/SkAmGFpZLZngMi5k8">https://forms.gle/SkAmGFpZLZngMi5k8</a>

We are also ranking these endpoints by how important people feel they are
to interoperability and adoption.

We have made space on the survey to name up to 3 additional types of
service endpoints you are important to DIDs.

Our goal is to get at least 20 responses from community members. This group
was formed at IIW29 and chose to nest at DIF but is seeking broad input
from all the different groups in the community.  Please feel free to pass
this link along to anyone you think might have constructive input.

<p>As we pointed out in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/07/31/iot-deployment-tutorial-part-i-deploying-hyperledger-besu-to-support-hardware-layer">part I of this series</a>, the days when hardware and software were separate entities are long gone. Along with the ongoing worldwide digitization and digitalization, the integration between the virtual and physical worlds is getting stronger – making the Internet of Things (IoT) a real thing. Going further, we can leverage blockchain features like data immutability, distributed character, and exploit the smart contracts it offers to connect it with IoT applications to build a trusted and all-inclusive solution. We’ve created a two-part tutorial to showcase how to deploy and connect all the pieces. In <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Deployment+of+Private+Hyperledger+Besu+on+AWS+with+hardware+layer+for+Externally+Owned+Account">part I of our tutorial</a>, we set up a private Hyperledger Besu network and configured a Raspberry Pi to sign transactions with its own keys. We used this to write a Python program, hosted on Raspberry, sending Ether to other participants of the network. The final solution used quite a broad technological stack: Terraform, Amazon Web Services, MetaMask, and, finally, Raspberry Pi. In <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Ratified+Smart+Contract+for+Constrained+Delivery+with+Oraclized+Data">part II</a>, we don’t want to lower the bar, so here we add some extra technological stack on the top of what we had.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Scenario&nbsp; 



<p>Let us consider a contract between a supplier and a buyer. They both agree on some delivery time, conditions, pick up and drop off locations, and, of course, the price the buyer is willing to pay. Among the conditions, they can agree on some penalty for delayed delivery or that the parcel couldn’t be exposed to a temperature higher than some threshold longer than X minutes. While the delivery time can be verified, the monitoring of the second condition is not that easy to verify. Even if we suspect that the temperature threshold has been exceeded (because, for example, the delivered food is spoiled), how can we prove that transport conditions were inappropriate?</p>



<p>In part II, <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Ratified+Smart+Contract+for+Constrained+Delivery+with+Oraclized+Data">Ratified Smart Contract for Constrained Delivery with Oraclized Data</a>, we created an automated solution covering the entire supply process, including:</p>



  publishing the delivery offer with specified conditions,&nbsp;  acceptance of the conditions by contractor,&nbsp;  starting the delivery by an authorized person (using personalized hardware signature),&nbsp;  monitoring the delivery temperature and contract voiding conditions, confirming the delivery, and&nbsp;  calculating the final payment for the supplier.&nbsp;  



<p>To achieve this, we take advantage of the Hyperledger Besu network that was deployed in part I and now write a smart contract on the top of it that handles the delivery operations.</p>



 Overview 



<p>In the full tutorial, we detail all the steps to designing a smart contract for the presented delivery use case. To do this, we use web-based Remix IDE as an environment for contract development while the contract itself is written in the Vyper language. We opted for this pythonic language for the simplicity and readability of its code. Once the contract is developed, we show how to test the deployment to verify that all the functionalities are working correctly.</p>



<p>Further, we go through the steps required to use the hardware signature (contained in the smart card) to sign the transaction, to configure the temperature sensor and measure the current value of the temperature, and, finally, to integrate all the parts into one program that will serve as “delivery starter” and “temperature measurement provider.”</p>



<p>Our tutorial covers a very concrete use case, and it is only the tip of the iceberg. There’s much more, and the possibilities are endless. We hope that this tutorial will give you the thrill to build your own blockchain application. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us!</p>

 To Cam’s point the Alliance has to be the catalyst for a tectonic shift only felt by a Super Volcano, problem is we’ve never felt one before,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-a-supervolcano-what-a-supereruption?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products">Taupo</a>&nbsp;the

 Hi All, 
 <br>
 
 Following this thread closely.... 
 <br>
 
 Ask a kid in America with their own smart what their data is, they are likely to say it’s all my app activity when not connected to Wi-Fi. It’s not my texts, except when I share videos or pictures. And it’s
 not my voice calls when my mom calls me, but it’s probably my FaceTime.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 The wireless carriers have habituated over 200 million people in the US on the definition of the word data.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 Now sure that data is made into math to flow through the network per Doc’s comment, but in the kid’s mind it’s likely to be the pictures, videos, likes, game scores, product views and app purchases, etc.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 Can we agree that data itself is a loaded word and it’s meaning is in the eye of the beholder?&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 Having got to know each of you on this thread in varying degrees over the last year, there is way more common ground here than any need to fuss over the 4-letter word...data.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 What this thread shows me is we all have work to do to get to a shared understating of how the word — data — will shift in context.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 It will shape-shift between writer and reader, speaker and listener.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 Let’s be diligent in our empathy.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 Cheers...Cam

 Data tends to be specific to an individual. Information (in the sense of cleaned and categorized data) can still be about an individual or not. Knowledge, is derived from information but no longer linked to the specific data of one
 or more individuals.&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 HeLa cells have contributed immensely to medical knowledge. Has that knowledge harmed Lacks or her relatives in some&nbsp;way? Maybe, but I’m not sure how. The problem is that Lacks’ data was processed without consent as is the data from
 all of us when it is processed through surveillance capitalism.&nbsp; 
 
 <br>
 
 Processing data without informed consent, even if anonymized, is a taking and needs to be illegal. Informing Lacks or us today of the implications, good and bad, of processing our personal data is almost impossible but we have to try.&nbsp;

 Milton, is your hypothesis about data? Or is it about information? 
 <br>
 
 Information has been for sale for a long time. Wisdom has been for sale. Legal and medical advice have been for sale. 
 <br>
 
 Nobody calls those offerings data, even though in the digital world they are built of data. 
 <br>
 
 I think what you're talking about is information about ourselves. What are the markets for different kinds of information about ourselves, and our property? Who should be in those markets and how? How can any of us prevent the gathering of that
 information? 
 <br>
 
 In the pre-digital world, we could containerize information into books, recordings, and agreements that advice be accepted in confidence. All of these forms were leaky in different ways—books xeroxed, recordings dubbed, secrets violated—but containerizing
 the information was still possible, and we relied on those containers because in the physical world leaking information took some work. You needed to make other containers of existing ones. 
 <br>
 
 In the digital world, everything (we should have a word for every not-things) is comprised of data, which is binary math—ones and zeroes—and easily duplicated; especially since, as Kevin Kelly put it a decade ago, the Internet is a copy machine.
 This email you're reading is a copy of the one I'm writing. The effort and cost to make that copy is roughly zero. 
 <br>
 
 This fact of digital existence has made gathering information about people simple and easy. And, since there are markets for information about people, it is easy to imagine ways of getting in on those markets. 
 <br>
 
 But let's be clear that we're talking about information markets here. When we say "personal data" we are talking about personal information. Not just data. 
 <br>
 
 There are lots of approaches to containerizing personal data into forms of useful information that are not easily leaked. Self-sovereign identity (SSI), for example, limits information leakage to what individuals—as sovereign sources—present as
 a verifiable credentials. It also formalizes what institutions (schools, banks, whatever) issue to individuals as credentials. 
 <br>
 
 There are markets in that. A school might charge for a verifiable credential saying the student graduated from there, or that what the student presents to a recipient is a valid transcript of the student's performance at the school. But that market
 is one for information, not for data. 
 <br>
 
 Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells are not data. They are physical cells that contain useful information of value to science and—rightfully—to her heirs. Calling those cells data alone ignores their nature as physical things and as containers of useful
 information that has both moral and transactional value. 
 <br>
 
 So, to sum up, I think we're on more solid ground if we're talking about information rather than data. 
 <br>

 Hi Milton,&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 I didn’t mean to imply that you should withdraw.&nbsp; I felt it was important to be clear about the current Me2BA position. 
 &nbsp; 
 I appreciate diversity of opinion—it forces one to keep thinking, keep open.&nbsp; I also think it’s valuable to model how people with different points of view can coexist and respectfully debate.

 I respect that. Does that mean that because I have a different view of data that I should withdraw ? I will abide by your decision since it’s your organization.&nbsp;

 Hi Milton, 
 &nbsp; 
 Your sharing of this article and your earlier thread suggest that you view data as a type of property.&nbsp; The Me2B Alliance does not support the idea that data is a type of property.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 Also, from the Me2BA organizational perspective, we are not advocating for or supporting the direct selling by individuals of (a) data, (b) information, or even (c) rights to data or information. 
 &nbsp; 
 I recognize that there is much movement [globally] in and around the idea of data markets, data economies, data dividends, etc.&nbsp; Our position may evolve over time as system modeling and research evolves around “personal
 data markets”, but it’s not a part of the current ethos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Data tends to be specific to an individual. Information (in the sense of cleaned and categorized data) can still be about an individual or not. Knowledge, is derived from information but no longer linked to the specific data of one or more individuals.&nbsp;  <br>  HeLa cells have contributed immensely to medical knowledge. Has that knowledge harmed Lacks or her relatives in some&nbsp;way? Maybe, but I’m not sure how. The problem is that Lacks’ data was processed without consent as is the data from all of us when it is processed through surveillance capitalism.&nbsp;   <br>  Processing data without informed consent, even if anonymized, is a taking and needs to be illegal. Informing Lacks or us today of the implications, good and bad, of processing our personal data is almost impossible but we have to try.&nbsp;  <br>  - Adrian&nbsp;  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

   Milton, is your hypothesis about data? Or is it about information?  <br>  Information has been for sale for a long time. Wisdom has been for sale. Legal and medical advice have been for sale.  <br>  Nobody calls those offerings data, even though in the digital world they are built of data.  <br>  I think what you're talking about is information about ourselves. What are the markets for different kinds of information about ourselves, and our property? Who should be in those markets and how? How can any of us prevent the gathering of that information?  <br>  In the pre-digital world, we could containerize information into books, recordings, and agreements that advice be accepted in confidence. All of these forms were leaky in different ways—books xeroxed, recordings dubbed, secrets violated—but containerizing the information was still possible, and we relied on those containers because in the physical world leaking information took some work. You needed to make other containers of existing ones.  <br>  In the digital world, everything (we should have a word for every not-things) is comprised of data, which is binary math—ones and zeroes—and easily duplicated; especially since, as Kevin Kelly put it a decade ago, the Internet is a copy machine. This email you're reading is a copy of the one I'm writing. The effort and cost to make that copy is roughly zero.  <br>  This fact of digital existence has made gathering information about people simple and easy. And, since there are markets for information about people, it is easy to imagine ways of getting in on those markets.  <br>  But let's be clear that we're talking about information markets here. When we say "personal data" we are talking about personal information. Not just data.  <br>  There are lots of approaches to containerizing personal data into forms of useful information that are not easily leaked. Self-sovereign identity (SSI), for example, limits information leakage to what individuals—as sovereign sources—present as a verifiable credentials. It also formalizes what institutions (schools, banks, whatever) issue to individuals as credentials.  <br>  There are markets in that. A school might charge for a verifiable credential saying the student graduated from there, or that what the student presents to a recipient is a valid transcript of the student's performance at the school. But that market is one for information, not for data.  <br>  Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells are not data. They are physical cells that contain useful information of value to science and—rightfully—to her heirs. Calling those cells data alone ignores their nature as physical things and as containers of useful information that has both moral and transactional value.  <br>  So, to sum up, I think we're on more solid ground if we're talking about information rather than data.  <br>  Doc  <br>   <br>

A verifier, i.e. the software that verifies credentials on behalf of some party, does not determine by itself whether or not to trust an issuer or an accreditation. It needs to get instructions about making such decisions from the party (individual, organization) on whose behalf it works. This party, who can make such decisions by itself, isn't going to inspect every VC in every transaction to decide this. It has bought/hired the software to do that for him. What the party should do is provide a policy to that software can use to make such decisions in every appropriate case (i.e.: a party may decide to accept an id-credential that has expired for a few months/years if the tranasction in which it is used has no/low risk) . according to which it can make such determinations, along the lines of what  daniel.hardman@evernym.com&gt; @<a href="mailto:daniel.hardman@evernym.com?Subject=RE%3A%20A%20question%20on%20best%20practices%20for%20dependent%20claims&amp;In-Reply-To=%3C099301d66801%2486b408d0%24941c1a70%24%40gmail.com%3E&amp;References=%3C099301d66801%2486b408d0%24941c1a70%24%40gmail.com%3E">daniel.hardman@evernym.com</a> describes. 

 

This means that the party has to come up with a set of rules by which

*	the software can distinguish between various contexts
*	for every context: what kinds of credential types are acceptable (contain fields the data of which are useable) , and what makes such credentials acceptable/trustworthy/valid/... 

I do not see there is a way around that.

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

… upon further refection.

Having a verification process that checks the issuer of a VC so the verifier can determine if they trust them, 

and if they do not then checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified the issuer so the verifier can determine if they trust them

                and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified them, etc.

 

Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.

 

Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

Aries RFC 0430 ( &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt; "Machine Readable Governance Frameworks") contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip 

 

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

 

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu &lt;<a href="http://lightest.eu">http://lightest.eu</a>&gt;  or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

 

For example:

*	Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
*	Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
*	Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
*	A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
*	DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
*	Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification. 
*	Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
*	Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

*	Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
*	Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
*	And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

*	If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
*	Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
*	Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
*	and so on...

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 

 

Thanks in advance!

A verifier, i.e. the software that verifies credentials on behalf of some party, does not determine by itself whether or not to trust an issuer or an accreditation. It needs to get instructions about making such decisions from the party (individual, organization) on whose behalf it works. This party, who can make such decisions by itself, isn't going to inspect every VC in every transaction to decide this. It has bought/hired the software to do that for him. What the party should do is provide a policy to that software can use to make such decisions in every appropriate case (i.e.: a party may decide to accept an id-credential that has expired for a few months/years if the tranasction in which it is used has no/low risk) . according to which it can make such determinations, along the lines of what @<a href="mailto:daniel.hardman@evernym.com?Subject=Re%3A%20A%20question%20on%20best%20practices%20for%20dependent%20claims&amp;In-Reply-To=%3C6725872A-8398-4FD6-9DC9-7D860D17142A%40gmail.com%3E&amp;References=%3C6725872A-8398-4FD6-9DC9-7D860D17142A%40gmail.com%3E">daniel.hardman@evernym.com</a> describes.
&gt;  
&gt; This means that the party has to come up with a set of rules by which
&gt; the software can distinguish between various contexts
&gt; for every context: what kinds of credential types are acceptable (contain fields the data of which are useable) , and what makes such credentials acceptable/trustworthy/valid/...
&gt; I do not see there is a way around that.
&gt;  
&gt; It may be worthwhile to look at use-case (UC-00) of the CCI project. It proposes the concept of a Local Assurance Community (LAC) and are drafting requirements for an associated Toolbox. The Appendix of the toolbox proposes a way by which a VC can be checked for accreditation of the issuer.

&gt; Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;  
&gt; … upon further refection.
&gt; Having a verification process that checks the issuer of a VC so the verifier can determine if they trust them,
&gt; and if they do not then checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified the issuer so the verifier can determine if they trust them
&gt;                 and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified them, etc.
&gt;  
&gt; Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.
&gt;  
&gt; Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

&gt; Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;  
&gt; Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

&gt; Subject: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;  
&gt; Aries RFC 0430 ("Machine Readable Governance Frameworks") contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.
&gt; 
&gt; The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

&gt; Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

&gt; Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip

&gt; “ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”
&gt;  
&gt; It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.
&gt;  
&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;  
&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt; Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;  
&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;  
&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;  
&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;  
&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;  
&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.
&gt;  
&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.
&gt;  
&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.
&gt;  
&gt; Best,
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  
&gt;  
&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;  
&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)
&gt;  
&gt; kind regards,
&gt; steve

&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;  
&gt; For example:
&gt; Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt; Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt; Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
&gt; A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
&gt; DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt; Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt; Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
&gt; Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.
&gt;  
&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;  
&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;  
&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?
&gt;

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt; Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt; Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt; And there are hundreds of others....
&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt; If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt; Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
&gt; Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
&gt; and so on...
&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks in advance!

It needs to get instructions about making such decisions from the party (individual, organization) on whose behalf it works. This party, who can make such decisions by itself, isn't going to inspect every VC in every transaction to decide this. It has bought/hired the software to do that for him. What the party should do is provide a policy to that software can use to make such decisions in every appropriate case (i.e.: a party may decide to accept an id-credential that has expired for a few months/years if the tranasction in which it is used has no/low risk) . according to which it can make such determinations, along the lines of what @<a href="mailto:daniel.hardman@evernym.com?Subject=RE%3A%20A%20question%20on%20best%20practices%20for%20dependent%20claims&amp;In-Reply-To=%3C1d21fd91f4ad41139937c8b6e440d571%40tno.nl%3E&amp;References=%3C1d21fd91f4ad41139937c8b6e440d571%40tno.nl%3E">daniel.hardman@evernym.com</a>daniel.hardman@evernym.com&gt; describes.

This means that the party has to come up with a set of rules by which

  *   the software can distinguish between various contexts
  *   for every context: what kinds of credential types are acceptable (contain fields the data of which are useable) , and what makes such credentials acceptable/trustworthy/valid/...

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

… upon further refection.
Having a verification process that checks the issuer of a VC so the verifier can determine if they trust them,
and if they do not then checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified the issuer so the verifier can determine if they trust them
                and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified them, etc.

Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.

Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

Aries RFC 0430 ("Machine Readable Governance Frameworks")&lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt; contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

Subject: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

Dear Steve, all,

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu&lt;<a href="http://lightest.eu">http://lightest.eu</a>&gt; or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

Best,

--luca

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

kind regards,
steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

For example:

  *   Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
  *   Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
  *   Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
  *   A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
  *   DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
  *   Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
  *   Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
  *   Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

  *   Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
  *   Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
  *   And there are hundreds of others....
Some initial thinking

  *   If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
  *   Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
  *   Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof.
  *   and so on...
Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.

Thanks in advance!

&gt; *Subject:* Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; just to give you a feel for the scale of this "edge case" issue.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The world bank together with partner UN agencies maintain statistics on a
&gt; thing called the "cost of trade"-  its complex stuff but can be simplified
&gt; to roughly the ratio of price of the thing at the warehouse door of the
&gt; distributor in an importing nation - over the price of the same thing at
&gt; factory door of the producer in the exporting nation. So, for example, the
&gt; cost of trade would be 100% if you can buy a sack of potatoes at the farm
&gt; gate in USA for $10 but the same sack of potatoes costs $20 from the
&gt; distributor warehouse in china (for the example of potatoes exported from
&gt; Us to china).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Globally the average cost of trade between all nations hovers at around
&gt; 90% for manufactured goods and 150% for agricultural goods.  Obviously it's
&gt; a super-critical number when reduced to specific bilateral pathways because
&gt; it has a huge impact on the relative competitiveness of national produce in
&gt; export markets.  For example is USA-CN cost of trade is 120% but EU-china
&gt; cost of trade is 80% then EU producers are significantly advangated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; the (very) interesting question is - how does this 100% average cost of
&gt; trade break down?  where are these costs?  Of course the answer is specific
&gt; to particular trade lanes but on average it's something like:
&gt;
&gt;    - 40% is distributor markup (ie profit int he supply chain)
&gt;    - 30% is the actual cost of transport
&gt;    - 30% is border costs.
&gt;
&gt; what is even more interesting is that, of that 30% border costs, on
&gt; average, only around 10% is duty.  So the other 20% are "non-tariff
&gt; barriers" like the paper certificates I described.  Now when you realise
&gt; that international trade accounts for around 20% of world GDP then this 20%
&gt; is a LOT.  world GDP currently stands at $80Tn USD.  So international trade
&gt; is maybe a bit under $20Tn (including the cost of trade).  So these
&gt; non-tariff border costs add up to at least $1Trillion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; not an edge case I think....
&gt;

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably
&gt; already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to
&gt; go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not"
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My main use cases are in international trade and specifically where the
&gt; issuer is in the exporting country and the verifier is in the importing
&gt; country.  And pretty much ALL of my use cases are therefore of the "very
&gt; specific" kind that you indicate may be an unusual edge-case.  My view is
&gt; that they are certainly not unusual - they are an every day occurrence at
&gt; volumes that make your eyes water.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For example - lets get specific with two very common kinds of certificates.
&gt;
&gt;    - A "preferential certificate or origin" is a document issued by an
&gt;    authorised body in the exporting country (in USA, one of 7000 chambers of
&gt;    commerce) that attests that the goods in a specific shipment (identified
&gt;    with a consignment number and/or invoice number) conform to the terms of
&gt;    free trade agreement.  Crucially, the verifier is  the customs authority in
&gt;    the importing country who will decide whether they believe the (currently
&gt;    mostly paper / wet seal) certificate is valid. If so then the importer is
&gt;    granted preferential duty rates.  Note that a certificate of origin must
&gt;    accompany EVERY shipment.  It's not a multiple use license, it is a single
&gt;    use certificate.  Obviously there are literally millions of them issued
&gt;    every day around the world.  They are a burden (is a non-tariff barrier) on
&gt;    trade.
&gt;    - A "phytosanitary certificate" is a document issued by an accredited
&gt;    person (a qualified food health inspector) in the exporting country that
&gt;    attests that the plant material (there are different certificates for
&gt;    animal products) meet the quality criteria of the importing jurisdiction.
&gt;    There are complex rules maintained by most exporting nations about exactly
&gt;    what kind of phyto certificate is needed by which country for which
&gt;    category of plant based material.  Just search through this for a bit to
&gt;    see what I mean -
&gt;    <a href="https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx">https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx</a>.  that's
&gt;    just for plants - there are five other categories.  The actual certificates
&gt;    are issued by accredited persons - in Australia they are called "Australian
&gt;    Authorised Officers" - to become one, you go through this process
&gt;    <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao</a>.
&gt;    there are around 700 officers in australia. The department maintains a list
&gt;    of accredited officers at
&gt;    <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register</a> as
&gt;    a set of state level pdf documents.  Like certificates of origin,
&gt;    phytosanitary certificates are single use and so there are also millions
&gt;    issued all the time and they also present a non-tariff barrier to trade and
&gt;    also a high entry barrier to export markets for domestic SME food producers.
&gt;
&gt; Now, back to your "specific" case.  The verifier in the importing country
&gt; (who often doest speak english) cannot be expected to know that a
&gt; particular chamber (of hundreds) or authorised officer (of hundreds) is
&gt; accredited or not. very often they are legislatively obliged not to trust
&gt; these random claims. However, under the terms of Free Trade Agreements etc,
&gt; most importing customs authorities will trust the exporting regulator to
&gt; assert the veracity of a digital version.  It's not often actually done
&gt; which is why the majority of these millions of daily certificates are still
&gt; paper and why they are often faked.  Also it's not uncommon when there is
&gt; either some corruption at the border or some greater political tension
&gt; between nations, that an importing authority customs officer will reject a
&gt; valid certificate - to make a point or to get paid some rort. These use
&gt; cases are crying out for a high integrity digital equivalent where fakes
&gt; are hard to make and valid ones cannot be refuted.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So these very specific use case do require a chain of trust between the
&gt; issuer (who is definitely unknown and untrusted by the verifier) and the
&gt; accreditation authority (who is almost always some agency of the exporting
&gt; government and so is known and trusted by the verifier - often legislated
&gt; in the FTA).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Our solution to this problem if digitising certificates has two phases
&gt;
&gt;    1. a single central government site (portal) has the job of
&gt;    registering, identifying, and authorising domestic issuers of certificates
&gt;    (eg chambers and authorised officers). It'll include manual or
&gt;    semi-automated checks against public lists like those PDF docs from the
&gt;    department of agriculture. Idetity would be confirmed via national ID
&gt;    frameworks such as myGovID in Australia.  Then this authorised issuer loads
&gt;    their certificate and the site wraps it in a VC and notarises it to a
&gt;    public ledger - puts a QR code on the cert.  The importing authority
&gt;    customs officer can scan the QR code and will see a ".gov.au" domain as the
&gt;    issuer and so trusts it.  The scan returns also the original ceritificate
&gt;    as issued so it can be compared against the one provided by the importer -
&gt;    thereby preventing just sticking the genuine QR on a fake cert.  This is a
&gt;    "semi distributed, semi digital" model that basically still has the human
&gt;    readable certificates - just that they can be send as a PDF in an email
&gt;    attachment (avoiding the whole original document, wet seal, fedex bag
&gt;    stuff) and also cannot be unreasonably refuted at the border.
&gt;    2. the above scenario still has a lot of centralisation in it and not
&gt;    much machine automation - but still adds a lot of value. The next phase is
&gt;    what has been driving my questions to this WG.  In that phase, the
&gt;    certificate data is JSON and there are two VCs - one issued to the
&gt;    certifier (ie chamber or AAO) by the government - it's a certificate of
&gt;    accreditation.  the other is the actual certificate of origin or
&gt;    phyosanitary certificate issued by the authorised entity.  They will need
&gt;    to be identity linked - possibly via a DID representing the authorised
&gt;    entity.  Both certificates are provided in native digital form, maybe via a
&gt;    G2G channel called a "secure trade lane" or otherwise via any B2B2G
&gt;    channel.  The VCs are verified by the importing regulator system so that
&gt;    the corresponding consignment can be auto-cleared (at least from an
&gt;    origin criteria and food health perspective).
&gt;
&gt; Phase 2 above is what we'd like to do following best practices in the DID
&gt; / VC / DIF world - hence my original question.

&gt;
&gt; Having a verification process that checks the issuer of a VC so the
&gt; verifier can determine if they trust them,
&gt;
&gt; and if they do not then checks the whoever accredits / authorized /
&gt; certified the issuer so the verifier can determine if they trust them
&gt;
&gt;                 and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized /
&gt; certified them, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require
&gt; that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all
&gt; levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this
&gt; point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen
&gt; except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably
&gt; already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to
&gt; go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

&gt;
&gt; Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues
&gt; me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an
&gt; a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I
&gt; think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one
&gt; level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next
&gt; level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with
&gt; it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance
&gt; to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be
&gt; assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be
&gt; heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

&gt;
&gt; Aries RFC 0430 ("Machine Readable Governance Frameworks")
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt;
&gt; contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance
&gt; framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition,
&gt; an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw
&gt; can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID
&gt; X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID
&gt; in the following list." Or lots of other variations.
&gt;
&gt; The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A
&gt; user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how
&gt; universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates
&gt; the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov
&gt; framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the
&gt; rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier,
&gt; and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on
&gt; behalf of the user.

&gt; Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; “ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above

&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real

&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt; having had previous contact, etc.”
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust
&gt; chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg
&gt; Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not
&gt; general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that
&gt; Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans
&gt; wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an
&gt; authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so
&gt; on.  These are our main use cases

&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt; *Subject:* R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally
&gt; binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its
&gt; strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does
&gt; not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in
&gt; EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential,
&gt; he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified
&gt; by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself
&gt; claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for
&gt; that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you
&gt; mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key
&gt; certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role”
&gt; attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such
&gt; certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ),
&gt; which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical
&gt; point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority
&gt; should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This
&gt; process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is
&gt; certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has
&gt; to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are
&gt; oracles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to
&gt; support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on
&gt; linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS
&gt; like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>).
&gt; Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be
&gt; relevant.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested
&gt; in hearing of other views.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best,

&gt;
&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt; digital change.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where
&gt; the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a
&gt; kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; kind regards,
&gt;

&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not
&gt; as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations
&gt; and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing
&gt; chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt;    - Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold
&gt;    them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt;    - Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how
&gt;    they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt;    - Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as
&gt;    oracles.
&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;    license.
&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost
&gt;    be a commodity.
&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;
&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to
&gt; SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient
&gt; and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does
&gt; have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the
&gt; doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost
&gt; anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the
&gt; transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;
&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;
&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;
&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;    impractical.
&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;    proof.
&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;
&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and
&gt; practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!

Subject: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

just to give you a feel for the scale of this "edge case" issue.

 

The world bank together with partner UN agencies maintain statistics on a thing called the "cost of trade"-  its complex stuff but can be simplified to roughly the ratio of price of the thing at the warehouse door of the distributor in an importing nation - over the price of the same thing at factory door of the producer in the exporting nation. So, for example, the cost of trade would be 100% if you can buy a sack of potatoes at the farm gate in USA for $10 but the same sack of potatoes costs $20 from the distributor warehouse in china (for the example of potatoes exported from Us to china).  

 

Globally the average cost of trade between all nations hovers at around 90% for manufactured goods and 150% for agricultural goods.  Obviously it's a super-critical number when reduced to specific bilateral pathways because it has a huge impact on the relative competitiveness of national produce in export markets.  For example is USA-CN cost of trade is 120% but EU-china cost of trade is 80% then EU producers are significantly advangated.  

 

the (very) interesting question is - how does this 100% average cost of trade break down?  where are these costs?  Of course the answer is specific to particular trade lanes but on average it's something like:

*	40% is distributor markup (ie profit int he supply chain)
*	30% is the actual cost of transport 
*	30% is border costs.  

what is even more interesting is that, of that 30% border costs, on average, only around 10% is duty.  So the other 20% are "non-tariff barriers" like the paper certificates I described.  Now when you realise that international trade accounts for around 20% of world GDP then this 20% is a LOT.  world GDP currently stands at $80Tn USD.  So international trade is maybe a bit under $20Tn (including the cost of trade).  So these non-tariff border costs add up to at least $1Trillion.  

 

not an edge case I think....

Hi Steve,

 

"except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not"

 

My main use cases are in international trade and specifically where the issuer is in the exporting country and the verifier is in the importing country.  And pretty much ALL of my use cases are therefore of the "very specific" kind that you indicate may be an unusual edge-case.  My view is that they are certainly not unusual - they are an every day occurrence at volumes that make your eyes water.

 

For example - lets get specific with two very common kinds of certificates.

*	A "preferential certificate or origin" is a document issued by an authorised body in the exporting country (in USA, one of 7000 chambers of commerce) that attests that the goods in a specific shipment (identified with a consignment number and/or invoice number) conform to the terms of free trade agreement.  Crucially, the verifier is  the customs authority in the importing country who will decide whether they believe the (currently mostly paper / wet seal) certificate is valid. If so then the importer is granted preferential duty rates.  Note that a certificate of origin must accompany EVERY shipment.  It's not a multiple use license, it is a single use certificate.  Obviously there are literally millions of them issued every day around the world.  They are a burden (is a non-tariff barrier) on trade.
*	A "phytosanitary certificate" is a document issued by an accredited person (a qualified food health inspector) in the exporting country that attests that the plant material (there are different certificates for animal products) meet the quality criteria of the importing jurisdiction.  There are complex rules maintained by most exporting nations about exactly what kind of phyto certificate is needed by which country for which category of plant based material.  Just search through this for a bit to see what I mean - <a href="https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx">https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx</a>.  that's just for plants - there are five other categories.  The actual certificates are issued by accredited persons - in Australia they are called "Australian Authorised Officers" - to become one, you go through this process <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao</a>.  there are around 700 officers in australia. The department maintains a list of accredited officers at <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register</a> as a set of state level pdf documents.  Like certificates of origin, phytosanitary certificates are single use and so there are also millions issued all the time and they also present a non-tariff barrier to trade and also a high entry barrier to export markets for domestic SME food producers.

Now, back to your "specific" case.  The verifier in the importing country (who often doest speak english) cannot be expected to know that a particular chamber (of hundreds) or authorised officer (of hundreds) is accredited or not. very often they are legislatively obliged not to trust these random claims. However, under the terms of Free Trade Agreements etc, most importing customs authorities will trust the exporting regulator to assert the veracity of a digital version.  It's not often actually done which is why the majority of these millions of daily certificates are still paper and why they are often faked.  Also it's not uncommon when there is either some corruption at the border or some greater political tension between nations, that an importing authority customs officer will reject a valid certificate - to make a point or to get paid some rort. These use cases are crying out for a high integrity digital equivalent where fakes are hard to make and valid ones cannot be refuted.

 

So these very specific use case do require a chain of trust between the issuer (who is definitely unknown and untrusted by the verifier) and the accreditation authority (who is almost always some agency of the exporting government and so is known and trusted by the verifier - often legislated in the FTA).

 

Our solution to this problem if digitising certificates has two phases

1.	a single central government site (portal) has the job of registering, identifying, and authorising domestic issuers of certificates (eg chambers and authorised officers). It'll include manual or semi-automated checks against public lists like those PDF docs from the department of agriculture. Idetity would be confirmed via national ID frameworks such as myGovID in Australia.  Then this authorised issuer loads their certificate and the site wraps it in a VC and notarises it to a public ledger - puts a QR code on the cert.  The importing authority customs officer can scan the QR code and will see a ".gov.au" domain as the issuer and so trusts it.  The scan returns also the original ceritificate as issued so it can be compared against the one provided by the importer - thereby preventing just sticking the genuine QR on a fake cert.  This is a "semi distributed, semi digital" model that basically still has the human readable certificates - just that they can be send as a PDF in an email attachment (avoiding the whole original document, wet seal, fedex bag stuff) and also cannot be unreasonably refuted at the border.
2.	the above scenario still has a lot of centralisation in it and not much machine automation - but still adds a lot of value. The next phase is what has been driving my questions to this WG.  In that phase, the certificate data is JSON and there are two VCs - one issued to the certifier (ie chamber or AAO) by the government - it's a certificate of accreditation.  the other is the actual certificate of origin or phyosanitary certificate issued by the authorised entity.  They will need to be identity linked - possibly via a DID representing the authorised entity.  Both certificates are provided in native digital form, maybe via a G2G channel called a "secure trade lane" or otherwise via any B2B2G channel.  The VCs are verified by the importing regulator system so that the corresponding consignment can be auto-cleared (at least from an origin criteria and food health perspective).

Phase 2 above is what we'd like to do following best practices in the DID / VC / DIF world - hence my original question.

 

kind regards,

steve

Having a verification process that checks the issuer of a VC so the verifier can determine if they trust them, 

and if they do not then checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified the issuer so the verifier can determine if they trust them

                and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified them, etc.

 

Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.

 

Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

Aries RFC 0430 ( &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt; "Machine Readable Governance Frameworks") contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip 

 

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

 

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu &lt;<a href="http://lightest.eu">http://lightest.eu</a>&gt;  or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

For example:

*	Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
*	Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
*	A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
*	DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
*	Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification. 
*	Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
*	Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

*	Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
*	Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
*	And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

*	If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
*	Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
*	Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
*	and so on...

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 

 

Thanks in advance!

         <a>just to give you a feel for the scale of this "edge case" issue.

The world bank together with partner UN agencies maintain statistics on a
thing called the "cost of trade"-  its complex stuff but can be simplified
to roughly the ratio of price of the thing at the warehouse door of the
distributor in an importing nation - over the price of the same thing at
factory door of the producer in the exporting nation. So, for example, the
cost of trade would be 100% if you can buy a sack of potatoes at the farm
gate in USA for $10 but the same sack of potatoes costs $20 from the
distributor warehouse in china (for the example of potatoes exported from
Us to china).

Globally the average cost of trade between all nations hovers at around 90%
for manufactured goods and 150% for agricultural goods.  Obviously it's a
super-critical number when reduced to specific bilateral pathways because
it has a huge impact on the relative competitiveness of national produce in
export markets.  For example is USA-CN cost of trade is 120% but EU-china
cost of trade is 80% then EU producers are significantly advangated.

the (very) interesting question is - how does this 100% average cost of
trade break down?  where are these costs?  Of course the answer is specific
to particular trade lanes but on average it's something like:

   - 40% is distributor markup (ie profit int he supply chain)
   - 30% is the actual cost of transport
   - 30% is border costs.

what is even more interesting is that, of that 30% border costs, on
average, only around 10% is duty.  So the other 20% are "non-tariff
barriers" like the paper certificates I described.  Now when you realise
that international trade accounts for around 20% of world GDP then this 20%
is a LOT.  world GDP currently stands at $80Tn USD.  So international trade
is maybe a bit under $20Tn (including the cost of trade).  So these
non-tariff border costs add up to at least $1Trillion.

not an edge case I think....

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt;
&gt; "except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably
&gt; already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to
&gt; go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not"
&gt;
&gt; My main use cases are in international trade and specifically where the
&gt; issuer is in the exporting country and the verifier is in the importing
&gt; country.  And pretty much ALL of my use cases are therefore of the "very
&gt; specific" kind that you indicate may be an unusual edge-case.  My view is
&gt; that they are certainly not unusual - they are an every day occurrence at
&gt; volumes that make your eyes water.
&gt;
&gt; For example - lets get specific with two very common kinds of certificates.
&gt;
&gt;    - A "preferential certificate or origin" is a document issued by an
&gt;    authorised body in the exporting country (in USA, one of 7000 chambers of
&gt;    commerce) that attests that the goods in a specific shipment (identified
&gt;    with a consignment number and/or invoice number) conform to the terms of
&gt;    free trade agreement.  Crucially, the verifier is  the customs authority in
&gt;    the importing country who will decide whether they believe the (currently
&gt;    mostly paper / wet seal) certificate is valid. If so then the importer is
&gt;    granted preferential duty rates.  Note that a certificate of origin must
&gt;    accompany EVERY shipment.  It's not a multiple use license, it is a single
&gt;    use certificate.  Obviously there are literally millions of them issued
&gt;    every day around the world.  They are a burden (is a non-tariff barrier) on
&gt;    trade.
&gt;    - A "phytosanitary certificate" is a document issued by an accredited
&gt;    person (a qualified food health inspector) in the exporting country that
&gt;    attests that the plant material (there are different certificates for
&gt;    animal products) meet the quality criteria of the importing jurisdiction.
&gt;    There are complex rules maintained by most exporting nations about exactly
&gt;    what kind of phyto certificate is needed by which country for which
&gt;    category of plant based material.  Just search through this for a bit to
&gt;    see what I mean -
&gt;    <a href="https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx">https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx</a>.  that's
&gt;    just for plants - there are five other categories.  The actual certificates
&gt;    are issued by accredited persons - in Australia they are called "Australian
&gt;    Authorised Officers" - to become one, you go through this process
&gt;    <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao</a>.
&gt;    there are around 700 officers in australia. The department maintains a list
&gt;    of accredited officers at
&gt;    <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register</a> as
&gt;    a set of state level pdf documents.  Like certificates of origin,
&gt;    phytosanitary certificates are single use and so there are also millions
&gt;    issued all the time and they also present a non-tariff barrier to trade and
&gt;    also a high entry barrier to export markets for domestic SME food producers.
&gt;
&gt; Now, back to your "specific" case.  The verifier in the importing country
&gt; (who often doest speak english) cannot be expected to know that a
&gt; particular chamber (of hundreds) or authorised officer (of hundreds) is
&gt; accredited or not. very often they are legislatively obliged not to trust
&gt; these random claims. However, under the terms of Free Trade Agreements etc,
&gt; most importing customs authorities will trust the exporting regulator to
&gt; assert the veracity of a digital version.  It's not often actually done
&gt; which is why the majority of these millions of daily certificates are still
&gt; paper and why they are often faked.  Also it's not uncommon when there is
&gt; either some corruption at the border or some greater political tension
&gt; between nations, that an importing authority customs officer will reject a
&gt; valid certificate - to make a point or to get paid some rort. These use
&gt; cases are crying out for a high integrity digital equivalent where fakes
&gt; are hard to make and valid ones cannot be refuted.
&gt;
&gt; So these very specific use case do require a chain of trust between the
&gt; issuer (who is definitely unknown and untrusted by the verifier) and the
&gt; accreditation authority (who is almost always some agency of the exporting
&gt; government and so is known and trusted by the verifier - often legislated
&gt; in the FTA).
&gt;
&gt; Our solution to this problem if digitising certificates has two phases
&gt;
&gt;    1. a single central government site (portal) has the job of
&gt;    registering, identifying, and authorising domestic issuers of certificates
&gt;    (eg chambers and authorised officers). It'll include manual or
&gt;    semi-automated checks against public lists like those PDF docs from the
&gt;    department of agriculture. Idetity would be confirmed via national ID
&gt;    frameworks such as myGovID in Australia.  Then this authorised issuer loads
&gt;    their certificate and the site wraps it in a VC and notarises it to a
&gt;    public ledger - puts a QR code on the cert.  The importing authority
&gt;    customs officer can scan the QR code and will see a ".gov.au" domain as the
&gt;    issuer and so trusts it.  The scan returns also the original ceritificate
&gt;    as issued so it can be compared against the one provided by the importer -
&gt;    thereby preventing just sticking the genuine QR on a fake cert.  This is a
&gt;    "semi distributed, semi digital" model that basically still has the human
&gt;    readable certificates - just that they can be send as a PDF in an email
&gt;    attachment (avoiding the whole original document, wet seal, fedex bag
&gt;    stuff) and also cannot be unreasonably refuted at the border.
&gt;    2. the above scenario still has a lot of centralisation in it and not
&gt;    much machine automation - but still adds a lot of value. The next phase is
&gt;    what has been driving my questions to this WG.  In that phase, the
&gt;    certificate data is JSON and there are two VCs - one issued to the
&gt;    certifier (ie chamber or AAO) by the government - it's a certificate of
&gt;    accreditation.  the other is the actual certificate of origin or
&gt;    phyosanitary certificate issued by the authorised entity.  They will need
&gt;    to be identity linked - possibly via a DID representing the authorised
&gt;    entity.  Both certificates are provided in native digital form, maybe via a
&gt;    G2G channel called a "secure trade lane" or otherwise via any B2B2G
&gt;    channel.  The VCs are verified by the importing regulator system so that
&gt;    the corresponding consignment can be auto-cleared (at least from an
&gt;    origin criteria and food health perspective).
&gt;
&gt; Phase 2 above is what we'd like to do following best practices in the DID
&gt; / VC / DIF world - hence my original question.

&gt;&gt; Having a verification process that checks the issuer of a VC so the
&gt;&gt; verifier can determine if they trust them,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; and if they do not then checks the whoever accredits / authorized /
&gt;&gt; certified the issuer so the verifier can determine if they trust them
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;                 and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized /

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require
&gt;&gt; that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all
&gt;&gt; levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this
&gt;&gt; point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen
&gt;&gt; except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably
&gt;&gt; already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to
&gt;&gt; go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues
&gt;&gt; me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an
&gt;&gt; a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I
&gt;&gt; think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one
&gt;&gt; level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next
&gt;&gt; level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with
&gt;&gt; it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance
&gt;&gt; to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be
&gt;&gt; assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be
&gt;&gt; heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

&gt;&gt; Aries RFC 0430 ("Machine Readable Governance Frameworks")
&gt;&gt; &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt;
&gt;&gt; contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance
&gt;&gt; framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition,
&gt;&gt; an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw
&gt;&gt; can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID
&gt;&gt; X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID
&gt;&gt; in the following list." Or lots of other variations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework.
&gt;&gt; A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how
&gt;&gt; universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates
&gt;&gt; the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov
&gt;&gt; framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the
&gt;&gt; rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier,
&gt;&gt; and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on
&gt;&gt; behalf of the user.

&gt;&gt; “ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust
&gt;&gt; chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg
&gt;&gt; Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not
&gt;&gt; general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that
&gt;&gt; Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans
&gt;&gt; wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an
&gt;&gt; authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so
&gt;&gt; on.  These are our main use cases

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt;&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt;&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt;&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt;&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt;&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt;&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt;&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt;&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt;&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt;&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt;&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt;&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt;&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt;&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt;&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt;&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt;&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt;&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt;&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt;&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt;&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt;&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt;&gt; *Subject:* R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally
&gt;&gt; binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its
&gt;&gt; strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does
&gt;&gt; not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in
&gt;&gt; EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential,
&gt;&gt; he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified
&gt;&gt; by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself
&gt;&gt; claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for
&gt;&gt; that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you
&gt;&gt; mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key
&gt;&gt; certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role”
&gt;&gt; attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such
&gt;&gt; certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ),
&gt;&gt; which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical
&gt;&gt; point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority
&gt;&gt; should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This
&gt;&gt; process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is
&gt;&gt; certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has
&gt;&gt; to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are
&gt;&gt; oracles.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools
&gt;&gt; to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based
&gt;&gt; on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS
&gt;&gt; like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in
&gt;&gt; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>).
&gt;&gt; Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be
&gt;&gt; relevant.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested
&gt;&gt; in hearing of other views.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt;&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt;&gt; digital change.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where
&gt;&gt; the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a
&gt;&gt; kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt;&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt;&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt;&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt;&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; kind regards,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; steve

&gt;&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not
&gt;&gt; as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations
&gt;&gt; and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing
&gt;&gt; chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to
&gt;&gt;    hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt;&gt;    - Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how
&gt;&gt;    they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt;&gt;    - Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as
&gt;&gt;    oracles.
&gt;&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;&gt;    license.
&gt;&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may
&gt;&gt;    almost be a commodity.
&gt;&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to
&gt;&gt; SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt;&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt;&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt;&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt;&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt;&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings
&gt;&gt; patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This
&gt;&gt; convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the
&gt;&gt; patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can
&gt;&gt; be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data
&gt;&gt; related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt;&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt;&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt;&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt;&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt;&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;&gt;    impractical.
&gt;&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;&gt;    proof.
&gt;&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure
&gt;&gt; and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!

I want to point out that your solution for phase 2 is exactly what I was attempting to describe. The verifier in the importing country doesn’t know if the cert they have in their hand comes from a credible issuer (certifier), but by linking that to a source they do recognize as credible (government) in such a way

Two certs, one step of indirection.

 

BTW looking at the links you posted brought back memories of a project I worked on documenting trade tariffs for all things between any two spots on earth. Moving Offal between New Jersey and Singapore by way of Paris? Space shuttle parts from Munich to Amsterdam on Tuesday? There’s a tax for that! 30 printed volumes as I recall.

Subject: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Hi Steve,

 

"except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not"

 

My main use cases are in international trade and specifically where the issuer is in the exporting country and the verifier is in the importing country.  And pretty much ALL of my use cases are therefore of the "very specific" kind that you indicate may be an unusual edge-case.  My view is that they are certainly not unusual - they are an every day occurrence at volumes that make your eyes water.

 

For example - lets get specific with two very common kinds of certificates.

*	A "preferential certificate or origin" is a document issued by an authorised body in the exporting country (in USA, one of 7000 chambers of commerce) that attests that the goods in a specific shipment (identified with a consignment number and/or invoice number) conform to the terms of free trade agreement.  Crucially, the verifier is  the customs authority in the importing country who will decide whether they believe the (currently mostly paper / wet seal) certificate is valid. If so then the importer is granted preferential duty rates.  Note that a certificate of origin must accompany EVERY shipment.  It's not a multiple use license, it is a single use certificate.  Obviously there are literally millions of them issued every day around the world.  They are a burden (is a non-tariff barrier) on trade.
*	A "phytosanitary certificate" is a document issued by an accredited person (a qualified food health inspector) in the exporting country that attests that the plant material (there are different certificates for animal products) meet the quality criteria of the importing jurisdiction.  There are complex rules maintained by most exporting nations about exactly what kind of phyto certificate is needed by which country for which category of plant based material.  Just search through this for a bit to see what I mean - <a href="https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx">https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx</a>.  that's just for plants - there are five other categories.  The actual certificates are issued by accredited persons - in Australia they are called "Australian Authorised Officers" - to become one, you go through this process <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao</a>.  there are around 700 officers in australia. The department maintains a list of accredited officers at <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register</a> as a set of state level pdf documents.  Like certificates of origin, phytosanitary certificates are single use and so there are also millions issued all the time and they also present a non-tariff barrier to trade and also a high entry barrier to export markets for domestic SME food producers.

Now, back to your "specific" case.  The verifier in the importing country (who often doest speak english) cannot be expected to know that a particular chamber (of hundreds) or authorised officer (of hundreds) is accredited or not. very often they are legislatively obliged not to trust these random claims. However, under the terms of Free Trade Agreements etc, most importing customs authorities will trust the exporting regulator to assert the veracity of a digital version.  It's not often actually done which is why the majority of these millions of daily certificates are still paper and why they are often faked.  Also it's not uncommon when there is either some corruption at the border or some greater political tension between nations, that an importing authority customs officer will reject a valid certificate - to make a point or to get paid some rort. These use cases are crying out for a high integrity digital equivalent where fakes are hard to make and valid ones cannot be refuted.

 

So these very specific use case do require a chain of trust between the issuer (who is definitely unknown and untrusted by the verifier) and the accreditation authority (who is almost always some agency of the exporting government and so is known and trusted by the verifier - often legislated in the FTA).

 

Our solution to this problem if digitising certificates has two phases

1.	a single central government site (portal) has the job of registering, identifying, and authorising domestic issuers of certificates (eg chambers and authorised officers). It'll include manual or semi-automated checks against public lists like those PDF docs from the department of agriculture. Idetity would be confirmed via national ID frameworks such as myGovID in Australia.  Then this authorised issuer loads their certificate and the site wraps it in a VC and notarises it to a public ledger - puts a QR code on the cert.  The importing authority customs officer can scan the QR code and will see a ".gov.au" domain as the issuer and so trusts it.  The scan returns also the original ceritificate as issued so it can be compared against the one provided by the importer - thereby preventing just sticking the genuine QR on a fake cert.  This is a "semi distributed, semi digital" model that basically still has the human readable certificates - just that they can be send as a PDF in an email attachment (avoiding the whole original document, wet seal, fedex bag stuff) and also cannot be unreasonably refuted at the border.
2.	the above scenario still has a lot of centralisation in it and not much machine automation - but still adds a lot of value. The next phase is what has been driving my questions to this WG.  In that phase, the certificate data is JSON and there are two VCs - one issued to the certifier (ie chamber or AAO) by the government - it's a certificate of accreditation.  the other is the actual certificate of origin or phyosanitary certificate issued by the authorised entity.  They will need to be identity linked - possibly via a DID representing the authorised entity.  Both certificates are provided in native digital form, maybe via a G2G channel called a "secure trade lane" or otherwise via any B2B2G channel.  The VCs are verified by the importing regulator system so that the corresponding consignment can be auto-cleared (at least from an origin criteria and food health perspective).

Phase 2 above is what we'd like to do following best practices in the DID / VC / DIF world - hence my original question.

                and if not, checks the whoever accredits / authorized / certified them, etc.

 

Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.

 

Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

Aries RFC 0430 ( &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt; "Machine Readable Governance Frameworks") contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip 

 

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

 

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu &lt;<a href="http://lightest.eu">http://lightest.eu</a>&gt;  or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

 

For example:

*	Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
*	Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
*	Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
*	A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
*	DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
*	Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification. 
*	Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
*	Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

*	Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
*	Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
*	And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

*	If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
*	Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
*	Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
*	and so on...

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 

 

Thanks in advance!

against the risks of X.509, certificate authority models, and
browser control of root certificates when I co-authored SSL/TLS, and I
don't want us to make that same mistake again.

* Many of these scenarios do not adequately allow parties at the edges to
choose who they trust. Again, in the DID/VC architecture all parties are
peers and can offer any role. I'm fine someone chooses to only trust
parties trusted by someone else, but again, it should not be mandated. I
worry that some solutions offered will not allow the edges to choose. I
also worry that many of the scenarios shared so far do not adequately
separate identity assurance, claim verification, authorization, etc.

* Be aware that the future will be moving toward multisignature scenarios.
I may use a 3 of 5 collaborative control set under my personal authority to
demonstrate control of my self-sovereign DID, and I may also have a 4 of 9
set of keys give people that are authorized to revoke my control or 5 of 9
that have authority to give it to a new party (ideally me in case of a
catastrophe, buy maybe my heirs.) Many of these scenarios may be better
addressed by multisig threshold scenarios as well. For instance, presenting
an aggregation signature of 3 of 5 verifiable claims from different issuers
could be used to authorize something greater, without having to "phone
home" to the issuers for the greater authority.

         <a>Hi Steve,

"except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably
already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to
go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not"

My main use cases are in international trade and specifically where the
issuer is in the exporting country and the verifier is in the importing
country.  And pretty much ALL of my use cases are therefore of the "very
specific" kind that you indicate may be an unusual edge-case.  My view is
that they are certainly not unusual - they are an every day occurrence at
volumes that make your eyes water.

For example - lets get specific with two very common kinds of certificates.

   - A "preferential certificate or origin" is a document issued by an
   authorised body in the exporting country (in USA, one of 7000 chambers of
   commerce) that attests that the goods in a specific shipment (identified
   with a consignment number and/or invoice number) conform to the terms of
   free trade agreement.  Crucially, the verifier is  the customs authority in
   the importing country who will decide whether they believe the (currently
   mostly paper / wet seal) certificate is valid. If so then the importer is
   granted preferential duty rates.  Note that a certificate of origin must
   accompany EVERY shipment.  It's not a multiple use license, it is a single
   use certificate.  Obviously there are literally millions of them issued
   every day around the world.  They are a burden (is a non-tariff barrier) on
   trade.
   - A "phytosanitary certificate" is a document issued by an accredited
   person (a qualified food health inspector) in the exporting country that
   attests that the plant material (there are different certificates for
   animal products) meet the quality criteria of the importing jurisdiction.
   There are complex rules maintained by most exporting nations about exactly
   what kind of phyto certificate is needed by which country for which
   category of plant based material.  Just search through this for a bit to
   see what I mean -
   </a><a href="https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx">https://micor.agriculture.gov.au/Plants/Pages/default.aspx</a>.  that's just
   for plants - there are five other categories.  The actual certificates are
   issued by accredited persons - in Australia they are called "Australian
   Authorised Officers" - to become one, you go through this process
   <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao</a>.
   there are around 700 officers in australia. The department maintains a list
   of accredited officers at
   <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register">https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/plants-plant-products/ao/register</a>
as
   a set of state level pdf documents.  Like certificates of origin,
   phytosanitary certificates are single use and so there are also millions
   issued all the time and they also present a non-tariff barrier to trade and
   also a high entry barrier to export markets for domestic SME food producers.

Now, back to your "specific" case.  The verifier in the importing country
(who often doest speak english) cannot be expected to know that a
particular chamber (of hundreds) or authorised officer (of hundreds) is
accredited or not. very often they are legislatively obliged not to trust
these random claims. However, under the terms of Free Trade Agreements etc,
most importing customs authorities will trust the exporting regulator to
assert the veracity of a digital version.  It's not often actually done
which is why the majority of these millions of daily certificates are still
paper and why they are often faked.  Also it's not uncommon when there is
either some corruption at the border or some greater political tension
between nations, that an importing authority customs officer will reject a
valid certificate - to make a point or to get paid some rort. These use
cases are crying out for a high integrity digital equivalent where fakes
are hard to make and valid ones cannot be refuted.

So these very specific use case do require a chain of trust between the
issuer (who is definitely unknown and untrusted by the verifier) and the
accreditation authority (who is almost always some agency of the exporting
government and so is known and trusted by the verifier - often legislated
in the FTA).

Our solution to this problem if digitising certificates has two phases

   1. a single central government site (portal) has the job of registering,
   identifying, and authorising domestic issuers of certificates (eg chambers
   and authorised officers). It'll include manual or semi-automated checks
   against public lists like those PDF docs from the department of
   agriculture. Idetity would be confirmed via national ID frameworks such as
   myGovID in Australia.  Then this authorised issuer loads their certificate
   and the site wraps it in a VC and notarises it to a public ledger - puts a
   QR code on the cert.  The importing authority customs officer can scan the
   QR code and will see a ".gov.au" domain as the issuer and so trusts it.
   The scan returns also the original ceritificate as issued so it can be
   compared against the one provided by the importer - thereby preventing just
   sticking the genuine QR on a fake cert.  This is a "semi distributed, semi
   digital" model that basically still has the human readable certificates -
   just that they can be send as a PDF in an email attachment (avoiding the
   whole original document, wet seal, fedex bag stuff) and also cannot be
   unreasonably refuted at the border.
   2. the above scenario still has a lot of centralisation in it and not
   much machine automation - but still adds a lot of value. The next phase is
   what has been driving my questions to this WG.  In that phase, the
   certificate data is JSON and there are two VCs - one issued to the
   certifier (ie chamber or AAO) by the government - it's a certificate of
   accreditation.  the other is the actual certificate of origin or
   phyosanitary certificate issued by the authorised entity.  They will need
   to be identity linked - possibly via a DID representing the authorised
   entity.  Both certificates are provided in native digital form, maybe via a
   G2G channel called a "secure trade lane" or otherwise via any B2B2G
   channel.  The VCs are verified by the importing regulator system so that
   the corresponding consignment can be auto-cleared (at least from an
   origin criteria and food health perspective).

Phase 2 above is what we'd like to do following best practices in the DID /
VC / DIF world - hence my original question.

kind regards,
steve

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues
&gt; me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an
&gt; a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I
&gt; think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one
&gt; level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next
&gt; level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with
&gt; it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance
&gt; to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be
&gt; assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be
&gt; heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

&gt; Aries RFC 0430 ("Machine Readable Governance Frameworks")
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt;
&gt; contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance
&gt; framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition,
&gt; an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw
&gt; can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID
&gt; X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID
&gt; in the following list." Or lots of other variations.
&gt;
&gt; The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A
&gt; user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how
&gt; universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates
&gt; the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov
&gt; framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the
&gt; rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier,
&gt; and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on
&gt; behalf of the user.

&gt; Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip

&gt;
&gt; “ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above

&gt; having had previous contact, etc.”
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust
&gt; chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg
&gt; Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not
&gt; general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that
&gt; Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans
&gt; wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an
&gt; authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so
&gt; on.  These are our main use cases

&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt; *Subject:* R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally
&gt; binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its
&gt; strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does
&gt; not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in
&gt; EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential,
&gt; he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified
&gt; by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself
&gt; claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for
&gt; that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you
&gt; mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key
&gt; certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role”
&gt; attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such
&gt; certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ),
&gt; which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical
&gt; point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority
&gt; should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This
&gt; process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is
&gt; certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has
&gt; to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are
&gt; oracles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to
&gt; support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on
&gt; linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS
&gt; like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>).
&gt; Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be
&gt; relevant.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested
&gt; in hearing of other views.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best,

&gt;
&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt; digital change.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where
&gt; the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a
&gt; kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; kind regards,
&gt;

&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not
&gt; as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations
&gt; and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing
&gt; chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt;    - Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold
&gt;    them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt;    - Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how
&gt;    they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt;    - Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as
&gt;    oracles.
&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;    license.
&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost
&gt;    be a commodity.
&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;
&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to
&gt; SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient
&gt; and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does
&gt; have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the
&gt; doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost
&gt; anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the
&gt; transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?
&gt;

&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;
&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;
&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;    impractical.
&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;    proof.
&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;
&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and
&gt; practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!

Is interesting and has a nice recursive symmetry, but would also require that Accreditation / authorization / certification VC’s be issued at all levels starting at the top and somehow chained down to the issuer. At this point of market maturity that seems like a pretty unlikely think to happen except maybe with very specific use cases, at which point you probably already have sufficient a-priori knowledge that a verifier wouldn’t need to go (much) beyond the issuer to determine if they trust the issuer or not.

 

Would welcome use cases that show I’m thinking about this incorrectly.

Subject: RE: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

Aries RFC 0430 ( &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt; "Machine Readable Governance Frameworks") contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip 

 

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

 

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu &lt;<a href="http://lightest.eu">http://lightest.eu</a>&gt;  or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

 

For example:

*	Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
*	Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
*	Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
*	A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
*	DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
*	Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification. 
*	Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
*	Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

*	Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
*	Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
*	And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

*	If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
*	Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
*	Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
*	and so on...

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 

 

Thanks in advance!

<p>The days when hardware and software were separate entities are long gone. Along with the ongoing worldwide digitization and digitalization, the integration between the virtual and physical worlds is getting stronger – making the Internet of Things (IoT) a real thing. Going further, we can leverage blockchain features like data immutability, distributed character, and exploit the smart contracts it offers to connect it with IoT applications to build a trusted and all-inclusive solution.</p>



<p>Of course, step one is to build out a network to support such solutions. We’ve created a two-part tutorial to showcase how to deploy and connect all the pieces. In part I, we discuss the deployment of a private Hyperledger Besu network on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the minimum configuration of a Raspberry Pi to interact with the deployed network. In part II, we will do a more complex configuration of a Raspberry Pi, making it a physical instance of an externally owned account with an ability to send hardware signed transactions and interact with smart contracts as both signature and measurements provider.</p>



<p>Our goal with part I, <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Deployment+of+Private+Hyperledger+Besu+on+AWS+with+hardware+layer+for+Externally+Owned+Account">Deployment of Private Hyperledger Besu on AWS with Hardware Layer for Externally Owned Account</a>, is to provide an introduction to the topic as well as guidance for getting started.&nbsp; The tutorial details how to connect a hardware node to the network and configure it to interact with the blockchain. In this regard, it can be treated as a blockchain enabler for IoT solutions.</p>



<p>For a quick overview of the setup, see below. The entire methodology and codebase can be found <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Deployment+of+Private+Hyperledger+Besu+on+AWS+with+hardware+layer+for+Externally+Owned+Account">here</a>.</p>



<p>Setting up the blockchain, accounts and hardware node</p>



<p>First of all, a Hyperledger Besu network should be hosted. For our scenario, we show how to provision a network of four Hyperledger Besu nodes, running an IBFT2.0 consensus, and deployed on AWS. If, like us, you’re not a fan of dull and repetitive tasks, you can use terraform to set the scene instead of manually creating all four nodes.</p>



<p>For general-purpose account management, we use MetaMask – a browser extension that helps to create and manage Ethereum blockchain identities. In the tutorial, we present how to connect to our private, test network, and create a new account – used as an identifier and signature of Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>Next, we show how to configure Raspberry Pi to:</p>



  hold its own identity given as a private-public key pair  become a part of our private blockchain network  sign transactions using its own keys and send ether to other nodes  



<p>These steps show how to build a hardware-inclusive blockchain network</p>



<p>Next steps</p>



<p>Getting a handle on the basic ideas and configurations that have to be done in order to have a private Hyperledger Besu blockchain with a hardware node attached is only the beginning. In Part II of our tutorial, we will go beyond merely sending some virtual (and, in fact, worthless) tokens between virtual accounts. We’ll take advantage of the functionalities offered by smart contracts and dive into a business case where the hardware node serves as a trusted source of measurements used to invalidate or finalize a contract. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>While she’s not necessarily my favorite performing artist, Taylor Swift’s dominance of the music industry over the past decade is indisputable.

<p>As consumer attention spans decrease amid a sea of devices, websites, and streaming platforms vying for eyeballs, viral marketing has become a critical tool for reaching mass audiences.

Monetizing this traffic can be accomplished in several ways. First, indirectly, unscrupulous website owners spin up bot networks to generate false traffic across their websites and create profitable false impressions paid for by advertisers. Another is by vendors who directly operate bot networks and sell the false impressions themselves. One such vendor, Devumi, is alleged to have had over 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors, and models, paying for faked social media impressions and “likes.”</p>



<p>To combat increasingly sophisticated vendor solutions dedicated to identifying and neutralizing false advertising and impressions, fraudsters’ methods for creating and utilizing fraudulent accounts continue to evolve. Unfortunately, these methods are also an ideal conduit for perpetuating a full gamut of digital identity fraud from the creation of synthetic identities to money laundering and account takeover.</p>



<p>Today there is no “silver bullet” to defend against the threats mentioned above. But making any progress towards the adoption of digital identity standards will help destroy the economic model that underpins the fraud ecosystem. For too long, the dominant thinking across industry verticals has remained that user friction and high levels of identity assurance must remain mutually exclusive. For social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, the insertion of steps within the account creation process to ensure that a valid physical person is involved will lead to higher user drop-off rates and, therefore, slower platform growth. This no longer has to be the case.</p>



<p>In the near-term, mobile telecommunications data, user-entity and behavioral analytics, and networked fraud detection platforms offer product managers the tools to pick up on risk signals. This can ultimately identify fraudulent user accounts and provides a high degree of accuracy and no added user friction. While no solution can, or should, claim to be 100% accurate, these technologies continue to increase the time, cost, and effort associated with fraudulent accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This escalation of the cost of creating fraudulent accounts is critical. This is because shifting the fraud equation is the fundamental equation to keep in mind. Eliminating all fraudulent accounts is an admirable goal, but perhaps unattainable. Making it more expensive to create a fraudulent account than the profit generated by a fraudulent account is both achievable. It will go the farthest towards meeting the goals of trust and growth teams alike.</p>



<p>This equation holds across the broader digital identity landscape and remains applicable across payments, cybersecurity, and marketing. Fraudsters have budgets and investors the same as legitimate enterprises. Working to make the cost of successfully perpetuating fraud high enough to make large-scale operations, unsustainable offers the best chance of mitigating risks. The challenge is now, how can businesses do that without fundamentally compromising the experience of your authentic users and compromising growth?</p>

<p>This Tuesday, MasterCard and Microsoft announced a partnership to develop a decentralized digital identity solution. As noted last week, the financial services industry is intrinsically reliant on digital identity – thus, it’s a natural progression for major financial services providers to expand their scope into identity management.</p>
<p>Our highlighted deals also reflect this trend: Prove (previously Payfone) acquired Early Warning Services’ mobile authentication technology (and, with it, 500 financial institutions as clients). Meanwhile, ComplyAdvantage, a company specifically targeting financial risk and crime analysis, raised $50 million to continue the development of its solution. Finally, Equifax acquired Ansonia Credit Data, integrating information from the trucking and transportation industry into its PayNet product.</p>

         <a>Agree, but I think Steve C. presents an interesting nuance that intrigues me. Defining acceptable authority or creating white lists implies an a-priori perspective of what a verifier would consider acceptable. Here, I think, the situation is that even if an assurance is unacceptable at one level, if the chain of assurance can be followed to the entity at the next level up … and that entity is acceptable then the verifier could be OK with it. Of course a verifier could always set the minimal level of acceptance to be the top most level (e.g. government or other well know body) and be assured that they wouldn’t reject anything unnecessarily, but that would be heavy handed. Maybe there can be a dynamic nature to setting the threshold.

Subject: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Aries RFC 0430 ( &lt;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md</a>&gt; "Machine Readable Governance Frameworks") contemplates this question and answers it by saying that any governance framework can answer the question by a DIF-style presentation definition, an Indy proof request, or some other demand for proof. That is, the gov fw can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier, and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on behalf of the user.

Actually, these are exactly the type of use cases I think are important to get on the radar of the WG to challenge our thinking. In your Sarah Doe example, as I understand it the department of public health in Australia accredits inspectors directly, so the chain is pretty short: the validator is either comfortable with the assurance of the government or is not. In other scenarios a verifier might have to continue farther up the chain to reach an institution they know or are comfortable with.

Subject: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip 

 

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

 

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu &lt;<a href="http://lightest.eu">http://lightest.eu</a>&gt;  or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

 

For example:

*	Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
*	Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
*	Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
*	A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
*	DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
*	Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification. 
*	Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
*	Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

*	Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
*	Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
*	And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

*	If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
*	Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
*	Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
*	and so on...

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 

 

Thanks in advance!

can say, "Trust any university that can present a credential issued by DID
X, showing that they're accredited." Or the gov fw can say, "Trust any DID
in the following list." Or lots of other variations.

The thinking is that software "installs" or "activates" a gov framework. A
user might get prompted: "Do you want to use trust rules about how
universities are accredited, as codified by Org X?" Saying yes activates
the gov framework for all proving contexts that identify that gov
framework, going forward. Once the user says yes, the software reads the
rules that tell how an org becomes trusted to be an issuer or a verifier,
and automatically challenges other parties to prove their bona fides on
behalf of the user.

&gt; Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; “ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real

&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt; having had previous contact, etc.”
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust
&gt; chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg
&gt; Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not
&gt; general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that
&gt; Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans
&gt; wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an
&gt; authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so
&gt; on.  These are our main use cases

&gt;
&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt; *Subject:* R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally
&gt; binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its
&gt; strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does
&gt; not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in
&gt; EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential,
&gt; he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified
&gt; by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself
&gt; claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for
&gt; that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you
&gt; mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key
&gt; certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role”
&gt; attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such
&gt; certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ),
&gt; which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical
&gt; point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority
&gt; should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This
&gt; process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is
&gt; certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has
&gt; to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are
&gt; oracles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to
&gt; support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on
&gt; linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS
&gt; like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>).
&gt; Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be
&gt; relevant.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested
&gt; in hearing of other views.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best,

&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt; digital change.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where
&gt; the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a
&gt; kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; kind regards,
&gt;

&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not
&gt; as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations
&gt; and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing
&gt; chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt;    - Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold
&gt;    them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt;    - Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how
&gt;    they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt;    - Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as
&gt;    oracles.
&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;    license.
&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost
&gt;    be a commodity.
&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;
&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to
&gt; SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient
&gt; and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does
&gt; have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the
&gt; doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost
&gt; anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the
&gt; transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?
&gt;

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;
&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;
&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;
&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;    impractical.
&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;    proof.
&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;
&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and
&gt; practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;

Thanks steve, I will have a look at toip 

 

“ The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc.”

 

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

*	Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
*	Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
*	And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

*	If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
*	Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.

It’s certainly true that, as a verifier, I really don’t need the trust chain to price accreditation if the issuer itself is already well known (eg Oxford / Harvard).  But most o our use cases are not like that.  It’s not general public knowledge (although often publically accessible ) that Australian business 78 145 321 320 is the trademark owner of lindemans wine.  Or that John Smith is an accredited vet.  Or that Sarah doe is an authorised officer that is accredited for food safety inspections - and so on.  These are our main use cases

&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.
&gt;  
&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;  
&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt; Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;  
&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;  
&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;  
&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;  
&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

&gt;    a patient with a doctor, or a citizen with one of the government agency for

&gt; I'm happy to respond to your questions with my thoughts:
&gt;
&gt;    - Do DIDs even have to consider VC at all?
&gt;    - No.  VCs are made much easier (viable?) with DIDs to bind the claims
&gt;       to the issuer, but not the reverse (DIDs relying on VCs). For VCs with no
&gt;       "call home" component, I think DIDs are extremely useful, bordering on
&gt;       necessary.
&gt;    - Isn't everything about a DID and DID document entirely public?
&gt;    - A public DID is -- e.g. on one a public ledger. However, a peer DID
&gt;       shared only amongst communicating entities is not. And such a peer DID is
&gt;       not useful for VCs -- the are just to enable a secure communication channel.
&gt;    - Do DIDs natively have anything to do with holders, claims, ZKP's?
&gt;    - DIDs have something to do with claims -- they are used to determine
&gt;       who issued the claims. As well, in BBS+, the signatures on the claims are
&gt;       derived from the public key in the DIDDoc of the issuer to enable
&gt;       tamper-evidence.
&gt;    - Can't a DID-capable wallet be useful and interoperable if it enables
&gt;    non-repudiable digital signatures, authentication and authorization without
&gt;    any notion of VCs, credentials and claims?
&gt;       - I don't think they are useful -- at least I've not seen good
&gt;       examples. I think DIDs are necessary foundational elements, but I see far
&gt;       more value in VC wallets as the "useful and interoperable" layer. The
&gt;       biggest issue for me is correlatability - a DID being "the identifier" for
&gt;       a person.
&gt;    - Do DID methods have anything much to do with VCs?
&gt;       - They do insofar as DIDs bind the VC with the issuer and so to
&gt;       resolve the issuer, you need to be able to use it's DID method.  By
&gt;       extension, issuer DIDs enable tamper-evidence and support for revocation
&gt;       (proof that the issuer revoked an issued credential).
&gt;       - In some VC models, DIDs also bind the holder to the credential
&gt;       during presentation of a proof.

&gt;&gt; There were already too many moving parts for me to follow and the

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; W3C were wise to limit dependency between DID and VCs:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - Do DIDs even have to consider VC at all?
&gt;&gt;    - Isn't everything about a DID and DID document entirely public?

&gt;&gt;    - Do DID methods have anything much to do with VCs?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now, I do understand the value of claims related to DIDs, the promise of
&gt;&gt; SIOP, the benefits of ZKP and the link between wallets and agents when it
&gt;&gt; comes to authorizations for Bob (as opposed to authorizations for Alice or
&gt;&gt; other DID controllers). But I sense a lot of complication, in terms of
&gt;&gt; standards, interop, and adoption, arising from an unnecessary blending of
&gt;&gt; VC and DID.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example, it's obvious that trust and governance are going to be
&gt;&gt; essential to both DID methods and VCs but wouldn't it help to try and
&gt;&gt; partition the conversations as much as possible?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt;&gt;&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt;&gt;&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt;&gt;&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt;&gt;&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt;&gt;&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt;&gt;&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt;&gt;&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt;&gt;&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt;&gt;&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt;&gt;&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt;&gt;&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt;&gt;&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt;&gt;&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt;&gt;&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt;&gt;&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt;&gt;&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt;&gt;&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt;&gt;&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Subject:* R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally
&gt;&gt;&gt; binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its
&gt;&gt;&gt; strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does
&gt;&gt;&gt; not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials”
&gt;&gt;&gt; in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a
&gt;&gt;&gt; credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is
&gt;&gt;&gt; certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith
&gt;&gt;&gt; is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal
&gt;&gt;&gt; responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you
&gt;&gt;&gt; mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key
&gt;&gt;&gt; certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role”
&gt;&gt;&gt; attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such
&gt;&gt;&gt; certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ),
&gt;&gt;&gt; which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical
&gt;&gt;&gt; point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority
&gt;&gt;&gt; should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This
&gt;&gt;&gt; process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is
&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are
&gt;&gt;&gt; oracles.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools
&gt;&gt;&gt; to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based
&gt;&gt;&gt; on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS
&gt;&gt;&gt; like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; relevant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested
&gt;&gt;&gt; in hearing of other views.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt;&gt;&gt; digital change.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases
&gt;&gt;&gt; where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders"
&gt;&gt;&gt; - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt;&gt;&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt;&gt;&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations
&gt;&gt;&gt; and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing
&gt;&gt;&gt; chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; For example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to
&gt;&gt;&gt;    hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how
&gt;&gt;&gt;    they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as
&gt;&gt;&gt;    oracles.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;&gt;&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;&gt;&gt;    license.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;&gt;&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;&gt;&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may
&gt;&gt;&gt;    almost be a commodity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;&gt;&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;&gt;&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related
&gt;&gt;&gt; to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt;&gt;&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt;&gt;&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt;&gt;&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt;&gt;&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings
&gt;&gt;&gt; patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This
&gt;&gt;&gt; convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can
&gt;&gt;&gt; be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data
&gt;&gt;&gt; related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt;&gt;&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt;&gt;&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt;&gt;&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;&gt;&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;&gt;&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;&gt;&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;&gt;&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;&gt;&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;&gt;&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;&gt;&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;&gt;&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;&gt;&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;&gt;&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a
&gt;&gt;&gt;    service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health
&gt;&gt;&gt;    cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets
&gt;&gt;&gt;    it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;&gt;&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;&gt;&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;&gt;&gt;    impractical.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public
&gt;&gt;&gt;    lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers
&gt;&gt;&gt;    can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;&gt;&gt;    proof.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure
&gt;&gt;&gt; and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!

My comments: Peer DID together with VCs can be useful for pairwise business relationships, such as an individual with his current employer, or a patient with a doctor, or a citizen with one of the government agency for business purposes. In addition to secure communication channel, the Peer DID can leverage VCs for on-going trusted pairwise relationship.

I'm happy to respond to your questions with my thoughts:

Do DIDs even have to consider VC at all?

No.  VCs are made much easier (viable?) with DIDs to bind the claims to the issuer, but not the reverse (DIDs relying on VCs). For VCs with no "call home" component, I think DIDs are extremely useful, bordering on necessary.

A public DID is -- e.g. on one a public ledger. However, a peer DID shared only amongst communicating entities is not. And such a peer DID is not useful for VCs -- the are just to enable a secure communication channel.
Do DIDs natively have anything to do with holders, claims, ZKP's?

DIDs have something to do with claims -- they are used to determine who issued the claims. As well, in BBS+, the signatures on the claims are derived from the public key in the DIDDoc of the issuer to enable tamper-evidence.
Can't a DID-capable wallet be useful and interoperable if it enables non-repudiable digital signatures, authentication and authorization without any notion of VCs, credentials and claims?
I don't think they are useful -- at least I've not seen good examples. I think DIDs are necessary foundational elements, but I see far more value in VC wallets as the "useful and interoperable" layer. The biggest issue for me is correlatability - a DID being "the identifier" for a person. 
Do DID methods have anything much to do with VCs?
They do insofar as DIDs bind the VC with the issuer and so to resolve the issuer, you need to be able to use it's DID method.  By extension, issuer DIDs enable tamper-evidence and support for revocation (proof that the issuer revoked an issued credential).
In some VC models, DIDs also bind the holder to the credential during presentation of a proof.

W3C were wise to limit dependency between DID and VCs:

Isn't everything about a DID and DID document entirely public?

Do DIDs natively have anything to do with holders, claims, ZKP's?
Can't a DID-capable wallet be useful and interoperable if it enables non-repudiable digital signatures, authentication and authorization without any notion of VCs, credentials and claims?

Now, I do understand the value of claims related to DIDs, the promise of SIOP, the benefits of ZKP and the link between wallets and agents when it comes to authorizations for Bob (as opposed to authorizations for Alice or other DID controllers). But I sense a lot of complication, in terms of standards, interop, and adoption, arising from an unnecessary blending of VC and DID.


For example, it's obvious that trust and governance are going to be essential to both DID methods and VCs but wouldn't it help to try and partition the conversations as much as possible?

I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

 

For example:

Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

 

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.
And there are hundreds of others....

Some initial thinking

If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit impractical.
Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list. Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge proof. 
and so on...

Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers. 

 

Thanks in advance!

   - Isn't everything about a DID and DID document entirely public?
   - A public DID is -- e.g. on one a public ledger. However, a peer DID
      shared only amongst communicating entities is not. And such a peer DID is
      not useful for VCs -- the are just to enable a secure
communication channel.
   - Do DIDs natively have anything to do with holders, claims, ZKP's?
   - DIDs have something to do with claims -- they are used to determine
      who issued the claims. As well, in BBS+, the signatures on the claims are
      derived from the public key in the DIDDoc of the issuer to enable
      tamper-evidence.
   - Can't a DID-capable wallet be useful and interoperable if it enables
   non-repudiable digital signatures, authentication and authorization without
   any notion of VCs, credentials and claims?
      - I don't think they are useful -- at least I've not seen good
      examples. I think DIDs are necessary foundational elements, but I see far
      more value in VC wallets as the "useful and interoperable" layer. The
      biggest issue for me is correlatability - a DID being "the
identifier" for
      a person.
   - Do DID methods have anything much to do with VCs?
      - They do insofar as DIDs bind the VC with the issuer and so to
      resolve the issuer, you need to be able to use it's DID method.  By
      extension, issuer DIDs enable tamper-evidence and support for revocation
      (proof that the issuer revoked an issued credential).
      - In some VC models, DIDs also bind the holder to the credential
      during presentation of a proof.

&gt;&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt;&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt;&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt;&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt;&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt;&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt;&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt;&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt;&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt;&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt;&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt;&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt;&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt;&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt;&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt;&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt;&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt;&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt;&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt;&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt;&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt;&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt;&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt;&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt;&gt; digital change.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where
&gt;&gt; the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a
&gt;&gt; kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt;&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt;&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt;&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt;&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

&gt;&gt; At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not
&gt;&gt; as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations
&gt;&gt; and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing
&gt;&gt; chains of trust with excess digital innovation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to
&gt;&gt;    hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
&gt;&gt;    - Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how
&gt;&gt;    they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
&gt;&gt;    - Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as
&gt;&gt;    oracles.
&gt;&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;&gt;    license.
&gt;&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may
&gt;&gt;    almost be a commodity.
&gt;&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to
&gt;&gt; SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt;&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt;&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt;&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt;&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt;&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings
&gt;&gt; patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This
&gt;&gt; convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the
&gt;&gt; patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can
&gt;&gt; be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data
&gt;&gt; related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt;&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt;&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt;&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt;&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt;&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;&gt;    impractical.
&gt;&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;&gt;    proof.
&gt;&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure
&gt;&gt; and practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!

Now, I do understand the value of claims related to DIDs, the promise of
SIOP, the benefits of ZKP and the link between wallets and agents when it
comes to authorizations for Bob (as opposed to authorizations for Alice or
other DID controllers). But I sense a lot of complication, in terms of
standards, interop, and adoption, arising from an unnecessary blending of
VC and DID.

For example, it's obvious that trust and governance are going to be
essential to both DID methods and VCs but wouldn't it help to try and
partition the conversations as much as possible?

&gt; I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack
&gt; WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just
&gt; such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded
&gt; in real use cases.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of
&gt; ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or
&gt; attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least
&gt; partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants
&gt; can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to
&gt; issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to
&gt; the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who
&gt; in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US),
&gt; who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future
&gt; there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain
&gt; just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma
&gt; credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above
&gt; example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it
&gt; that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real
&gt; world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants,
&gt; or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead,
&gt; having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the
&gt; entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek
&gt; trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed
&gt; risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

&gt; *Subject:* R: A question on best practices for dependent claims
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear Steve, all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally
&gt; binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its
&gt; strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does
&gt; not have a satisfying solution yet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in
&gt; EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential,
&gt; he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified
&gt; by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself
&gt; claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for
&gt; that (identification is essential to enforce liability).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you
&gt; mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key
&gt; certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role”
&gt; attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such
&gt; certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ),
&gt; which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical
&gt; point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority
&gt; should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This
&gt; process is CA-centric and inefficient.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is
&gt; certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has
&gt; to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are
&gt; oracles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to
&gt; support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on
&gt; linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS
&gt; like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>).
&gt; Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be
&gt; relevant.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested
&gt; in hearing of other views.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best,

&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you
&gt; are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much
&gt; digital change.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where
&gt; the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a
&gt; kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of
&gt; facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is
&gt; just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation
&gt; authority and API access is authenticated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any
&gt; ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

&gt;    - A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID
&gt;    can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's
&gt;    license.
&gt;    - DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at
&gt;    least as good as the ink on paper ones.
&gt;    - Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based
&gt;    on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
&gt;    - Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost
&gt;    be a commodity.
&gt;    - Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records
&gt;    retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the
&gt;    loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
&gt;
&gt; In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to
&gt; SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she
&gt; has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through
&gt; the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the
&gt; physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in
&gt; terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with
&gt; an administrative identity.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient
&gt; and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does
&gt; have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the
&gt; doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost
&gt; anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the
&gt; transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;
&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;
&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;
&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;    impractical.
&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;    proof.
&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;
&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and
&gt; practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;

         <a>I would highly recommend looking into the Trust over IP Governance Stack WG (disclosure I am vice-chair for the group). We are dealing with just such questions and welcome a variety of perspectives, especially grounded in real use cases.

 

Currently some of the thinking is focused on the notion of ‘self-certification’ and ‘self-attestation’ vs. certification or attestation from a ‘known and trusted’ source whose trust is at least partially anchored by operating within a trust framework (that participants can trust). For example a university may self-certify their ability to issue a diploma VC. The perceived value of that VC though is connected to the university being accredited by an educational accreditation body, who in turn is certified by CHEA or the US department of education (in the US), who at the top of the authority chain is self-certified. In the future there may even be a separate accreditation body, independent of the chain just described that is solely focused on the issuance of diploma credentials from accredited and non-accredited universities.

 

The main question is what does a verifier need to trust. In the above example, is the question simply do I have the right university, or is it that the university accredited, by a certified accreditor, etc. In the real world, much of this is known to and trusted a-priori by the participants, or at least is assumed based on seeing a familiar name, a letterhead, having had previous contact, etc. so a verifier probably doesn’t need the entire chain of authority to properly evaluate a VC. When participants seek trust assurance because they don’t already have it or there is presumed risk of fraudulent activity is where the problem comes in.

Subject: R: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Dear Steve, all,

 

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

 

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

 

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

 

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

 

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

 

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

 

Best,

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

 

Hi Adrian,

 

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.  

 

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

 

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

 

kind regards,

steve

At least for medical, and maybe veterinary, practice the solution is not as complicated as it would seem if we make best use of existing regulations and practices. The problem arises when we try to overwhelm the existing chains of trust with excess digital innovation.

 

For example:

*	Licensed physicians have public credentials that can be used to hold them accountable if their actions are logged in non-repudiable way.
*	Because these credentials are public, it makes no difference how they are held or even if they are published by an oracle like a state board.
*	Many state and federal boards already offer APIs that can serve as oracles.
*	A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
*	DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
*	Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification. 
*	Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
*	Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.

In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

 

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

 

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

 

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?

The possible way it could be implemented with DIDs is:

#1 John Smith obtains a veterinarian license (credential) from government
1.1 John Smith with the help of a (wallet-like) app creates his own DID
did:example:johnid
 1.1.1 John Smith creates a key pair and places public key data in the
verificationMethods and assertionMethod section of his DID document.
He will use private key to issue(assert) health credentials which
verifiers will check with corresponding public key
1.2 He provides a proof of control to the government
1.3 Government agency issues a credential:
```json
{
  issuer: {
     id: "healthcare.gov.au",
     signingKey: "890ABC"
  },
  credentialSubject: {
    id: "did:example:johnid",
    accreditedAs: "Veterinarian"
  }
  expirationDate: "2025.01.01",
  proof: {
    signatureValue: "123"
  }
}
```
The signing key which is used by the government must be well-known and
trusted by the verifier. Government agency can use centralized trust
chain that is common today (https certs, dns, on-prems federated
infrastructure), or use DIDs, zCaps, but these will probably link to
the root of trust as well.
1.4 John stores the credential in his trusted storage. In the simple
case - local device. Another storage option may be secure data store:
<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a> - one may
be hosted with the government help, but John can pick any other which
he trusts.

#2 Pet owner obtains a passport and ID for Snoopy the dog from the
government or authorized party. Passport has a photo (maybe also
biometrics?) and says
id: "Snoopy-passport-112"
Passport may be physical or digital or even Snoopy could have his own
DID, but it is not important for the current scenario. Only having a
verifiable ID for Snoopy is needed.

#3 Pet owner obtains health credential from John Smith
3.1 John smith issues a credential:
```json
{
  issuer: "did:example:johnid#key1",
  credentialSubject: {
    id: "Snoopy-passport-112",
    vaccinatedDate: "2020.07.30",
    bloodTest: "healthy",
  },
  expirationDate: "2022.01.01",
  proof: {
    signatureValue: "456"
  }
}
```
He uses a private key generated at step 1.1.1 to obtain a
signatureValue, and places the public key id into the issuer field:
"did:example:johnid#key1" - that is DID url pointing into DID
document.
3.2 John sends this health credential *and* his vet license credential
to the pet owner
3.3 Pet owner stores both health credential and John's vet license
credential in a trusted storage.

#4 Border officer verifies pet health credential
4.1 Pet owner presents Snoopy, his passport and sends both health
credential with a John's vet license credential to the Border officer.
4.2 Border officer checks photo in the passport is really Snoopy
(maybe also checks biometrics)
4.3 He checks that Veterinarian license is really signed by a trusted

4.4 He checks that accredited DID from the license has the same value
as the DID of the health credential issuer. "did:example:johnid" ==
urlparse("did:example:johnid#key1").netloc
4.5 He resolves the DID did:example:johnid to obtain DID Document
4.6 He searches id: #key1 in the DID Document list under "verificationMethod"
4.7 He checks that "#key1" is also linked in the "assertionMethod" in
the DID Document
4.8 He uses the value in the "publicKeyHex" of the verificationMethod
with id "key1" to verify signature on the pet health credential.
4.9 He checks that credentialSubject id == "Snoopy-passport-112"

         Dear Steve, all,

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

         <a>Dear Steve, all,

this is a familiar issue in EU, due to the large diffusion on legally binding digital signature (eIDAS regulation), and especially of its strongest form which is the “qualified” digital signature. IMHO, it does not have a satisfying solution yet.

The most common way of dealing with the “right of issuing credentials” in EU is simply through “liability”: when vet John Smith issues a credential, he is in fact signign a document with a key whose public key is certified by a CA who identified him. In signing the document, John Smith is himself claiming to be an authorized vet, and he takes legal responsibility for that (identification is essential to enforce liability).

This is however not satisfying in many situations, like those you mention.  A different approach involves  “role certificates”,  public key certificates issued by the CA which additionally contains a specific “role” attribute (e.g., “accredited vet”). The process for issuing/revoking such certificates involves the authority (e.g.  </a><a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> ), which must interact with the CA.  The interaction with the CA is a critical point, especially when the vet loses his qualification: the authority should inform the CA, and the CA should revoke the certificate. This process is CA-centric and inefficient.

The use of external existing oracles, as recommended by Adrian, is certainly a valid option. The issue here is obviously that the verifyer has to be oracle-aware, and implement as many oracle integrations as  there are oracles.

There is now a lot of interest on “trust frameworks”, as a set of tools to support the verifier. I’ve seen different approaches, from those based on linked credentials to those based on external infrastructures (e.g., DNS like in lightest.eu or centrally managed like in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks</a>). Applicability to IOT (where automatizaion is paramount) appears to be relevant.

I believe this will be a field of growing interest. I am very interested in hearing of other views.

Best,

Oggetto: Re: A question on best practices for dependent claims

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for that - a lot of common sense in there.  And, yes, I think you are right about not overwhelming existing trust chains with too much digital change.

I think it'll work fine for most use cases.  We do have a few cases where the register is not public (for example "Australian Trusted Traders" - a kind of international supply chain accreditation granted after audit of facilities and processes).  But perhaps the simple solution for that is just that the "convener" needs also to be trusted by the accreditation authority and API access is authenticated.

I really appreciate this response Adrian.  And if anyone else has any ideas to contribute, we are listening attentively and gratefully ;)

kind regards,
steve

  *   A simple DID credential that links an official oracle with the DID can be self-signed or co-signed by a notary who also reviews a driver's license.
  *   DID wallets can also support a non-repudiable digital signature at least as good as the ink on paper ones.
  *   Paper signatures in medicine are often accepted by verifiers based on "Trust On First Use" with out-of-band verification.
  *   Timestamping signatures on public blockchains is easy and may almost be a commodity.
  *   Licensed physicians and verifiers are typically subject to records retention regulations that combine with digital timestamps to close the loop on non-repudiation and enforcement.
In this example and many like it, the technology and standards related to SSI are almost entirely in the control of the physician herself. Yes she has to install a relatively simple DID wallet. Yes, she has to go through the one-time credential issuance process. The economic benefit to the physician of a self-sovereign professional identity pays off handsomely in terms of not sharing power or revenue with hospitals that provide them with an administrative identity.

The oracles already exist and don't need to know about SSI or VCs.

The last thing left is hosting the digital transaction that brings patient and doctor together and gets the document timestamped. This convener does have to be SSI-aware and trusted as an intermediary by the patient, the doctor, and the verifier. Nice thing is, these conveners can be almost anywhere and don't themselves need to keep any patient data related to the transaction, limiting both security and privacy risks.

Wouldn't this be the fastest way to gain mass adoption of SSI?

Hi all,

I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples

  *   Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
  *   Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary surgeon, the certificate is useless.

Some initial thinking

  *   If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?

&gt; I'm hoping some of you will have some sage advice for me on how best to
&gt; handle a common pattern that we need to solve here in Australia.  The
&gt; generalised case is that a certificate (ie credential) issued by X has
&gt; little value to verifier Y unless backed up by an accreditation (ie
&gt; credential) issued by recognised authority Z that says X is authorised to
&gt; issue this type of claim.  Some real world examples
&gt;
&gt;    - Business identity ABN123 issues a claim that a consignment of wine
&gt;    is genuine penfolds.  But without another claim from IP Australia that
&gt;    ABN123 is the holder of trademark "Penfolds" then it's of little value.
&gt;    - Veterinary surgeon John Smith issues an animal health certificate
&gt;    about snoopy the dog.  But without a supporting claim from
&gt;    <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> that john smith is an accredited vetinary
&gt;    surgeon, the certificate is useless.
&gt;    - And there are hundreds of others....
&gt;
&gt; Some initial thinking
&gt;
&gt;    - If these are totally separate credentials then there is a problem
&gt;    with identity linking.  The subject of one claim (john smith is a vet) must
&gt;    be identical to the issuer of the other claim (snoopy is healthy).  even if
&gt;    the identifiers are the same, there are lots of john smiths in the world so
&gt;    how to be sure that the one issuing the cert about snoopy is the one that
&gt;    was accredited?  Does John smith first create a self-sovereign identity and
&gt;    get <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> to issue the claim to that identity?
&gt;    - Another approach is that the accreditation authority runs a service
&gt;    that counter-signs each certificate.  so john issues the health cert and
&gt;    then authenticates to <a href="https://www.anzcvs.org.au/">https://www.anzcvs.org.au/</a> and gets it
&gt;    counter-signed.  the verifier can trace the authority through a single
&gt;    health certifiate.  This implies some real-time infrastructure capability
&gt;    on the part of all accreditation authorities that might be a bit
&gt;    impractical.
&gt;    - Another is that the accreditation authorities maintain public lists
&gt;    of accredited identities via some public ledger protocol. verifiers can
&gt;    check the issuer id in the health claim and then check the public list.
&gt;    Maybe the lists need to be anonymised via some kind of zero knowledge
&gt;    proof.
&gt;    - and so on...
&gt;
&gt; Looking for best practice advice that is both cryptographically secure and
&gt; practical to implement for large number of accreditors and certifiers.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!

<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) and Financial Data Exchange hosted a joint workshop on July 21, 2020 to share information on their respective standards and certification programs.</p>
<p>OIDF Chairman, Nat Sakimura provided a global view of the state of financial APIs followed by FDX Managing Director, Don Cardinal, who described FDX’s focus as the financial services industry’s standards development and certification center of excellence in the US. Torsten Lodderstedt, CTO at yes.com and a OIDF contributor overviewed the roadmap of the Foundation’s Financial-grade API (FAPI). FDX Director Product, Dinesh Katyal, shared a high level look at the FDX API plans. All this led to the key part of the conversation: how the two organizations may best to continue to collaborate. The workshop concluded with a demonstration of the OIDF certification suite including FAPI certification by Joseph Heenan, Fintech Labs CTO and lead developer of the OIDF Certification Program.</p>

 and how today’s most powerful authentication mechanisms can be decentralized <p>It is a mouthful of an acronym: it stands for OpenID Connect — Self-Issued Identity Provider. Unless you are familiar with the terminology of the OpenID community, knowing what the acronym stands for doesn’t illuminate much, but rest assured, this is one of the most exciting developments to support the widespread adoption of Verifiable Credentials across the&nbsp;web.</p><p>This post will explain how it’s exciting and what kinds of adoption it could galvanize. First, we will cover OpenID &amp; OpenID Connect, then touch on how decentralized identity (or “self-sovereign identity”) relates to “authentication” and “user accounts,” and finally how they can work together, with two educational videos along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>While there is substantial and sophisticated <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/README.md">prior art</a>, particularly in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> community, for integrating verifiable credentials with OpenID Connect, using DIDs for OIDC is still emerging and approaching its first stable specification in the coming months. This is the culmination of substantial collaborative work to develop this bridge between the DID Authentication Working Group at DIF and various interlocutors at the OpenID Foundation. This post breaks down key elements of this development and shares more resources if you want to explore it&nbsp;further.</p> What is OpenID &amp; OpenID&nbsp;Connect <p>The first seeds of OpenID were sprouted at the very first Internet Identity Workshop in 2005. All the companies interested in URL-based protocols got together and collaborated together on their various models for designing authentication for users against URLs they controlled, like their personal blogs. This protocol has evolved and the latest iteration is based on sophisticated OAuth (Open Authorization) standards and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>The basic and most typical flow used by OpenID Connect can be described as follows: an individual, which in this context can be called a “user” of the identity system, first gets a fresh proof of authenticity of their digital identity. This unique proof is minted in the course of an interaction with a service called an “Identity Provider” (IP), i.e. Google or Facebook. This proof usually takes the form of a “token,” a single-use cryptographic access code linked to the corresponding identity record at the IP. The user then takes that token to a second site that they are going to login to, with is called the “Relying Party” or RP, which can then trust they are dealing with the same person identified (usually very strongly) by the Identity provider.</p>OpenID Login&nbsp;Flow<p>The teams of professionals that created OpenID Connect had enough imagination to anticipate more complex use-cases that weren’t immediately needed by the commercialized web of 2005, but for which the technical foundations were still worth laying. Among there, there was a clear idea that users would, in some cases, prefer or need to bring their own identity with them rather than a pointer to a record on an IP’s server. This identity would thus be “self-issued,” a capability they designed into the OpenID core specification.</p><p>The vision of DID-SIOP is a way of bringing decentralized identity concepts into alignment with the ideas of “self-issued” portable identity that the original OpenID innovators had. It was good that they included and preserved this underutilized capability in their immensely popular and internet-powering framework, which is the basis of modern social login (i.e., “Sign on with Google/Facebook/etc”). After all, it would have been simpler not to, but enough of designers and thinkers involved anticipated much of what has developed in parallel, the decentralized identity technology that the DIF serves to&nbsp;support.</p> How do decentralized identity systems&nbsp;work? <p>In this conceptual framework, the “Identity Provider” has been cut down a notch, and is instead referred to as a mere “Issuer” (of credentials and information, perhaps of identities over which it has less control).Similarly, the “user” is defined less by borrowed tools and more by owned ones, assuming the title of “Holder” of information and identity, whether issued or self-issued.. The “verifier” relies less on the identity provider, choosing instead to verify information and identities presented by their holder on their own terms (with some cryptographic assurances about the&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>One interesting difference between traditional OIDC and decentralized systems is that in the latter, all parties have identifiers that make it possible to verify signatures; it is hard to tell from a DID whether it corresponds to an institution, an individual, or an inanimate object, because it could be any or all of those. Whatever it represents, it points to ways of verifying signatures with so-called “key material” (public keys, hints to how to classify and use them). Most often, this happens by looking up the material on a distributed ledger, but this is not, strictly speaking, definitive of the framework..</p><p>The key material from an OIDC issuer proves the veracity of whatever information or identity is being presented in a way that is tied back to that issue by similar key-material guarantees, and a self-issued OIDC token works the same way. (In a self-issued OIDC credential, the holder’s key material is used in the place of an institutional issuer’s).</p> How OpenID and Decentralized ID can fit&nbsp;together <p>One of the big challenges for any new technology that needs an identity system is getting adoption of the needed components so the system can actually work at a sustainable scale. This usually required buy-in from various kinds of actors in an ecosystem: at the very least, it needs critical mass of users/holders, IPs/issuers, and RPs/verifiers, each maintaining their end of the infrastructure and “keeping the lights on,” as it&nbsp;were.</p><p>This is exactly where the two systems can really help each other: achieving and maintaining critical mass of all three, as the distribution of more and less centralized solutions changes, and self-issued credentials come to be accepted in theory and in practice. OpenID Connect has a large “install base”: there are literally millions of websites running OpenID Connect tooling as the authentication mechanism at their “front door” for users. Indeed, while a vanishingly small portion of internet users have ever heard of OIDC, it is the nuts and bolts of the most universal and familiar UX and user flow of the contemporary commercial web, including online banking and government services.</p><p>OIDC-SIOP leverages the code that OpenID Connect relying parties already have in place across all these millions of sites, and the lion’s share of the 10,000 most used websites. Think of the screen that reads, “Log in with Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github / etc.” OIDC-SIOP enables organizations to ask for Verifiable Credentials that an individual holds in their wallet instead of a token from Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github. These can be single-use access codes with cryptography built in, or more reusable credentials, or richer credentials containing various kinds of information otherwise requested from an IP. This mechanism is provided by the Self-Issued OpenID Provider flow described by the core specification:</p><p>If successful, this will be a huge win for decentralized identity, because it addresses the perennial “Relying Party” problem of adoption: how do you get relying parties to adopt a new technology, install and trust a new “doorway,” adapt their security and business processes to a new set of strengths and weaknesses? In the popular imagination and even in much of the technology press, scaling a business or a technology is often imagined as a quest for users, but they are often the easiest shareholder to get on board, particularly for something convenient and powerful. The relying parties (or, in economic terms, the “demand side” of identity) is often a much harder business problem, and in this case, no “big lift” is required of the verifiers or “relying party” consuming a new kind of authentication credentials because they only have to make minor adjustments to the nearly universal OIDC tooling they already&nbsp;have.</p> Further Reading <p>The purpose of the DID Authentication <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Working Group</a> at DIF is to design, recommend, and implement authentication protocols that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols tailored to today’s and tomorrow’s systems for handling DIDs and DID documents, the primitives of decentralized identities. In last six months, the group has been actively working on the OIDC bridge, and they presented their latest work at DIF’s June 2020 virtual “face to face”&nbsp;meeting:</p><p>Here is a link to their draft specification, nearing stability and ratification at time of press: <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">https://identity.foundation/did-siop/</a>. For an explanation of some of the design principles and conceptual fine points, see the article “<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">If You Build an Island You Need a Boat</a>” from DIF member Mattr Global&nbsp;(NZ).</p><p>Finally, if you want to go even deeper into the technical nitty gritty (particularly if you are unfamiliar with OIDC best practices), watch this video of a two hour presentation about OIDC-SIOP put on jointly with the DIDAuth group and the OpenID Foundation June 25th&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/where-to-begin-with-oidc-and-siop-7dd186c89796">Where to begin with OIDC and SIOP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Melissa Carvalho, Nicole Landry and Chanda Jackson represented Women in Identity at the 2020 IdentityNORTH annual summit where over 500 people attended a two day conference. While going virtual this year, the IdentityNORTH team was able to produce 3x more content than in previous years and offer a professional development certificate at 1/4 the price of their typical in-person events.</p>
<p>Before committing to the event, Melissa, Nicole and Chanda carefully analyzed the content to ensure that the summit reflects the values held by Women in Identity.</p>
<p>They were very impressed with the diversity of speakers – 46% of sessions featured speakers that are women, Indigenous or people of color. Sessions ranged from public and private sector business to health, democracy and inclusion and representation.</p>
<p>The team is pleased with the feedback obtained from other conference attendees. We’ve met many new people and look forward to building our relationships with those championing diversity in identity. We’re currently working with one of the groups, who would like to sponsor WiD, to launch a co-branded event this fall.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identitynorth.ca/downloads/IdentityNORTH-2020-Annual-Summit-Summary.pdf">IdentityNORTH 2020 Annual Summit event summary</a> can be found online. It’s a great source of information for those looking to learn more. In the summary, you’ll find that the IdentityNORTH team featured Women in Identity in the following excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s so important to understand when you build and deliver something to market, it’s not only going to be used for the purpose that you intended for, but it can be used for another purpose,” Chanda Jackson, Canadian Co-Lead of Women in Identity and Sr. Manager, IAM Planning at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) reminded participants. There’s a whole world of untapped potential and possibilities out there, Jackson noted – it’s time to open the door to more ways of thinking.</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. First use of a covert channel for a verifiable data registry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The image (meme) contains the multi codec representation of the public
&gt;&gt;&gt; key (same as is used by did:key)...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This means that the did document is recovered from data stored in an
&gt;&gt;&gt; image. (not encrypted!)... this technique is called
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is useful when you need to exchange messages without it being obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are doing so, for example:
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/didtwitt3r/status/1285446654112350209">https://twitter.com/didtwitt3r/status/1285446654112350209</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sadly this technique is often abused by the baddies, to hide botnet
&gt;&gt;&gt; command and control traffic on public platforms...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I would not consider steganography to be inherently good or
&gt;&gt;&gt; evil... it's just another way of encoding (not encrypting).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, the data goes on the public IPFS network... so thanks to
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://infura.io/">https://infura.io/</a> for making it possible to make this demo on a public

         <a>On the weekends, I get to work on whatever I want :)

Inspired by the new `did:twit` method, recently registered here:
</a><a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/pull/90">https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/pull/90</a>

I created `did:meme` (not registered yet...)

<a href="https://didme.me/did:meme:1zgswzdje885tzr8408m37sjmaa0sthw265ty6hmwzmau48kd809zzrgra4w5w">https://didme.me/did:meme:1zgswzdje885tzr8408m37sjmaa0sthw265ty6hmwzmau48kd809zzrgra4w5w</a>
<a href="https://github.com/OR13/didme.me">https://github.com/OR13/didme.me</a>

Obviously this is kind of a joke... However, I think there may be some
interesting technical firsts here, and if they are not firsts, I'm sure
readers of this mailing list will be able to correct me.

1. First use of bech32 to encode a did identifier

In order to make the DIDs look different from IPID / IPLD / IPFS / IPNS...
I transformed them using bech32.

2. First use of a covert channel for a verifiable data registry.

The image (meme) contains the multi codec representation of the public key
(same as is used by did:key)...

This means that the did document is recovered from data stored in an image.
(not encrypted!)... this technique is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography</a>

It is useful when you need to exchange messages without it being obvious
that you are doing so, for example:
<a href="https://twitter.com/didtwitt3r/status/1285446654112350209">https://twitter.com/didtwitt3r/status/1285446654112350209</a>

Sadly this technique is often abused by the baddies, to hide botnet command
and control traffic on public platforms...

However, I would not consider steganography to be inherently good or
evil... it's just another way of encoding (not encrypting).

Finally, the data goes on the public IPFS network... so thanks to
<a href="https://infura.io/">https://infura.io/</a> for making it possible to make this demo on a public
github pages backed website.

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is driving an array of new distributed technology models and applications. The potential for pairing IoT and blockchain is increasingly a hot topic. This month, as part of #HypereldgerIoT, we take a look at some productions examples where the technologies are already working together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for more about Hyperledger-powered IoT applications at work across a mix of use cases:</p>



<p>Norwegian Seafood Traceability Network</p>



<p>A recently launched Norwegian seafood traceability network leverages IBM Blockchain, which is built on Hyperledger Fabric, to share supply chain data throughout Norway’s seafood industry. The goal is to provide safer, better seafood to consumers worldwide. The network uses IoT sensors to report key environmental parameters. Starting with aquaculture, the sensors will monitor and report on the conditions required to produce high quality fish, such as water temperature, oxygen levels, and water quality, and when the fish are transported, IoT sensors will track and report factors such as the length of journey, temperature, and movement in transit. Several Norwegian seafood companies are now in the process of putting data onto the network.</p>



<p>My Sensor</p>



<p><a href="https://blockchain.telefonica.com/soluciones-para-tu-negocio/casos-de-exito/gas-radon">My Sensor</a> is an IoT device developed by Movistar that detects minute concentrations of Radon gas in the surroundings. Radon is a naturally occurring gas which may build up in your property in enclosed spaces, particularly in the basement and on lower floors. If Radon levels exceed certain thresholds, it can affect people’s health.</p>



<p>Leveraging <a href="https://trustos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Telefonica’s TrustOS</a> MQTT module, <a href="https://blockchain.telefonica.com/soluciones-para-tu-negocio/casos-de-exito/gas-radon">My Sensor</a> tracks and certifies the historical series of Radon gas concentration. The user can get a certification with full proof that guarantees the concentration did not exceed the thresholds in a period or did it during n measurements in a raw. The sensor sent the measurements through TrustOS to a Hyperledger Fabric network where some chaincodes are monitoring and certifying that the measures are in the expected range (or eventually are out of the range). The network itself certifies the series of measurements and anyone can verify it without any doubt avoiding the participation of a trusted expert third party.</p>



<p>VideoCoin Network</p>



<p>The <a href="http://videocoin.network">VideoCoin Network</a> is a decentralised video infrastructure that provides developers with video processing services that are simple to use and inexpensive compared to centralised providers. Developed by the VideoCoin Development Association Ltd. and implemented by services provider Live Planet, Inc., the VideoCoin Network runs on the <a href="https://publicmint.com/">Public Mint</a> platform and is enabled by a native protocol token, the VideoCoin (<a href="http://videocoin.io">VID</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Powered by a large-scale, distributed video infrastructure, the VideoCoin Network marshals under-utilised computing resources from around the world, including IoT devices, to revolutionise enterprise-grade video services with blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Public Mint provides a revolutionary and first of its kind money system that lets us use real USD as programmable currency&nbsp; allowing us to pay tens of thousands of participants on our network. This satisfies our needs to pay anyone whether they’re running a datacenter or a Raspberry Pi IoT device.” – Devadutta Ghat, CTO at LivePlanet Inc.</p>



<p>Backed by <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu">Hyperledger Besu</a> distributed ledger technology, Public Mint fosters a marketplace of <a href="https://publicmint.io/">Smart Services</a> that can run on top of Public Mint’s programmable fiat platform. Anyone can use the current Smart Services or build new ones, using <a href="https://developers.publicmint.io/">Public Mint’s Open APIs</a> and <a href="https://wallet.publicmint.io/welcome">open-source wallet</a>.</p>



<p>IoT devices integrity service</p>



<p>This service is an extra feature of the Hyperledger Fabric-based TrustOS product. A part of Telefonica’s <a href="https://trustos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">TrustOS</a> software, this library is provided to be executed by IoT devices in the secure boot. It adds as an additional HTTP header including a checksum of the secure boot for each request sent by the devices.</p>



<p>The first time a device sends this header, TrustOS creates an asset to track any variation in the device behaviour (including besides detecting new checksum, an IA assessing pace and frequency of the requests). Any request is registered and, if something unexpected is detected, a warning is triggered to quickly act over the affected device.</p>



<p>This service can’t avoid unauthorized tampering or unexpected updates but helps in identifying problems earlier and without any doubt. The result: it adds extra trustworthiness-proof beyond KPII.</p>

Individuals (demand) will have standardised API’s as will the manufacturers, distributors and retailers (supply). <br>  If you look at considered purchases in more detail, Google, Facebook and Amazon don’t actually try to do too much in those spaces other than hand off to sector level experts after the search phase. For example, if you do a google search for ’new car’ you get intermediaries at the top of the list as below. Behind the scenes the manufacturers are happy to let the intermediaries separate the wheat from the chaff (unless the search mentions them specifically).<br> <br>  Iain  <br>  <br> <br>

  Hi Johannes, as you say we are agreeing here; I don’t think this market will emerge through people wishing to directly sell their data. But as Susan says, one should not rule that out in some scenarios.    The scenarios you outline below are just not going to happen as they do not make economic sense for either party.

 I agree with Iain‘s example below. One of the most difficult aspects to address though will be how to overcome the market dominance of the established players (e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon). Under pressure they could offer a functionality as part of their
 services where a Me can do better intent casting (potentially also incentivized as they have deep pockets) and at the same time offer the B

 services where a Me can do better intent casting (potentially also incentivized as they have deep pockets) and at the same time offer the B‘s an integrated solution that tracks the successful conversions. 
 <br>
 
 Concrete example: Google offers a Me looking for a car (based on browsing behavior) USD 10 to participate in a 10-20 question survey regarding the details of the Me‘s car requirement (spec, brands, timing, budget etc.) and consent to share with car manufacturers
 / retailers. Then Google offers that information and the possibility to hand in an offer for USD 20 to 20 manufacturers and 20 car dealers, making USD 400 in revenues with that bit of information if everyone buys. Google might even use AI to browse the online
 inventories of manufacturers and retailers to select only those who would love to get a car (working capital) off their lot ASAP...&nbsp; 
 <br>
 
 It would be very hard (but not impossible with the right financial backing) to compete with the big ones, ending most likely in an acquisition by one of the big players and being integrated in Google search... 
 <br>
 
 My 2 cents.

 Those whose data was used should be fairly compensated. It’s complex, but like poverty and racism, the status quo must be changed. No perfect answers but a positive direction.&nbsp;

Manu,

The JSON-LD WG will transition, in the coming weeks, into a maintenance WG (one reason why this has not happened yet is due to my vacations…). This means setting up a similar structure as for VC: the technical work and further development will happen at the JSON for LD Community group[1]. The WG will only take care of 'maintenance', which may include publishing WG Notes like a CBOR-LD, but the technical discussions should happen in the CG.

All this to say that this work and discussion should also be happening on that CG, too; possibly the best is to simply take care of both mailing lists being on the cc list for this thread. But I leave this to you…

&gt; associated algorithms shipped. The JSON-LD 1.1 WG, with a huge thanks to
&gt; Gregg Kellogg, did yeoman's work getting us to an updated version of
&gt; JSON-LD 1.1. The official JSON-LD 1.1 Recommendation was finalized just
&gt; a week ago:
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/</a>
&gt; 
&gt; So, the difference is that the document worked on by the WG was a way to
&gt; encode JSON-LD in CBOR, whereas the thing that was just announced on
&gt; this mailing list was a way of compressing JSON-LD into a new format
&gt; called CBOR-LD that would enable a reduction in file size AND possibly
&gt; an increase in compute speed (neither of those were goals of the format
&gt; considered by the JSON-LD WG, IIRC).
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that CBOR-LD (the most recent announcement) will be what we focus
&gt; on as the months roll on... but I say that not having discussed any of
&gt; this with the JSON-LD WG... we'll have to see what Ivan, Gregg, and our
&gt; friends over there think about this new approach. Additionally, we need
&gt; to chat with Pierre-Antoine, who I believe did a lot of the work on
&gt; JSON-LD-CBOR to see if he feels there are key design criteria that we
&gt; missed when we put CBOR-LD together.

(e.g. asking nicely :-))  <br>  As above - same date but cheaper, or better data same price; or much better data, higher price&nbsp;  </blockquote> <br>  Can you describe the mechanics by which this is supposed to work?  <br>  In our example, You are trying to market a car to Me. You want to focus your marketing dollars on people who are likely going to buy that car, and not on those who aren’t. So far, so good.&nbsp;  <br>  You currently pay a third party for identifying prospects, such as Me, to You. You hand them money. They hand you a list of prospects. Ok. But you want to take that third party out of the equation, right?  <br>  So how do you identify prospects such as Me? Are you going to offer “everybody" some money to provide their requirements to you, and then you market your car only to those people whose data matches? Or …? (Because if so, I doubt that you’ll end up with less spend on lead generation. At least the math is not obvious.)  <br>  And how do you solve the problem of even communicating the “money for your data” offer to everybody? Don’t you have a similar marketing problem there, just for a different product (data, rather than car)? <br><blockquote>   <br>* How are you avoiding being gamed?  <br>  I only pay out when the purchase has been made and verified (either through myself or a competitor)   </blockquote> <br>  So You are telling Me, in our example: “Please provide this data to me, and if you buy a car within 3 months, I will give you $50” (or whatever the price).  <br>  I have a hard time seeing that I would do that. For one, the amount is small compared to the eventual price of the car, so I’d much rather resolve to negotiate a better purchase price if I indeed buy that car within 3 months. Also, I am quite certain I would come away with the impression that if You make offers like this, You most likely also just raised the prices of your cars by $50 which is not a good start if you want to sell me something. <br><blockquote>   <br>  I could fill in the above very easily for about 30 different sectors in which paying for qualified leads is absolutely business as usual.   </blockquote> <br> I agree that if this car example can be made to work, it will likely also work for other sectors.

 That’s a major part of the world and they need representation and real time resources. Their data is a vast resource for them. We can and should help them. And we should help ethical brands to connect with them in a fair data exchange relationship. And
 it seems to me that whatever we call it, it’s a marketplace and an exchange of value.&nbsp;

&gt;
&gt; It might be useful to see how different types of data encodings that are
&gt; commonly used fare. For example, it's useful to understand that because
&gt; base64-encoded JWTs use 6-bit encoding that things that could have
&gt; normally been LZ compressed cannot be compressed because of the
&gt; bit-carrying nature of base64's 6-bit encoding.
&gt;

We did some research on data encoding issues, with some tables at:

<a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-003-uri-binary-compatibility.md">https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-003-uri-binary-compatibility.md</a>

It turns out to be a lot more complicated when you add in QR to the
equation. Despite the "compression" of base64url running it through a QR
was actually less efficient than hexadecimal! This is because QR thinks it
is binary, and then expands it once again to the QR encoding format,
introducing a significant increase in size. In addition, it does not try to
internally compress binary. The careful selection of either the BC32
character set, or take advantage of some of the other benefits of ByteWords
encoding character set, allowed us to leverage the QR standard's internal
compression.

By carefully separating the transfer encoding scheme (to optimize for QR)
from the binary encoding scheme (CBOR), we were able to get a significantly
larger amount of data in a single QR. The problem with many other
approaches is that they try to do the transfer encoding scheme, the binary
encoding scheme, the self-describing encoding scheme, and the
error-detection encoding scheme all in the same layer. For instance, we
found Digital Bazaar's fountain encoding scheme for QRs to be at the wrong
layer, so proposed one that we believe provably works better with more
devices and smaller QR code frames, but does not have any cost at the
binary level.

What I'd like to see is how we might be able to combine these efforts, or
at least cooperate.

   To shed some light about the viability of selling personal data, on a non-trivial scale, by “consumers" to one or more “vendors" — which I think is the scenario being discussed — I suggest a thought experiment.  Let’s say I am willing to sell my personal data (I’m not, but let’s assume I am), any of it, as long as the price is right.  For the purposes of this experiment, let’s also assume that the

NOTE together for a "CBOR encoding for JSON-LD", which is slightly
different from what CBOR-LD is attempting to do (compression is a big
focus of CBOR-LD, not just encoding JSON-LD into CBOR).

The group had been (rightly) prioritizing getting JSON-LD 1.1 and
associated algorithms shipped. The JSON-LD 1.1 WG, with a huge thanks to
Gregg Kellogg, did yeoman's work getting us to an updated version of
JSON-LD 1.1. The official JSON-LD 1.1 Recommendation was finalized just
a week ago:

</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/</a>

So, the difference is that the document worked on by the WG was a way to
encode JSON-LD in CBOR, whereas the thing that was just announced on
this mailing list was a way of compressing JSON-LD into a new format
called CBOR-LD that would enable a reduction in file size AND possibly
an increase in compute speed (neither of those were goals of the format
considered by the JSON-LD WG, IIRC).

I hope that CBOR-LD (the most recent announcement) will be what we focus
on as the months roll on... but I say that not having discussed any of
this with the JSON-LD WG... we'll have to see what Ivan, Gregg, and our
friends over there think about this new approach. Additionally, we need
to chat with Pierre-Antoine, who I believe did a lot of the work on
JSON-LD-CBOR to see if he feels there are key design criteria that we
missed when we put CBOR-LD together.

It might be useful to see how different types of data encodings that are
commonly used fare. For example, it's useful to understand that because
base64-encoded JWTs use 6-bit encoding that things that could have
normally been LZ compressed cannot be compressed because of the
bit-carrying nature of base64's 6-bit encoding.

I was hoping to put together a test suite that would compare all this
stuff but ran out of time... but it looks like you did it instead, which
is great! :)

&gt; If you consider that changes to data on the wire would
&gt; cause the software to explode... you can see why agreeing to a common
&gt; context, is similar to agreeing to a data schema....
&gt; 
&gt; And by relying on an existing context to build a compressed binary
&gt; representation of a semantic object, we can leverage these "common
&gt; dictionaries / vocabularies" not just for semantic disambiguation, but
&gt; also for compression....&nbsp;

+1, exactly right!

There's a disconnect between your mental model and the way CBOR-LD works
currently, I'm trying to deduce where that disconnect is...

To directly answer your question above... the 1.2 version would be in
the context. It would literally be:

"@context": "</a><a href="https://example.com/myvocab/v1.1">https://example.com/myvocab/v1.1</a>"

and then you'd see it switch to:

"@context": "<a href="https://example.com/myvocab/v1.2">https://example.com/myvocab/v1.2</a>"

That's how you know someone changed from v1.1 to v1.2. It would be in
the input data. JSON-LD Context files can be, and are strongly urged to
be, versioned.

&gt; This is a good example of how to reduce size by switching from a
&gt; string representation to binary.  I assume we will find more of those
&gt; cases over time.   *BUT* a decoder needs to understand this encoding
&gt; approach - but again, how would they recognize something new?

... because there is a version byte on the CBOR Tag for CBOR-LD. At
present, the version is 0x00 (uncompressed CBOR), and (0x01 CBOR-LD
compression v1).

If we create new global decoders, we would bump the byte value up by one
to 0x02. The set of default codecs in play are always identified by the
CBOR-LD compression algorithm byte.

See Section 3.3 Compressed CBOR-LD Buffer Algorithm, Step #2:

<a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/#compressed-cbor-ld-buffer-algorithm">https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/#compressed-cbor-ld-buffer-algorithm</a>

&gt; At a minimum, we need a way to encode the version of the CBOR-SC
&gt; algorithm that is used to encode a given data set.   That would go a
&gt; *long way* to resolving my concerns.

Good! We already do that here:

<a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/#compressed-cbor-ld-buffer-algorithm">https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/#compressed-cbor-ld-buffer-algorithm</a>

Yes, the risks you outline are not entirely eliminated, but they are
lowered to the point that the risk is managable, IMHO.

If we take Dave Longley's advice of requiring JSON-LD Contexts
registered in the "CBOR-LD: Known Contexts" registry to also be
associated with a cryptographic hash value for each context, which I
think is a good requirement for the global registry, then have we
acceptably de-risked both of your concerns, Leonard?

&gt; Sorry I am late to the CBOR-LD Party!
&gt;
&gt; Very excited to have a semantic linked data format that is also usable in
&gt; a compact binary representation, and to have bi-directional
&gt; transformation out of the box... I have been playing with CBOR on the
&gt; weekends, and I have a repo here:
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/decentralized-cbor/blob/master/src/__fixtures__/outputs/table.csv">https://github.com/transmute-industries/decentralized-cbor/blob/master/src/__fixtures__/outputs/table.csv</a>
&gt;
&gt; The repo compares, JSON, JSON-LD, CBOR, DAG_CBOR and ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR (
&gt; another approach at compressed linked data format in CBOR)... I am eager to
&gt; add tests for CBOR-LD.
&gt;
&gt; both DAG_CBOR and CBOR-LD have some benefits over CBOR
&gt; and ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR and JSON....
&gt;
&gt; Both are linked data formats where the linked data aspect is preserved at
&gt; the binary level. ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR is just a compressed JSON-LD object
&gt; encoded as CBOR, you cannot leverage internal semantics... in much the same
&gt; way you cannot leverage internal semantics of "Pure JSON" and "Pure
&gt; CBOR".... However, ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR is MUCH smaller than DAG_CBOR /
&gt; "Pure CBOR" that was built from "Pure JSON", and CBOR-LD is MUCH smaller
&gt; than ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR...
&gt;
&gt; Backing up for a second, one way to think about why CBOR-LD is awesome is
&gt; to consider how all software that processes data, has some opinion about
&gt; that data... sometimes these opinions are encoded in schema validation of
&gt; incoming data (using tools like JSON Schema or ProtoBuff)... If you
&gt; consider that changes to data on the wire would cause the software to
&gt; explode... you can see why agreeing to a common context, is similar to
&gt; agreeing to a data schema....

&gt; representation of a semantic object, we can leverage these "common
&gt; dictionaries / vocabularies" not just for semantic disambiguation, but also
&gt; for compression....
&gt;

&gt;&gt; In that case you have picked a single schema, found all the items, and
&gt;&gt; given the unique value (let's say 1-10.).  Now (not shown on the slide,

&gt;&gt; values for it in the dictionary (eg. 11-20), and so on.   At some point the
&gt;&gt; credentials schema is updated (1.1-&gt;1.2) - but you can't update the
&gt;&gt; existing entries in the dictionary and just add the new ones to the end
&gt;&gt; (eg. 100-105).  And then you encode something using that dictionary - how
&gt;&gt; does something downstream know that you are using the 1.2 version of the
&gt;&gt; context?  It would simply have a 100 in there - but w/o that in the

&gt;&gt;     &gt; However, the main use case that you present in the presentation is
&gt;&gt;     &gt; QRCodes - which exist as a mechanism to move from digital to analog
&gt;&gt;     &gt; (and back).   The analog world is long lived - even if not
&gt;&gt;     &gt; necessarily archival - and the data needs to be retrievable.  And
&gt;&gt;     &gt; that can't happen w/o knowing the right (version of the) dictionary
&gt;&gt;     &gt; to use.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     ... which is why we strongly suggest that all production contexts
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;     be versioned, frozen, and cryptographically hashed. There is a general
&gt;&gt;     mitigation for your concern. :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     To be clear, this issue is well known in the JSON-LD ecosystem and
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;     ecosystem has thrived (deployed on tens of millions of domains) in
&gt;&gt; spite
&gt;&gt;     of the danger. That community has learned how to manage constantly
&gt;&gt;     evolving vocabularies (schema.org), and how to lock vocabularies
&gt;&gt; down (VCs).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     There are solutions to the problem you outline, cryptographically
&gt;&gt;     hashing URLs is one thing we explored, but that bloats the size of the
&gt;&gt;     CBOR-LD bytes. Like any technology, CBOR-LD is a series of difficult
&gt;&gt;     design trade-offs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Just like we made the conscious decision in JSON-LD to be able to
&gt;&gt;     reference external JSON-LD Context files (which people insisted was
&gt;&gt;     madness and unworkable when we did it... and still do), we make the
&gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt;     conscious decision now (because it worked out pretty well for JSON-LD,
&gt;&gt;     and it's not clear how doing the same thing in CBOR-LD would be any
&gt;&gt;     different).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     If we wanted to eliminate the risk you highlighted, we wouldn't be
&gt;&gt; able
&gt;&gt;     to solve the most pressing use cases.

&gt; Hi Nader, thanks for sharing to the list and for your well-written
&gt; summary. I think it's important to engage governments to help them
&gt; understand how technology based on our standards can help protect their
&gt; citizens and to ensure that recommendations/regulatory requirements make
&gt; room for or even encourage the adoption of global standards that are
&gt; inclusively designed. When we don't do this, we run into difficult
&gt; situations: for example, that the secp256k1 curve is not a NIST curve has
&gt; caused a divide between enterprise and government usage of smart contract
&gt; infrastructure. We have a chance to bridge chasms now.
&gt;
&gt; I'd be interested in collaborating with you to create a Work Item within
&gt; CCG to synthesize the relevant parts of the guidelines, organize a
&gt; community response, and coordinate guidance from those who have experience
&gt; with providing impactful feedback to NIST over the next 19 days. If you're
&gt; open in this approach, I would recommend proposing a new work item using
&gt; this link:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose</a>
&gt;
&gt; I am happy to then accept responsibility as a co-owner of this Proposed
&gt; Work Item, which would help turn this into an official Work Item since we
&gt; will have two different parties. You can read about the full process here:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit</a>#
&gt;
&gt; We can have more than two owners on a Work Item, in case anyone else on
&gt; this list is interested. Also Nader, please feel no obligation to take this
&gt; on as your Work Item should your schedule or other commitments disallow. If
&gt; no action in two days, I will make a new Proposed Work Item issue and bump
&gt; this thread due to the short timeline, and invite participation to the
&gt; GitHub issue.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; It came to my attention that NIST is currently in an open review period on
&gt; their Digital Identity Guidelines as published under NIST 800-63-3.
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/4/draft">https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/4/draft</a>
&gt; Deadline: August 10
&gt;
&gt; They're seeking feedback on a wide variety of topics to improve the
&gt; standard, including remote identity proofing, mitigating correlation, and
&gt; biometric verification. The scope of these regulations is very broad and
&gt; the open review period seems like a substantial opportunity to provide our
&gt; input as a community on some practical, real-world identity regulations.
&gt; I'm sure some of us have already started thinking about this, how might we
&gt; get organized?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Nader

         Stepping back to ask a simple question:

What is the relationship or the difference between this new DB spec:
https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/

And this existing (and sparsely populated) draft spec at the W3C:
https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-cbor/

Is the former spec simply an evolution of the latter? What’s the delta

&gt; Sorry I am late to the CBOR-LD Party!
&gt;
&gt; Very excited to have a semantic linked data format that is also usable in
&gt; a compact binary representation, and to have bi-directional
&gt; transformation out of the box... I have been playing with CBOR on the
&gt; weekends, and I have a repo here:
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/decentralized-cbor/blob/master/src/__fixtures__/outputs/table.csv">https://github.com/transmute-industries/decentralized-cbor/blob/master/src/__fixtures__/outputs/table.csv</a>
&gt;
&gt; The repo compares, JSON, JSON-LD, CBOR, DAG_CBOR and ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR (
&gt; another approach at compressed linked data format in CBOR)... I am eager to
&gt; add tests for CBOR-LD.
&gt;
&gt; both DAG_CBOR and CBOR-LD have some benefits over CBOR
&gt; and ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR and JSON....
&gt;
&gt; Both are linked data formats where the linked data aspect is preserved at
&gt; the binary level. ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR is just a compressed JSON-LD object
&gt; encoded as CBOR, you cannot leverage internal semantics... in much the same
&gt; way you cannot leverage internal semantics of "Pure JSON" and "Pure
&gt; CBOR".... However, ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR is MUCH smaller than DAG_CBOR /
&gt; "Pure CBOR" that was built from "Pure JSON", and CBOR-LD is MUCH smaller
&gt; than ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR...
&gt;
&gt; Backing up for a second, one way to think about why CBOR-LD is awesome is
&gt; to consider how all software that processes data, has some opinion about
&gt; that data... sometimes these opinions are encoded in schema validation of
&gt; incoming data (using tools like JSON Schema or ProtoBuff)... If you
&gt; consider that changes to data on the wire would cause the software to
&gt; explode... you can see why agreeing to a common context, is similar to
&gt; agreeing to a data schema....
&gt;
&gt; And by relying on an existing context to build a compressed binary
&gt; representation of a semantic object, we can leverage these "common
&gt; dictionaries / vocabularies" not just for semantic disambiguation, but also
&gt; for compression....
&gt;
&gt; Obviously the IoT space has been waiting for something like this for a
&gt; long time...
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; We are now able to convert all these ontologies and semantic vocabularies,
&gt; into compact, interoperable, binary representations for industries that
&gt; have already committed to the semantic web:
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web#ontologies">https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web#ontologies</a>
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure of the potential internal representation benefits for
&gt; services like <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph</a> but
&gt; obviously, a small IOT device that only speaks CBOR-LD would not need to
&gt; crack out a JSON parser and all the attack surface associated with it, just
&gt; to talk to the knowledge graph service.

&gt;&gt; values for it in the dictionary (eg. 11-20), and so on.   At some point the
&gt;&gt; credentials schema is updated (1.1-&gt;1.2) - but you can't update the
&gt;&gt; existing entries in the dictionary and just add the new ones to the end
&gt;&gt; (eg. 100-105).  And then you encode something using that dictionary - how
&gt;&gt; does something downstream know that you are using the 1.2 version of the
&gt;&gt; context?  It would simply have a 100 in there - but w/o that in the
&gt;&gt; dictionary, it's not decodable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Slide 14:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is a good example of how to reduce size by switching from a string
&gt;&gt; representation to binary.  I assume we will find more of those cases over
&gt;&gt; time.   *BUT* a decoder needs to understand this encoding approach - but
&gt;&gt; again, how would they recognize something new?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At a minimum, we need a way to encode the version of the CBOR-SC
&gt;&gt; algorithm that is used to encode a given data set.   That would go a *long
&gt;&gt; way* to resolving my concerns.

&gt;&gt;     &gt; However, the main use case that you present in the presentation is
&gt;&gt;     &gt; QRCodes - which exist as a mechanism to move from digital to analog

&gt;&gt;     &gt; necessarily archival - and the data needs to be retrievable.  And
&gt;&gt;     &gt; that can't happen w/o knowing the right (version of the) dictionary
&gt;&gt;     &gt; to use.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     ... which is why we strongly suggest that all production contexts
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;     be versioned, frozen, and cryptographically hashed. There is a general
&gt;&gt;     mitigation for your concern. :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     To be clear, this issue is well known in the JSON-LD ecosystem and
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;     ecosystem has thrived (deployed on tens of millions of domains) in
&gt;&gt; spite
&gt;&gt;     of the danger. That community has learned how to manage constantly
&gt;&gt;     evolving vocabularies (schema.org), and how to lock vocabularies
&gt;&gt; down (VCs).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     There are solutions to the problem you outline, cryptographically
&gt;&gt;     hashing URLs is one thing we explored, but that bloats the size of the
&gt;&gt;     CBOR-LD bytes. Like any technology, CBOR-LD is a series of difficult
&gt;&gt;     design trade-offs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Just like we made the conscious decision in JSON-LD to be able to
&gt;&gt;     reference external JSON-LD Context files (which people insisted was
&gt;&gt;     madness and unworkable when we did it... and still do), we make the
&gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt;     conscious decision now (because it worked out pretty well for JSON-LD,
&gt;&gt;     and it's not clear how doing the same thing in CBOR-LD would be any
&gt;&gt;     different).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     If we wanted to eliminate the risk you highlighted, we wouldn't be
&gt;&gt; able
&gt;&gt;     to solve the most pressing use cases.

         <a>Sorry I am late to the CBOR-LD Party!

Very excited to have a semantic linked data format that is also usable in a
compact binary representation, and to have bi-directional
transformation out of the box... I have been playing with CBOR on the
weekends, and I have a repo here:
</a><a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/decentralized-cbor/blob/master/src/__fixtures__/outputs/table.csv">https://github.com/transmute-industries/decentralized-cbor/blob/master/src/__fixtures__/outputs/table.csv</a>

The repo compares, JSON, JSON-LD, CBOR, DAG_CBOR and ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR (
another approach at compressed linked data format in CBOR)... I am eager to
add tests for CBOR-LD.

both DAG_CBOR and CBOR-LD have some benefits over CBOR
and ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR and JSON....

Both are linked data formats where the linked data aspect is preserved at
the binary level. ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR is just a compressed JSON-LD object
encoded as CBOR, you cannot leverage internal semantics... in much the same
way you cannot leverage internal semantics of "Pure JSON" and "Pure
CBOR".... However, ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR is MUCH smaller than DAG_CBOR /
"Pure CBOR" that was built from "Pure JSON", and CBOR-LD is MUCH smaller
than ZLIB_URDNA2015_CBOR...

Backing up for a second, one way to think about why CBOR-LD is awesome is
to consider how all software that processes data, has some opinion about
that data... sometimes these opinions are encoded in schema validation of
incoming data (using tools like JSON Schema or ProtoBuff)... If you
consider that changes to data on the wire would cause the software to
explode... you can see why agreeing to a common context, is similar to
agreeing to a data schema....

And by relying on an existing context to build a compressed binary
representation of a semantic object, we can leverage these "common
dictionaries / vocabularies" not just for semantic disambiguation, but also
for compression....

Obviously the IoT space has been waiting for something like this for a long
time...

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">https://www.w3.org/WoT/</a>

<a href="https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md">https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md</a>

We are now able to convert all these ontologies and semantic vocabularies,
into compact, interoperable, binary representations for industries that
have already committed to the semantic web:
<a href="https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web#ontologies">https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web#ontologies</a>

I'm not sure of the potential internal representation benefits for services
like <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph</a> but obviously, a small
IOT device that only speaks CBOR-LD would not need to crack out a JSON
parser and all the attack surface associated with it, just to talk to the
knowledge graph service.

&gt; Hi Nader, thanks for sharing to the list and for your well-written summary. I think it's important to engage governments to help them understand how technology based on our standards can help protect their citizens and to ensure that recommendations/regulatory requirements make room for or even encourage the adoption of global standards that are inclusively designed. When we don't do this, we run into difficult situations: for example, that the secp256k1 curve is not a NIST curve has caused a divide between enterprise and government usage of smart contract infrastructure. We have a chance to bridge chasms now.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be interested in collaborating with you to create a Work Item within CCG to synthesize the relevant parts of the guidelines, organize a community response, and coordinate guidance from those who have experience with providing impactful feedback to NIST over the next 19 days. If you're open in this approach, I would recommend proposing a new work item using this link:
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I am happy to then accept responsibility as a co-owner of this Proposed Work Item, which would help turn this into an official Work Item since we will have two different parties. You can read about the full process here:
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit</a>#
&gt; 
&gt; We can have more than two owners on a Work Item, in case anyone else on this list is interested. Also Nader, please feel no obligation to take this on as your Work Item should your schedule or other commitments disallow. If no action in two days, I will make a new Proposed Work Item issue and bump this thread due to the short timeline, and invite participation to the GitHub issue.

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It came to my attention that NIST is currently in an open review period on their Digital Identity Guidelines as published under NIST 800-63-3.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/4/draft">https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/4/draft</a>
&gt;&gt; Deadline: August 10
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; They're seeking feedback on a wide variety of topics to improve the standard, including remote identity proofing, mitigating correlation, and biometric verification. The scope of these regulations is very broad and the open review period seems like a substantial opportunity to provide our input as a community on some practical, real-world identity regulations. I'm sure some of us have already started thinking about this, how might we get organized?

         It's not just specific schemas but also the order of the schemas, any other keys you add, plus additional "techniques" you add.

Using your presentation as a guide:

Now (not shown on the slide, but...), I assume that you then pick another schema and start allocating values for it in the dictionary (eg. 11-20), and so on.   At some point the credentials schema is updated (1.1-&gt;1.2) - but you can't update the existing entries in the dictionary and just add the new ones to the end (eg. 100-105).  And then you encode something using that dictionary - how does something downstream know that you are using the 1.2 version of the context?  It would simply have a 100 in there - but w/o that in the dictionary, it's not decodable.

 
Slide 14:

This is a good example of how to reduce size by switching from a string representation to binary.  I assume we will find more of those cases over time.   *BUT* a decoder needs to understand this encoding approach - but again, how would they recognize something new?

yes, although it's pre-filled froman external schema where available.
Very small packets was an EXI use case - IoT uses EXI.

&gt; * EXI doesn't attempt to compress data, CBOR-LD will do
&gt;   compression for values it understands. For example,
&gt;   EXI will put DateTimes "2018-04-12T14:23:13Z" (39 bytes with
&gt;   tag in XML) in a compression dictionary WITHOUT converting
&gt;   them to binary formats, where as CBOR-LD will
&gt;   compress that down to a 7 byte binary value... a 557%
&gt;   compression ratio. See[1], slide 14.

This is not in general true - data model types can be transmitted in
binary - and tags are not transmitted where they can be deduced. In
fact, tags are not transmitted at all with EXI, as what is transmitted
is parse events, the *result* of parsing. As a result, less memory is
needed to decompress an EXI stream than for example zip.

Thanks,

Liam

We should strongly recommend that any context registered in a CBOR-LD
global registry be a static document and include a content hash along
with it. A registered context should not change. This is similar to the
fact that the VC context is a versioned and static context -- and VC
issuers that create their own contexts should follow the same advice.

&gt; 
&gt;     You are correct, if the schema changes out from under you, you're in
&gt;     trouble. There is one mitigation for this that you may not be aware of:
&gt; 
&gt;     Every W3C global standard JSON-LD Context that I know of is frozen in
&gt;     time. We go as far as publishing cryptographic hashes for the JSON-LD
&gt;     Contexts in the specifications themselves.
&gt; 
&gt;     Example for Verifiable Credentials here:
&gt; 
&gt;     <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fvc-data-model%2F%23base-context&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C87e433fae0e04f49944a08d82fdfdcc4%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637311985813780797&amp;amp;sdat">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fvc-data-model%2F%23base-context&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C87e433fae0e04f49944a08d82fdfdcc4%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637311985813780797&amp;sdat</a>a=B%2BBpxqMIZdULrUx3bf7d0JGAONm5yEv%2FucEescfTd2U%3D&amp;reserved=0
&gt; 
&gt;     We should point this out in the CBOR-LD specification as I'm sure some
&gt;     poor soul will step on that particular landmine.
&gt; 
&gt;     The other protection that we have in place is that things like
&gt;     Verifiable Credentials are digitally signed, so if you deserialize and
&gt;     check the signature on the receiving end, a context change will be
&gt;     detected (digital signature verification failure).
&gt; 
&gt;     That doesn't mean that this stuff isn't useful even while developing...
&gt;     if you only go to CBOR-LD for vanishingly small periods of time
&gt;     (transmission via QRCode and then immediately back to JSON-LD), it is
&gt;     highly unlikely that you're going to be the unlucky person that received
&gt;     a message right as someone pressed "Save" a context.
&gt; 
&gt;     So, if you plan to use CBOR-LD as an archival format using unstable
&gt;     JSON-LD Context files, then yes, you shouldn't do that and yes, we
&gt;     should warn about it in the specification. However, that doesn't mean
&gt;     that the solution isn't viable for a subset of use cases. :)

... which is why we strongly suggest that all production contexts should
be versioned, frozen, and cryptographically hashed. There is a general
mitigation for your concern. :)

To be clear, this issue is well known in the JSON-LD ecosystem and that
ecosystem has thrived (deployed on tens of millions of domains) in spite
of the danger. That community has learned how to manage constantly
evolving vocabularies (schema.org), and how to lock vocabularies down (VCs).

There are solutions to the problem you outline, cryptographically
hashing URLs is one thing we explored, but that bloats the size of the
CBOR-LD bytes. Like any technology, CBOR-LD is a series of difficult
design trade-offs.

Just like we made the conscious decision in JSON-LD to be able to
reference external JSON-LD Context files (which people insisted was
madness and unworkable when we did it... and still do), we make the same
conscious decision now (because it worked out pretty well for JSON-LD,
and it's not clear how doing the same thing in CBOR-LD would be any
different).

If we wanted to eliminate the risk you highlighted, we wouldn't be able
to solve the most pressing use cases.

Here are just a few of the differences that I know of between EXI and
CBOR-LD (you'll have to forgive me, I'm not an EXI expert):

* EXI embeds its compression dictionary resulting in larger
  data sizes, CBOR-LD builds it's compression dictionary
  using a stable external resource. This matters for very
  small payloads &lt; 1KB in size.

* EXI doesn't attempt to compress data, CBOR-LD will do
  compression for values it understands. For example,
  EXI will put DateTimes "2018-04-12T14:23:13Z" (39 bytes with
  tag in XML) in a compression dictionary WITHOUT converting
  them to binary formats, where as CBOR-LD will
  compress that down to a 7 byte binary value... a 557%
  compression ratio. See[1], slide 14.

Other than those two (key) items, there are a lot of similarities
between CBOR-LD and just about any other structured data format
compression technique. For example, you can apply LZ-compression
(gzip/Deflate) on top of CBOR-LD and get further compression for
repeated binary/string values... IF you have repeated content in your
data (like a DID Document would).

         <a>Manu - I agree that there is a problem to be solved here, and I appreciate the work that you and your team has done to architect one possible approach.

While the use of a pre-defined dictionary approach to improving compression ratios is well established and proven - there is a reason that it isn't used for data that is "long lived" -  versioning (or lack thereof).  There is no way to for a given decoder to know what version of the dictionary was used to compress the data - and (of course) they must match.  In our world where (standard) schemas are being created &amp; edited daily, let alone the existence of custom ones - I just don't see how this will work for the types of data being considered here (eg. VC's)

Accordingly, I don’t see this as a viable option.

    Hi W3C Credentials Community Group,

    This email introduces CBOR-LD, the Concise Binary Object Representation
    for Linked Data.

    CBOR-LD provides a general purpose algorithm to compress JSON-LD
    documents, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized
    Identifier Documents, to a compact binary representation. Using this new
    technology, it is possible to achieve compression ratios north of 300%,
    resulting in new ecosystem capabilities like being able to squeeze a
    digitally signed Verifiable Credential into a relatively small QR Code,
    store 3x as many VCs in a digital wallet, and other gains in storage
    efficiency. The algorithm is generalized and is able to achieve these
    gains for many types of JSON-LD inputs.

    An introductory presentation on CBOR-LD is attached as a PDF. The latest
    copy of the presentation is here:

    There is an implementation of the concepts outlined in the presentation
    above here in Node.js (browser-based version coming soon-ish):

    <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdigitalbazaar%2Fcborld&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7Cbb5d3dcf7f9649b82ed508d82f74029a%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637311522622748710&amp;amp;sdata=wGkL11DNkMA2">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdigitalbazaar%2Fcborld&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7Cbb5d3dcf7f9649b82ed508d82f74029a%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637311522622748710&amp;sdata=wGkL11DNkMA2</a>op9Pilk01TSsecy2SsuH5e1K%2BDsHlsY%3D&amp;reserved=0

    A very rough specification is forming here:

    <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdigitalbazaar.github.io%2Fcbor-ld-spec%2F&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7Cbb5d3dcf7f9649b82ed508d82f74029a%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637311522622748710&amp;amp;sdata=iTgZGM">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdigitalbazaar.github.io%2Fcbor-ld-spec%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7Cbb5d3dcf7f9649b82ed508d82f74029a%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637311522622748710&amp;sdata=iTgZGM</a>ByqoeE3E6bbnhmiXK3xDzFt88ln9XVsJxtwnI%3D&amp;reserved=0

    This is mostly just a notification of work that is ready for public
    circulation, discussion, and feedback. Digital Bazaar feels pretty
    confident in the direction of the work at this point, but also cautions
    that this is merely a start and there will need to be many more months
    of work put into it to discover bugs, finalize the general algorithm,
    and perform other nascent technology gyrations. We would not recommend
    that anyone implement the technology at this time without reading the
    source implementation above. There are known bugs and this technology
    isn't ready for prime time -- DO NOT use it for production deployments
    unless you really know what you're doing -- expect things to change.

    We will have a public presentation on CBOR-LD in a few weeks and will
    let this group know when and where that is happening. In the meantime,
    questions and feedback via the mailing list and via the appropriate
    Github issue tracker is appreciated.

    W3C CCG Chairs, the intent here is to NOT make this a CCG work item and
    instead send it through the JSON-LD CG/WG. That said, the technology
    could have a significant impact on the work in this community and we
    are, therefore, requesting time to discuss it on a future CCG call (with
    invitations sent to other W3C WGs like JSON-LD, VCWG, DID WG, Web of
    Things WG, etc.). Thoughts?

<p>In advance of our inaugural Investing in Identity Digital&nbsp;<a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/july-investor-forum">Forum</a>—where we’ll unite with investors, prospecting startup founders, and market analysts— the OWI team is here to whet your appetite with some&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/tag/dealbook/">DealBook</a>&nbsp;highlights from the first half of the year. Study up here on some of the most significant identity deal trends and highlights before diving into the Forum next week to learn more about funding in the growing, dynamic identity industry.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity has seen unprecedented levels of deal-making, with identity management, verification, and authentication companies becoming a crown jewel for VCs. As the enterprise shifts to cloud-based data centers and security, digital identity solutions promise big money—really&nbsp;big money (we’re talking $7B in 2019). Now,&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/the-role-of-digital-identity-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;has caused a seismic acceleration of online identity verification and digital account opening, with VCs eyeing the next wave of darlings doubling down on digital transformation</p>



<p>So far, OWI has tracked 82 deals in 2020. We’ve synthesized just a few of the many highlights of the first half of the year, reopening the insights shared in our&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/tag/dealbook/">weekly DealBook</a>:</p>



<p>Largest deals</p>



<p>The single largest deal we tracked through the first half of the year was Visa’s acquisition of Plaid in January to the tune of $5.3 billion. As a platform that integrates transactions and personal data like phone numbers and bank accounts, Visa’s acquisition of Plaid at roughly twice its final valuation represents a seismic deal in the identity sector.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the largest divestiture tracked was the February sale of RSA by Dell Technologies to a consortium of investors. Outside of M&amp;A, the most significant fundraising was Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s recent IPO to raise $1 billion and AppsFlyer’s $210 million funding round, also in January.</p>



<p>Average deal size</p>



<p>OWI has seen an average deal size of $162 million across all deals tracked year-to-date. Excluding M&amp;A and IPOs to look at funding rounds only, deals have averaged $41 million in the first half of the year.</p>



<p>Most active investors</p>



<p>In terms of most deals by count, we clocked in a tie between Index Ventures and Y Combinators at four deals apiece. As for deal size, Visa comes out as the top investor solely for its important acquisition of Plaid. The largest funder based on deal participation, however, is Accel, having participated in $372 million worth of deals across three funding rounds: ForgeRock, Privitar, and SentinelOne.</p>

<p>Our Analyst Take: Investor Trends</p>



<p>To nobody’s surprise, the&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/the-role-of-digital-identity-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;pandemic impacted some of the investment trends we’ve seen over the first half of the year, particularly since March when lockdowns spread across much of the world:</p>



  Digital onboarding&nbsp;– Since March we’ve seen a steady and marked sequence of deals related to automated onboarding and digital identity verification: Onfido in April ($100 million), PXL Vision in May ($4.8 million), Vetty in June ($4 million), and Global Data Consortium in July ($3.5 million).  Telehealth&nbsp;– We also saw notable funding rounds for telehealth companies like Medici ($24 million) and Alan (EUR 50 million), both in April, as people around the world sought new ways of accessing services like medical care from home lockdown.  Remote access&nbsp;– In May, Secret Double Octopus had a $15 million funding round, to meet a “rapidly growing need” for remote-access security, especially as more enterprise employees began working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.  



<p>As noted above, identity investment has been active, raising a collective $7 billion in 2019. With this activity from the first half of 2020, are we simply seeing a continuation of that investor interest, or do you think the COVID-19 pandemic—and the need for more secure, remote solutions—has meaningfully accelerated identity investment?</p>



<p>If identity investor topics and highlights like these have piqued your interest, don’t miss the Investor Forum next week—<a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/july-investor-forum">view the agenda and apply to attend</a>&nbsp;now. We’ll continue this particular conversation in the session on “Identity Investments During a Black Swan Event.” You can expect to dive deeper into investing trends directly from those leading the charge and gain further insider insight into digital identity use cases, startups, and business models poised to disrupt the data economy.</p>

         Hi W3C Credentials Community Group,

This email introduces CBOR-LD, the Concise Binary Object Representation
for Linked Data.

CBOR-LD provides a general purpose algorithm to compress JSON-LD
documents, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized
Identifier Documents, to a compact binary representation. Using this new
technology, it is possible to achieve compression ratios

         <a>Hi W3C Credentials Community Group,

This email introduces CBOR-LD, the Concise Binary Object Representation
for Linked Data.

CBOR-LD provides a general purpose algorithm to compress JSON-LD
documents, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized
Identifier Documents, to a compact binary representation. Using this new
technology, it is possible to achieve compression ratios north of 300%,
resulting in new ecosystem capabilities like being able to squeeze a
digitally signed Verifiable Credential into a relatively small QR Code,
store 3x as many VCs in a digital wallet, and other gains in storage
efficiency. The algorithm is generalized and is able to achieve these
gains for many types of JSON-LD inputs.

An introductory presentation on CBOR-LD is attached as a PDF. The latest
copy of the presentation is here:

</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ksh-gUdjJJwDpdleasvs9aRXEmeRvqhkVWqeitx5ZAE/edit">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ksh-gUdjJJwDpdleasvs9aRXEmeRvqhkVWqeitx5ZAE/edit</a>

There is an implementation of the concepts outlined in the presentation
above here in Node.js (browser-based version coming soon-ish):

<a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/cborld">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/cborld</a>

A very rough specification is forming here:

<a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/">https://digitalbazaar.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/</a>

This is mostly just a notification of work that is ready for public
circulation, discussion, and feedback. Digital Bazaar feels pretty
confident in the direction of the work at this point, but also cautions
that this is merely a start and there will need to be many more months
of work put into it to discover bugs, finalize the general algorithm,
and perform other nascent technology gyrations. We would not recommend
that anyone implement the technology at this time without reading the
source implementation above. There are known bugs and this technology
isn't ready for prime time -- DO NOT use it for production deployments
unless you really know what you're doing -- expect things to change.

We will have a public presentation on CBOR-LD in a few weeks and will
let this group know when and where that is happening. In the meantime,
questions and feedback via the mailing list and via the appropriate
Github issue tracker is appreciated.

W3C CCG Chairs, the intent here is to NOT make this a CCG work item and
instead send it through the JSON-LD CG/WG. That said, the technology
could have a significant impact on the work in this community and we
are, therefore, requesting time to discuss it on a future CCG call (with
invitations sent to other W3C WGs like JSON-LD, VCWG, DID WG, Web of
Things WG, etc.). Thoughts?

Iain and Milton - &nbsp;I am interested in the topic of data valuation as well. &nbsp;Please consider my request to be included in that discussion/information flow. 
 
<br>
 
 
Here are a couple of random ideas that may or may not be useful in the analysis: 
 
<br>
 
 
 
 Value in what market? &nbsp;Price discovery is a feature of markets. &nbsp;Data is traded in black market, advertising market, etc., each with its own usage
 patterns and value propositions for stakeholders.  Intrinsic value or extrinsic value of data? Where one instance of data can "inform" parties in multiple contexts (and is of value to each of them),
 what method should apply to "average" or account for the price discrepancies?  Reasoning by analogy since IP laws don't directly protect usage of data), International businesses frequently use IP laws (copyright, patent, TM)
 to divide territory for their sales and brand strategies. Resale of their product is prohibited by their government-granted IP monopoly in the form of IP rights. In a post Schrems-II world, will data localization rules become the vehicle for market-segregation
 for commercial applications of personal data. &nbsp;If so, will people have "private rights of action" (as opposed to government enforcement) and "class action" rights to pursue their rights to benefit from the data-localization rules? &nbsp;On the latter, note that
 some TOS/TOUs have started to limit class actions as part of their arbitration rules, following in the footsteps of the credit card companies, etc.  Are valuation approaches useful? &nbsp;For example, real estate is typically valued by some combination of comparable sales, income generation and cost.
 &nbsp;Are subsets of that and similar analyses useful here? &nbsp;Is this analysis affected by the resistance to viewing data as property? &nbsp;Are those issues ameliorated by considering "data rights" (but not data itself) as "intangible property" akin to other contractual/statutory/regulatory
 rights?  Consider valuation that is based on the value of the thing exchanged for data. &nbsp;(Compare tax case: Philadelphia Park Amusement Company (the "rainbow
 bridge" case).  Consider dynamic issues in valuation and how value can change over time. Information about a newly famous person increases in value as their fame
 grows. etc. &nbsp;(Compare "amortization" issues in "Associated Patentees" case that allowed for amortization deductions for patent creation costs proportional to the accumulated income generation experience from the patents, which changed over the years).  If, and to the extent, that "data plus meaning equals information" is data valuation necessary but insufficient for information value determination.
 &nbsp;What are the mechanisms for understanding the value of "meaning" and information? &nbsp;Is it "avoided costs" in the case where being informed enabled a party to mitigate risks in future interactions? &nbsp;What about situations where the informed party seeks "leverage"
 rather than just "risk reduction?" &nbsp;In the case of leverage, would data costs be included in the cost of services provided? &nbsp;Might a VAT (Value added tax) type model or analysis help to parse the relative contributions of data and meaning to information applied
 in future interactions?  What, if any, role do statutory penalties for data breach play in determining value? &nbsp;Are there other mechanisms by which the calculation of compensation
 for damages associated with data misuse, negligence, exceeding authority, etc. could inform data "value"  Is it tractable to assert that the value could be ascribed by reference to the value of the companies that exploit it. &nbsp;Is the value of facebook
 data about person X equal to the market capitalization of facebook, minus its costs of operation, divided by the number of facebook users? &nbsp;Would valuation of cooperatives (mutual insurance companies, credit unions, dairy coops, etc.) be helpful in valuing
 parts of companies supported ultimately by data flows.  To what extent is data a "commodity" versus more like a "bespoke" product or service? &nbsp;Is data sufficiently fungible so that it can be valued in
 general (like corn or other items for which the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) allows for "cover")? &nbsp;If data in general is not fungible, are there elements of data rights that are sufficiently fungible to lend themselves to trading at large scales and in large
 markets where "value" would be less subject to manipulation by a few large players.  How will "data markets" affect pricing of data? &nbsp;It would have the indirect effect of making "losses" from data breaches more calculable (if data
 value is set in independent markets). &nbsp;Of course, just knowing the value of data is not enough to state a claim, because "causation" must also be demonstrated, requiring tying the data breach event to the complained about identity theft event. &nbsp;(Kahler case
 I recall was dismissed for inability to demonstrate causation).<br>
  
 Lots of interesting challenges here, as well as opportunities to craft logical framings for valuation that can address issues above. &nbsp;All of my
 prior analysis suggests that the focus should be on value of a given data right (or set of data rights), rather than looking at the value of the data itself (lawyers might say as "data qua data"). &nbsp;In that regard, I personally conclude that data value is extrinsic
 to the data, and depends on context, use and user where it is "converted" into valuable information. &nbsp;To me, data is an artifact of interactions, and its use is primarily in its application by stakeholders to de-risk or leverage future interactions. &nbsp;The "trading"
 is nominally in the data (and the meaning), but is actually trading in "risk," and data in context permits the mitigation of threat and vulnerability associated with future interactions with people, institutuions and things. &nbsp;Data (like rocks) is also "dual
 use" so that its value (and its potential for harm) might not be calculable prior to that use (see Associated Patentees above for dynamic pricing notion) 
 
 <br>
 
 But I digress. . . .

Markus Sabadello is scribing.
Heather Vescent:  This is the 6th weeks of Identiverse, I just 
  recorded a video for that. It will go on for another 2 weeks. 
  Registration is free. There are a lot of really cool sessions.
Jeff Orgel: Amen to the Henry point of view!!
Heather Vescent:  We have a few recurring CCG meetings. This here 
  is our regular CCG call.
Heather Vescent:  We also have a VC for Education Task Force 
  call, headed by dmitriz and kimhd
Heather Vescent:  We also have DID Resolution calls on Mondays.
Dmitri Zagidulin: I think Heather means someone else - I am 
  merely attending the VC Edu calls occasionally
Heather Vescent:  And the third one is the Secure Data Storage 
  call, on Thursdays.
Dmitri Zagidulin: Yeah that's em!
Dmitri Zagidulin: Me
Heather Vescent:  Sorry dmitriz you are on the Secure Data 
  Storage call, not VC for Education Task Force.

Topic: Action Items

Heather Vescent:  Kimhd do you want to give an update on Action 
  Items?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Regarding 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143</a>, we closed that 
  on last week's call, chairs will act on it this week.
Heather Vescent: Issue 143: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/142">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/142</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thanks to Orie_ , we got some insight into 
  community group licenses.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There are two take aways: 1. We have an 
  increasing amount of work items related on sample 
  implementations. The community license doesn't really cover work 
  like this.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  This license is about specs and test suite, 
  but may not be suitable for all implementations
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Orie_ suggested Apache2, the chairs need to 
  follow up on this
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The default LICENSE.md we include in repos 
  is missing the full text of the W3C's recommend CG license
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We need to update all the existing repos 
  accordingly
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We will try to make it easier to do the 
  right thing going forward, so things are set up correctly
Orie Steele: Yes, thanks to Kim for tracking this down!
Heather Vescent:  Thanks kimhd for your diligent follow-up on the 
  licensing topic, this is hard work that gives clarity
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_vM55wQyJ5jiiD6ro3crCFIvC2TGxyZ8_B2t45RXFo/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_vM55wQyJ5jiiD6ro3crCFIvC2TGxyZ8_B2t45RXFo/edit?usp=sharing</a>
Heather Vescent:  We will start now with the "Credentials not in 
  JSON topic"

Topic: Credentials not in JSON

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I will go through my slide deck quickly, so 
  we can then get everyone to contribute their part
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Please open above link, I will walk through 
  it
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We had subject matter expects Ignacio 
  Alamillo and Anthony Camilleri who have been very active in this 
  space.
S/expects/experts/
Manu Sporny: Slide 2
Heather Vescent: Noise?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We have the VC in Educations task force. One 
  of our topics is to come up with examples that can be used in 
  pilots.
Heather Vescent: Voip noise?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There is however a lot prior work on 
  educational data standards.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  But for using these, one challenge is that 
  we need to work with XML
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The goal is to try to find possible 
  solutions
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  In contrast to other use cases, in this are 
  there is a lot of precedent of Linked Data use, e.g. for 
  competencies definitions.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  All of this work enables alignment and 
  transferability
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  One example application is Credential Finder
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There is also a lot of precedent in the 
  European Qualification Framework, there is a lot of work on 
  alignment of different levels of achievements.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There is also LER Hub, which is gathering 
  resources.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  If your degree data is outdated, it limits 
  your capabilities, so this is about empowering people.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The idea that records need to be portable is 
  becoming more important.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There is a lot of existing work in XML, what 
  do we do with it? Two examples.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Example 1: EDCI... Mapped the VC data model 
  to XML.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Currently VC has two serializations, but it 
  should be possible to support others.
Manu Sporny: Very happy that EDCI authors are on the call today 
  so we can talk about this... think there is a better solution.
Manu Sporny: (That is just a slight change from what they're 
  doing)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Why did they do it? There are eIDAS digital 
  signature requirements. There's a need to use XML.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  VC data model does not currently define an 
  XML serialization.
Manu Sporny: Noooo, XML jamming!
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Example 2: A common way to express 
  transcripts on the college and high school level. Done in XML.
Manu Sporny: I mean, XML Jamming works...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  In our VC for Education group, what guidance 
  do we give? What's okay as a short time measure?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Other options we have not seen yet are 
  mapping XML to JSON or JSON-LD. We haven't seen this yet but it 
  has been discussed. This needs discussion by the standards group.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Given there are different requirements, e.g. 
  in the case of eIDAS, this may support one solution over another.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  (Showing slide 8 now)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Say that we did support XML as a VC 
  serialization. Then what about the legal signature requirements?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I'd like to invite our legal experts to give 
  context.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  NachoAlamillo and larinyo ?
Kaliya Young: Present_
Lluís Alfons Ariño: Nacho speaking
Kaliya Young: Can you please re-share the link to she slides :)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:

Heather Vescent: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_vM55wQyJ5jiiD6ro3crCFIvC2TGxyZ8_B2t45RXFo/edit#slide=id.g8c7bea63ca_0_68">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_vM55wQyJ5jiiD6ro3crCFIvC2TGxyZ8_B2t45RXFo/edit#slide=id.g8c7bea63ca_0_68</a>
Nacho Alamillo:  In the EU we have the regulation that supports 
  the movement of legal documents between member states. There is a 
  regulation that define the syntax formats. There are 
  specifications for advanced signatures. If you use any format in 
  the E.U. decision, any member state will recognize it.
Manu Sporny: XADES -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES</a>
Nacho Alamillo:  Right now, we have 4 technical formats which are 
  recognized.
Lluís Alfons Ariño: CADES
Lluís Alfons Ariño: PADES
Manu Sporny: CADES -- 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAdES_(computing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAdES_(computing</a>)
Manu Sporny: PADES - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES</a>
Lluís Alfons Ariño: I know Nacho ;-)
Nacho Alamillo:  You have a lot of freedom to use these profiles 
  with respect to content. You don't have to go through XML 
  serialization.
Nacho Alamillo:  (Discussing features of the different formats)
Nacho Alamillo:  It doesn't preclude you from using non-XML 
  formats for the signatures.
Manu Sporny: JADES
Nacho Alamillo:  We are also working in EBSI, inside the 
  technical committee, we are working on a new technical 
  specification (JADES - JSON Advanced Electronic Signatures)
Juan Caballero: !!!
Nacho Alamillo:  This specification is still non-public, but it 
  may be possible to share it in a limited scope
Manu Sporny: JADES 
  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920548919300960">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920548919300960</a>
Nacho Alamillo:  This is eIDAS in JSON format. We extends JSON 
  Web Signatures by defining additional header parameters.
Lluís Alfons Ariño: Jades is been work in ETSI (not in EBSI)
Nacho Alamillo:  We are doing something similar for JWS as we 
  have already done with XML.
Orie Steele: You can use JWS in LD Proofs..
Nacho Alamillo:  We can align JWS with eIDAS
Orie Steele: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/lds-jws2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/lds-jws2020</a> ( this used 
  detached JWS, which does support a JWS header)
Nacho Alamillo:  You can use JADES to sign the VC, without 
  transforming it to XML.
Nacho Alamillo:  You can also use JADES with a special 
  transformation method
Nacho Alamillo:  We have to wait for JADES to get approved
Nacho Alamillo:  Hopefully we will have a first version of it 
  this year.
Lluís Alfons Ariño: EBSI eIdas Bridge
Nacho Alamillo:  In the regulation, it's also possible to support 
  different methods to validate signatures. We have explored this 
  in the EBSI project, there is work happening on an eIDAS bridge. 
  I have written about this is in my legal report.
Lluís Alfons Ariño: EIdas bridge: 
  <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about</a>
Lluís Alfons Ariño: Anthony speaking now
Lluís Alfons Ariño: EBSI: 
  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/ebsi">https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/ebsi</a>
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  There is a different between draft standards 
  and it actually being available to public administrations. You 
  would probably talk about 3-5 years of lag before this hits the 
  type of production we are talking about.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  In the meantime, in the meantime, Europe has 
  built its educational infrastructure on XML, e.g. for exchanging 
  student data in XML.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  I've been heading one of those, trying to 
  express VCs and XML
Lluís Alfons Ariño: 4 Signature formats: Digital signature : 
  XAdES, CAdES, PAdES and ASiC-S/ASiC-E
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  The reason I'm giving this information, this 
  is all standardization work. We are aiming for two things. We 
  hope to have an XML recommendation from VC Task Force that would 
  allow us to say that we can be in line using XML, but probably 
  will want to change to JSON over time.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  We are talking about issuing credentials in 
  the millions.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  We woud like an XML namespace dedicated to 
  VCs.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  Second, it would be very very nice to be 
  able to have a schema definition file that says this is a 
  recommended implementation of VCs in XML.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  I'm not technical enough to talk about XML 
  vs. RDF/XML, but a high level message is that it will be 
  preferable to have a schema definition recommended by the CG.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Back to you heathervescent for queue 
  management
Orie Steele:  This is really exciting work, I have done some 
  experiments converting JSON-LD VCs to XML and back. Depending on 
  your tolerance, there are mechanisms for converting. There are 
  similar mechanisms for binary representations.
Orie Steele:  We can rely on JSON-LD vocabularies, and then 
  convert to other serializations. The advantage is that you don't 
  have to repeat vocabularies in each seralization, but only have 
  to do it once.
@Orie we are seeing similar things dealing with conversions 
  between xml and jsonld in particular for supply chain and retail 
  legacy formats
Manu Sporny:  First, thank you William NachoAlamillo larinyo for 
  being here, this is very important and this group cares deeply. 
  Second, this is the right place, there is a lot of experience in 
  this group, please continue to engage with it.
Manu Sporny:  Also, work that happens here (e.g. XML 
  serialization of VCs) can then go into the VC Maintenance WG.
Manu Sporny:  Regarding what to specifically work on, I heard 
  each of you mention two primary thigns.
Manu Sporny:  One is a requirement for a clean XML 
  representation. The second has to do with digital signature 
  formats that you just outlined.
Manu Sporny:  Ideally we would provide a profile that matches 
  well with XML. One failure scenario would be to try to support 
  absolutely everything.
Manu Sporny:  There would be too many options, we should reduce 
  optionality.
Manu Sporny:  The other important thing, as Orie_ mentioned, a 
  few of us have been working on converting VCs into other formats, 
  e.g. CBOR or XML.
Nacho Alamillo: Agree. In fact, the idea of having advanced 
  electronic signature "baseline" profiles is to reduce complexity, 
  yes
Manu Sporny:  There are some common design patterns we can use 
  for full round-tripping.
Manu Sporny:  What we would need to know is feedback on the XML 
  format, what should it look like. And we need to understand the 
  exact requirements for the digital signatures.
Lluís Alfons Ariño: Europass EDCI Data model 0.9.0 
  <a href="https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model/tree/release/0.9.0">https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model/tree/release/0.9.0</a>
Manu Sporny: Yes, let's keep it simple!
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I don't have anything, I was just wanting to 
  queue up Nacho and Anthony before they have to drop :)
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  If there is openness to support XML, it may 
  actually be quite simple.
Manu Sporny: For example: Go to XML, use XADES.
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  We have a lot of documentation on all of 
  this
Nacho Alamillo:  We should go for JADES for the baseline 
  standard.
Nacho Alamillo:  We don't believe in issuing VCs in PDF (using 
  PADES)
Xml .... lots of possibilities...
Manu Sporny:  Thanks a lot to kimhd for putting the slide deck 
  together
Heather Vescent: +1 Thank you Kimhd!
Juan Caballero: Baseline profiles here: 
  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignature+standards?reload=true">https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignature+standards?reload=true</a>
Manu Sporny:  If we can take PADES off the table, that's good 
  since it's one option less we need to consider.
Manu Sporny:  Did you say XADES or JADES are already a standard? 
  If we can focus on of those, it should be achievable.
Manu Sporny:  Potentially we could even get it on standard track.
Juan Caballero: XADES = standard, JADES = coming soon
Nacho Alamillo: Yes, today's solution should be based in XAdES
Juan Caballero: If i understood currently
Lluís Alfons Ariño: Right, today: XML+Xades
Manu Sporny:  I'm hearing a strong requirement to encode in XML. 
  If that's a hard requiement, then maybe what we should do is an 
  XML serialization. I'm not sure if this is the preference
Juan Caballero: (Also Manu's explicit pronunciation of X-ADES is 
  helpful :D )
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  This was my preference
Nacho Alamillo:  Mine too
Anil John:  I want to get a sense from you kimhd if there are any 
  current examples of education credentials, e.g. a university 
  degree.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit</a>
Anil John:  We are about to come out with a prize competition for 
  a digital wallet UI, I've been talking to U.S. Department of 
  Education.
Anil John:  I'm a student looking for an employer. The employer 
  needs both a Permanent Resident Card, and a University degree.
Anil John:  We have already worked on the Permanent Resident 
  Card, but I'm looking for an example of a university degree.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Unfortunately no good examples exist yet, 
  but see this document above.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  People from the relevant bodies are very 
  supportive and are helping us going through the data modeling 
  process. The understanding has to be that anything in here is a 
  draft.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The other goal is allow pilots to be 
  unblocked and get started.
Heather Vescent:  Also thank you from my part to everyone who 
  spoke and contributed today.

Topic: Updates on Secure Data Storage on DIDComm

Sam Curren: Yes
Orie Steele:  The SDS Working Group is a joint effort between W3C 
  and DIF. The purpose is to support the concept of data storage 
  that's associated with DIDs.
Orie Steele:  The use cases are things like storing wallet 
  contents, storing things associated with a DID, sharing access 
  between DIDs.
Orie Steele:  It's a generic data structure, not limited to DIDs.
Orie Steele:  The work is ongoing, there have been two primary 
  input documents. 1. Encrypted Data Vault spec at W3C CCG, 2. 
  Identity Hub spec developed at DIF.
Orie Steele:  Those are similar in some ways, different in other 
  ways. The SDS Working Group is still working through the 
  differences, the interfaces, etc.
Orie Steele:  EDVs are for storing encrypted data. Identity Hubs 
  have a lot of public data use cases.
Orie Steele:  We will eventually see deeper integration between 
  those interfaces and other standards happening out there.
Sam Curren: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YiL-A9YaNgQpFBraJJOLLUPyFfZ6uQ1uqtTCiDZxNqI/edit#slide=id.p">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YiL-A9YaNgQpFBraJJOLLUPyFfZ6uQ1uqtTCiDZxNqI/edit#slide=id.p</a>
Sam Curren:  See this link for a quick overview of the DIDComm 
  Working Group
Sam Curren:  Provide secure communication with trust rooted in 
  DIDs. This originated in Hyperledger Aries.
Sam Curren:  We've made good progress. See slide 4 for a layer 
  map.
Sam Curren:  Related work includes JWM, ECDH-1PU
Sam Curren:  It's transport-agnostic, can work via HTTP, 
  WebSocket, QR Code.
Sam Curren:  Last slide, join us on our calls, we have 
  recordings.
Heather Vescent:  Thanks all for the call, next week we will have 
  a presentation by GS1.

<p>Mountain View, Calif., July 22, 2020 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> has made the decision to transition Authenticate, the FIDO Alliance’s industry conference dedicated to the who, what, why, and how of modern user authentication, from an in-person event to a virtual-only conference. It will be held this November, as originally scheduled. The Alliance will create a digital conference experience that will inspire attendees to embrace a new way to authenticate and present the necessary tools to move past passwords.</p>



<p>“While it’s disappointing we cannot be together for the very first Authenticate, the safety of our community is our biggest priority,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Due to continuing concerns over COVID-19, and in alignment with the information we’re hearing from local officials, we decided to transition to a digital-only format, and focus on giving attendees a powerful and informative virtual experience.”</p>



<p>As FIDO recasts the conference to a virtual-only format, it will expand it to a multi-day November event spread across all time zones to accommodate global participation, including live Q&amp;A sessions with presenters. The virtual format allows for sponsoring companies to showcase their solutions through virtual exhibit booths and other branding and networking opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2020 headlining keynote speakers are as formerly announced: Dr. Whitfield Diffie, the co-inventor of public key cryptography; Joy Chik, corporate vice president of identity at Microsoft; Mark Risher, senior director of product management at Google; and Stina Ehrensvard, CEO and founder of Yubico. A full list of speakers is available on the <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/speakers/">Authenticate website</a>.</p>



<p>The conference agenda will contain informative content on authentication, with a focus on the FIDO approach, including these topics:&nbsp;</p>



  Case studies from service and technology providers including CVS Health, EMILY’s List, Facebook, Google, IBM, Mass Mutual, Microsoft, MITRE Corporation, NTT DOCOMO, PNC Bank, and Target  Sessions on the state of authentication, building an authentication strategy, and how FIDO fits with initiatives like W3C Web Payments, and EMVCo 3DS and SRC  Standards and technical implementation presentations focusing on FIDO for identity verification; bringing FIDO Authentication to IoT; OpenID for open banking; standards and the future of payments; FIDO certification; attestation and more  Policy discussions around PSD2, GDPR and eIDAS; authentication to enable better privacy for citizens; authentication from a regulator’s perspective and more  



<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">www.authenticatecon.com</a> for the latest information. A refreshed agenda and registration details will be available soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviews Helen Chua, Senior Sales Director with NEC APAC.&nbsp;</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Helen Chua
<p>I am passionate about the use of biometrics to correctly identify and verify a person especially in the area of digital identity. My interest in biometrics dates back 25 years ago,&nbsp; and has propelled me to be involved in many security-related projects involving governments and nation-wide deployments across multiple countries, particularly at the 9/11 tragedy which saw sudden huge demand and opportunities that humbled me.&nbsp; It gives me great satisfaction to see how biometrics can improve security by identifying individuals accurately and enhance the verification of a person’s physical identity, whether it is in passport issuance, in national identity systems (physical and digital), border control, law enforcement, or finance. Orchestrating a brighter world using biometrics is why I do what I do.</p>
<p>One of the things I enjoy is thinking of creative ideas and solutions that helps to solve a client’s problem. In 1995, automated border control gates were unheard of and, together with Singapore immigration, we introduced the first automated gates using biometrics to reduce manpower while improving accuracy, consistency and speed. I have also helped to pioneer the seamless onboarding process for various financial institutions using biometrics. These represent just a few of the many firsts that I have been involved in.</p>
<p>Being trained in fingerprint, facial and iris technologies with NEC, I am delighted to be part of a company who are ranked number 1 globally by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology for its speed and accuracy in biometrics technologies.&nbsp; NEC technologies, especially facial matching, are developed to be able to identify a person regardless of gender or ethnic group, which ties in to my firm belief that all people are created equal and should have equal opportunities to reach their full potential.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Growing up, my parents were my role models. Each day their lives exemplified their teaching. They told us that the sky is our limit and they installed values of honesty and integrity in us. Dad is a firm believer that every family is a building block of society. Who we are and what we stand for will either give and add to society or otherwise. I am indebted to the mentors whom I can turn to any time, they helped me see my blind spots and oversights. I am very blessed to have forged many friendships internationally and surrounded by so many who have encouraged, inspired, and spurred me on. I am most grateful for my loving family and the friends in my path. These are the people who accept me for who I am and bring out the best in me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Life’s goals should not be focused on achievements, relationships are just as important, if not more! I learnt much early on in life never to achieve at the expense of others. This has a lot to do with one’s perspective! How to always see the good in others and how together we can do a whole lot more to the betterment of our company and ultimately benefiting our society. Though I must add sometimes&nbsp; I do find myself in sticky situations and how many times I have had to dig deep into myself, bounce off my confidantes, including my supportive husband, and navigate out of them without hurting anyone nor myself. There are a couple of times I have failed regretfully, yet those are the times that have seen the greatest growth in me as a person.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Start recognising that all people are created equal and to involve a diversity of minds to create the best products and solutions. The biometric technology that I am involved in, we use diverse groups of people to train the engine such that it’s not biased towards a certain color or people group.&nbsp; CEOs should deliberately put in place measures to support every vulnerable group to create a workplace environment where all individuals can fully express themselves without fear of discrimination.&nbsp; Individuality and uniqueness of diverse employees are important as well as a corporate culture where everyone can work and participate to their full potential.</p>
<p>Stop thinking that, by having the best team to create identity products and solutions which recognizes the “elite group” or the “best breed”, they will they find the most profit from it. In fact, they will find the most revenue by having a identity solution which has an inclusive mindset and a diverse group of people creating together. With the diversity, the solution can reach more and expand to more use cases.&nbsp; They should continue hearing the voices of diverse groups for their research and development and not have an echo chamber of researchers that think the same way so as to produce creative and innovative products.</p>
<p>Continue to reach out to a diverse community of partners to forge strong alliances as no company can work on its own.&nbsp; The community needs each other to sustain its business and to expand and diversify into different areas.&nbsp; Business is about networking and reaching out for more, more clients, more use cases, more collaborations, more allies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not have an echo chamber of researchers that think the same way so as to produce creative and innovative products</p></blockquote>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the beauty and uniqueness that every individual brings about his/her beauty and strength and together as a group, Diversity is power, and more.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Hacksaw Ridge is the movie. “Lord, help me get one more” Desmond continued to save one life at a time.&nbsp; One day at a time, one task at a time, one person at a time. It is believing what the Lord will help us achieve our goal one step at a time.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>There is no short cut in life. Every person who is at the top has had to spill their own blood, sweat and tears to get there.&nbsp; Failure is the mother of success! Never let failure drive you to the ground. Instead, get up and grow from these life lessons. When you overcome, you will be bigger and stronger.</p>

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviews Melissa Carvalho, Vice President of Enterprise and Customer Identity and Access Management for Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Melissa Carvalho
<p>I am the Vice President of Enterprise and Customer Identity and Access Management for Royal Bank of Canada. RBC is ranked as one of the top 25 banks globally and has over 80K employees and ~16 million customers. I am proud to manage the best Identity and Access Management team in the world! My 200+ member team is comprised of some of the most diverse and talented people I have met.&nbsp; While challenges come our way, I’ve discovered that there is no challenge that this team cannot overcome. It is refreshing to work with individuals who are always looking to over deliver and to offer the best solutions to our customers. More importantly, they have taught me their interests go far beyond their role, with their involvement in community events and non-profit organizations. Their example and their spirit is what motivates me daily. They renew my belief that one person really can make a difference and demonstrate how powerful we are when we team together!</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I got to where I am today by setting my goals high, making a plan, and – most importantly – being flexible to take on any challenge that life presents me.&nbsp; My career has been marked with a series of opportunities.&nbsp; In my last year of university while studying to be a teacher, a tech company offered me a role that started after my graduation. While at the time my desire was to go into teaching, the opportunity was one that I decided to try as I could always go back to teaching. Within four months, I went on my first IAM course and then started traveling across North America to deploy solutions. The rest was history. Each meeting and relationship created more opportunities and opened more doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way?&nbsp; 
<p>The most important lesson I’ve learned is that life is short.&nbsp; It was fairly early in my career when I lost my best friend, my mother. In the months and years after her passing it was as if I was watching my life as though it was a series of short films. Going through that loss taught me to look at my interactions differently, more importantly to speak up for injustices and inequalities I was seeing. I’ve noticed that people rarely remember what I’ve said but rather what I’ve done or not done.&nbsp; I didn’t want to be a passenger in this journey but rather the driver of my destiny. I’m a firm believer that every individual matters and together we can make a difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every individual matters and together we can make a difference</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>START: Working with our clients to develop use cases and solutions that meet real-life needs. If we walk hand-in-hand to develop ‘journeys’, the solutions will be more valuable and we’ll create lasting partnerships.</p>
<p>STOP: Creating and deploying solutions and expecting the clients to want them.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: To advocate and ensure the solutions we create offer diversity.&nbsp; Continue to ensure we break down biases.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you?&nbsp; 
<p>I would like to experience in my lifetime what it feels like to live equally without judgement — seems like a lofty goal but I believe it’s possible.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t read or watch many films — my recommendation to fellow members is to volunteer by putting themselves out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; Working with others in a different situation from your own helps change your perspective on life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’?&nbsp; 
<p>Take chances, stop worrying about the small things.&nbsp; If something you’re worrying about now won’t matter in 5 years, don’t give it more than 5 minutes of thought. Life is very short and can change in an instant.</p>

<p>Setting a tone for inclusive collaboration</p><p>An important part of supporting a community where people are coming from all over the world and from a variety of backgrounds is putting in place a code of conduct that provides a baseline understanding about what is ok and what is not. The purpose of DIF’s Code of Conduct is to create an open, healthy and productive culture where members and the community can build and grow together.</p><p>During the DIF Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting in June of 2020, this Code of Conduct was reviewed:</p><p>In lieu of an executive summary, we would here like to offer a few highlights:</p> 1.) Community Advocates <p>One of the innovations in the code of conduct is the creation of a role we call community advocates. Each of these is a community member who takes seriously their power and responsibility as facilitator. We are working to provide formal training to support these advocates and give them a firm foundation on what to listen for and how to speak to conflicts. If you are part of the community and would like to volunteer as a community advocate, please let us&nbsp;know.</p><p>In particular, these advocates can diffuse, mitigate, and failing both, escalate conflicts. See in particular the expanded dispute escalation section of the&nbsp;code:</p><blockquote>Dispute Escalation and Incident Resolution Mechanisms</blockquote><blockquote>We are all here to contribute value and reap the benefits of community collaboration. While it is natural to have disagreements and find situations uncomfortable, DIF believes that resolving any issues should take place within the community via open communication.</blockquote><blockquote>DIF has within it a group of members who have some training and skills in supporting healthy conflict resolution that can be volunteer community advocates.</blockquote><blockquote>If something does happen, open communication and shared, cross community healing is a must. The community should get better as a&nbsp;whole.</blockquote> 2.) Diversity front-of-mind <p>Informed by a substantial corpus of experiences throughout the broader identity technology community where perspectives from marginalized groups were actively or unwittingly excluded, we felt our code of conduct needed to be explicit about the most nefarious and effective tool of silencing: scope management. To this end, we put into our code of conduct the following definitive statement:</p><blockquote>Diversity is never definitively out-of-scope or foreclosed as irrelevant to more urgent business.</blockquote> 3.) Proactive inclusivity <p>Here are some more important excerpts from the code of conduct that cover our statement on inclusivity and diversity</p><blockquote>Inclusive: We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable, threatened, or unheard/dismissed (explicitly or implicitly) is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community, contributing to an atmosphere of inclusion. DIF takes seriously the maintenance of substantive inclusion in which any member feels empowered to contribute; if any do not feel the group’s chairs are doing enough to create this atmosphere, they may go elsewhere in DIF for help achieving this&nbsp;change.</blockquote><blockquote>Diverse: DIF welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone fairly. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, dis/ability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability. Diversity of perspective, identity and experience should be considered a positive contribution. Diversity and empathetic, pro-actively inclusive ways of stewarding cooperation is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time gesture; DIF’s Steering Committee and Working Group Chairs and Editors concretely support ongoing training or cooperative learning between leaders of working groups, mailing lists, and other&nbsp;venues.</blockquote> A living, open-source document <p>You can read the full code of conduct <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/blob/master/assets/code-of-conduct--ratified-document-june20-2020.pdf">here</a>, or if you would like to suggest edits or open issues, you can do so on github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">here</a>. As Balázs mentions in the video, the code of conduct is licensed for being “forked” and adapted anywhere it can be helpful, and we look forward to contribution and discussion as it continues to&nbsp;evolve.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/difs-updated-code-of-conduct-a0c2d9dce1ad">DIF’s Updated Code of Conduct</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         <a>Hi Nader, thanks for sharing to the list and for your well-written summary. I think it's important to engage governments to help them understand how technology based on our standards can help protect their citizens and to ensure that recommendations/regulatory requirements make room for or even encourage the adoption of global standards that are inclusively designed. When we don't do this, we run into difficult situations: for example, that the secp256k1 curve is not a NIST curve has caused a divide between enterprise and government usage of smart contract infrastructure. We have a chance to bridge chasms now.

I'd be interested in collaborating with you to create a Work Item within CCG to synthesize the relevant parts of the guidelines, organize a community response, and coordinate guidance from those who have experience with providing impactful feedback to NIST over the next 19 days. If you're open in this approach, I would recommend proposing a new work item using this link:

</a><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/new/choose</a>

I am happy to then accept responsibility as a co-owner of this Proposed Work Item, which would help turn this into an official Work Item since we will have two different parties. You can read about the full process here:

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit</a>#

We can have more than two owners on a Work Item, in case anyone else on this list is interested. Also Nader, please feel no obligation to take this on as your Work Item should your schedule or other commitments disallow. If no action in two days, I will make a new Proposed Work Item issue and bump this thread due to the short timeline, and invite participation to the GitHub issue.

Best,
- Wayne

<p>Today, secure access to online applications and services has evolved into a framework reliant on devices, public key cryptography and biometrics to replace the shared secrets of aging passwords. Since 2013, the FIDO Alliance has developed open and scalable advancements to eliminate phishing and other security attacks. To introduce these improvements and to educate employees throughout corporate management and IT security, FIDO Alliance has developed a series of best practices and how-to white papers that match the Alliance’s goals with the responsibilities and titles of technology professionals. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging on within all companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This white paper answers the most common questions from CXOs about the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. The goal of this document is to guide executive leaders within an organization as to why they should invest in FIDO2 deployment for their employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The public sector is taking on unique challenges; from mitigating the spread of COVID-19 to the implementation of privacy laws, like CCPA, there’s a lot at play as we look at the new or evolving ways our identities are being and can be leveraged. Our Summer Government Digital Forum sparked eye-opening discussions on contact tracing, citizen data, privacy law, public-private partnerships, and more, exploring the ways digital identity is becoming increasingly central – if not already – within each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With so many points to cover within each of these dynamic discussion topics, it’s no surprise that there was much more to unpack after each virtual session came to a close. Following the event, we chatted (virtually, of course) with our speakers from Socure, to dive a bit deeper and answer further questions from their panel,&nbsp;<a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/stopping-fraud-at-front-door-2/">Stopping Fraud at the Front Door: Protecting Prosperity and Privacy with Better Digital Solutions.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>One World Identity (OWI): You mentioned individual countries who are doing a good job managing citizens’ data and digital identity information, but as the world becomes more globally interconnected, are there any early winners across multiple nations?</p>



<p>Socure: Estonia is a pioneer in going digital, considered by some to be the most advanced digital society globally. 99% of its public services are online, and 98% of tax filings are filed electronically. There is a nationwide health system that pulls from all healthcare providers to create a common record for each patient, accessible online. The ID can be used to access e-banking, e-voting, e-health, and even electronic residency systems. Underpinning these systems is a mandatory national ID card system that can be used via a mobile phone SIM card or a biometric-enabled smartphone app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OWI: Is the SSA database mentioned during this session consent-based? If so, it would seem not to work to catch fake/synthetic identities as the fraudster would not provide consent – is that a correct view?</p>



<p>Socure: As made clear by the name of the program (Electronic Consent-Based SSN Verification), it is a consent-based service. The service can only be used if the number holder provides a wet or electronic signature consenting to the disclosure of their SSN verification. However, we would note that fraudsters don’t have an ethical issue with submitting fraudulent consents. This service should be used in the context of a holistic identity verification solution to weed out as much risk and fraud as possible.</p>



<p>One World Identity (OWI): Where can you find more info on the SSA API?</p>



<p>Socure:&nbsp;Here is the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) program website:<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/dataexchange/eCBSV/index.html">&nbsp;Electronic Consent-based SSN Verification (eCBSV)</a>. In 2018, Senate Bill 2155 passed sweeping regulatory changes. Section 215 directed the SSA to modify its databases or systems to allow financial institutions to electronically verify if a name, DOB, and SSN match SSA records in real-time. eCBSV returns a match verification of “Yes” or “No.” If records show that the SSN holder is deceased, eCBSV returns a death indicator. Note that eCBSV does not verify an individual’s identity. In June 2020, the SSA started allowing select entities to access the service. Socure is intelligently nesting the eCBSV results within our models to provide additional intelligence and enhanced identity verification and risk scores.</p>



<p>OWI: What are the most important considerations in choosing an ID verification and fraud vendor?</p>



<p>Socure: First, it’s critical to understand your use case. Is the goal to minimize fraud, minimize false positives, increase auto acceptances, reduce onboarding friction, or satisfy compliance requirements? Accuracy is a crucial consideration but, more specifically, the accuracy of what? For example, if fraud is your most significant concern, then look for the best fraud capture rates. Accuracy is ultimately driven by rich, dynamic data sources and the application of machine learning to the data. Look for strength in data science and innovation in a vendor, as you will always need to keep up with developments in fraud techniques, data breaches, and evolving digital opportunities.</p>



<p>Flexibility is important so that you choose step-up options, adjust policies or design logic for various products or services, and otherwise tailor the IDV solution to the risk profiles of your organization and user base. You want to be able to distinguish the riskier applicants and address the risks as needed, to determine if they are “good” individuals.</p>



<p>Speed (i.e., latency) is crucial for digital-first entities, as well as technical feasibility. Many solutions are API-based, providing code that you can readily integrate into your systems. Customer support is also important. Look for 24-7 tech support, reporting tools, and solutions consulting.</p>



<p>OWI: Can you explain how the fraudulent unemployment office filings that we saw in the news might have been preventable?</p>



<p>Socure: Each filing for unemployment should be subjected to identity verification (IDV) to determine if they are who they say they are. Then and only then should the process move onto authentication for access to existing accounts. Fraudsters lean on stolen and synthetic identities to claim benefits. Still, an IDV check will catch inconsistent or untrustworthy data points, such as names and addresses that are not correlated, burner email accounts, email domains used primarily by hackers, and other suspicious factors.</p>



<p>Fraud could also have been prevented if state unemployment agencies shared information on fraud attempts and fraudulent profiles. We’ve seen this work in the private sector, where Socure’s consortium of customers share their outcomes with us so that we can update our analytics models to stay abreast of the latest fraudulent profiles.</p>



<p>Next, we chatted with&nbsp;Taylor Liggett,&nbsp;General Manager of Sterling Identity, and&nbsp;Brian Williams,&nbsp;General Manager, Government at Sterling, who spoke on<a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/evolution-background-screening-identity-services/">&nbsp;The Evolution of Background Screening &amp; Identity Services: How Government Can Deploy New Capabilities to Support Their Mission</a>, to dive a bit deeper into the topics discussed and answer some of the outstanding questions from our audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One World Identity (OWI):&nbsp;Where can companies help fill these gaps in expertise/human capital we see in the government workforce in the immediate? And in the long-term, what should younger generations be doing to help mitigate this risk?</p>



<p>Sterling: We discussed an existential issue that exists for the future of the government workforce. Barring a significant reworking of the hiring, compensation, career, and culture of that workforce, a long-term, sustainable solution probably rests between existing process improvements and new modernized pilot programs for onboarding and retaining talent. A gig-based model for in-demand capabilities and a pre-screened inventory of specialists willing to engage in limited scopes of work may be a viable solution to bolster the government workforce.</p>



<p>Younger generations may naturally be more inclined to embrace flexible employment models, both as employers and workers.</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;Do you see a world where organizations share these “portable Identities” with one another?</p>



<p>Sterling:&nbsp;We can imagine a future where attributes of portable identities are shared between organizations. This comes with the critical caveat that the individual must remain aware and in control of their data and the circumstances under which it is shared.</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;What industry is leading the way around portable identity</p>



<p>Sterling:&nbsp;Social media companies, through services such as single sign on to apps and websites, primed the pump for portable identity. Marketplace and Gig Economy companies took this a step further and embraced modern identity verification solutions. Today several technology companies and the screening industry are working to bring the next iteration of portable identity to market.</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;Is there an app available now from Sterling with identity and document verification built-in? If so, what documents can be verified, and how? Is there a mobile biometric collection connected to other corroborating information available for your clients?</p>



<p>Sterling:&nbsp;Yes, you can try the Sterling Identity Verification demo&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.sterlingidentity.com.">here</a>. Note that this demo does not transmit or store any of your personal information; it is intended to demonstrate the fast and easy the verification process is, using just a smartphone. Typical government-issued documents that can be used for verification include driver’s licenses, passports, state-issued identity cards, and others depending on location.</p>



<p>In addition to capturing facial photos via the identity verification process, Sterling Identity can collect fingerprints, facial images, and signatures at our nationwide network of collection centers.</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;Identity seems to be more and more foundational as we talk about “remotely” available services, both to constituents and corporations. How likely is it to have a national ID database as a public-private coordinated effort?</p>



<p>Sterling: The evolution of identity is becoming a great example of public-private partnership potential. Some countries already have or are headed in the direction of a national database. In the United States, there will likely be close coordination between multiple databases that exist for different reasons, to serve diverse populations.</p>



<p>The government provides various public goods that will help bring about the catalyst for this change. Public safety and the ability to deploy a portable ID for mass transit; the resolution, receipt, or remuneration of various tax and governmental fees; or the need to receive and maintain any number of government-issued/or certified credentials and licenses, will all bring about pressure for portable identity.</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;What identity verification tools or companies is Sterling considering using to meet this increased demand?</p>



<p>Sterling:&nbsp;To give our customers maximum flexibility and service reliability, we develop our own technology and partner with multiple identity vendors. These tools allow us to configure custom solutions that best meet customer needs regardless of geographic location or specific solutions requirements.</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;How can companies successfully build relationships with the government directly?</p>



<p>Sterling:&nbsp;Attending meaningful thought leadership forums, like the Know Identity Digital Forum on Government, is a great starting point. Additionally, ensuring that you are well-represented through any opportunities for public comment related to identity. Participate in thought leadership forums such as the American Council on Technology – Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) and stay engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OWI:&nbsp;Is the Indian ADAAR ID something for the USA?</p>



<p>Sterling:&nbsp;The underlying premise of delivering a unique, verified identifier to each citizen for use in digital transactions is certainly not new, but India is ahead of much of the world in bringing this to life. Digital identity initiatives being explored in the United States will likely have attributes of the AADHAAR scheme in terms of verified, unique identities. Still, we envision a much more granular approach when it comes to giving individuals the ability to not only control a verified identity, but to control discrete immutable aspects of their identity, like a verified education history, professional certification, birthdate, or otherwise. This emerging field is fascinating, complex, and promises to be enormously valuable to individuals, government, and businesses to the extent that identity solutions can help make the economy more frictionless and secure at the same time.</p>



<p>As always, there’s much more to tackle in the public sector. And now, we’re&nbsp;looking forward to benchmarking the industry shifts that will take place between now and our upcoming Fall Government Digital Forum! And if this is all news to you, take a moment to&nbsp;<a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/view-sessions/">catch up on the other sessions</a>&nbsp;from this event you may have missed.</p>

<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish an Assessment and Infrastructure (Technology &amp; Operations) industry standards as components of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf"> Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.<br></p>



<p>Document Status: These review documents have been approved as Draft Recommendations V1.0 by the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) that operates under the DIACC controlling policies.</p>



<p>Summary:&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The intent of the PCTF Assessment component is to establish the certification scheme to verify that a process, service, or product conforms with criteria defined in the PCTF.<br></p>



<p>The intent of the PCTF Infrastructure (Technology &amp; Operations) component is to identify the operational policies, plans, technology and technology operations requirements to support implementation of the principles of the PCTF Profiles in the context of a Digital Identity Ecosystem.<br></p>

<p>When reviewing this draft, consider the following and note that responses to these questions are non-binding and serve to improve the PCTF.</p>



  Is the description of roles and responsibilities clear at this level?  This draft describes a tiered assessment process with varying levels of evidence examination applied depending on risk and usage profile of the service being examined for certification  Are the two processes defined enough? If not, what would be the nature of any additional discrete process? What would it apply to? Would its addition change the nature of either of the two processes defined?  If the two process versions defined are sufficient, do the differences between them meet the goals of application of a less onerous certification process to some applications for certification? If not, then what would you suggest as an alternative?  Keeping in mind the noting of potential adjustment based on the output of the TFEC Working group on LoA, are the criteria for determining which certification process applies acceptable in principle?  A draft definition of classification based on service usage is included. Does this meet the needs of this Profile at this level? If not, what alternative would you suggest?    Are there concepts or terminology that remain unclear or inconsistently applied?  This Overview is meant to define the high level model and process for certification. Development of the significant Programme execution supporting information has been deferred until the model at this level is ratified. Are there any significant omissions from this high level Overview that would preclude you from understanding the model at this level?  Do you agree with the process for certification of Services as described? If not, what specific modifications would you suggest?  Do you agree with the process for certification of Accredited Assessors as described? If not, what specific modifications would you suggest?  The last section of the document identifies a number of required documents to support this certification process. The intent is to capture detailed process-oriented content in these documents after the Certification Assessment Program has been approved in principle. With this in mind, and considering the level of detail appropriate for this document, are there any major elements of the certification program not yet addressed in this draft?  



<p>NOTE that elements of examination for certification may be adjusted based on the finalization of the Working group on LoA, please keep this in mind when commenting on this document.</p>

<p>When reviewing this draft, consider the following and note that responses to these questions are non-binding and serve to improve the PCTF.</p>



  Several feedback items suggest that additional prescriptive detail be added to this Conformance Profile. Some adjustments were made but additional input is sought to identify areas where further detail should be included. Where specific methods or standards are to be expanded upon, please include suggested methods, tools, or plan/policy items that you feel should be added.&nbsp;  The Conformance Criteria are organized into three categories. Are these appropriate and understandable? If not, please suggest an alternate categorization scheme.  Care was taken to try to strike a balance between generic Criteria defined at a high level and being too prescriptive. Do the criteria meet this objective of being prescriptive enough to be useful and generic enough to be applicable to most Digital Identity Ecosystem instances?  Note that there are several instances where cross references to related information in other Profiles. Are there other instances where this would be appropriate?  Are there significant requirements missing from this draft? If so, please identify the requirements you believe should be included.  Care was taken not to identify a specific technology or technology protocol, believing that none applied as a requirement in every instance. Is this correct, or is there a specific technology or protocol that should be included as a PCTF requirement?  



<p>NOTE that the PCTF Working Group on LoA is underway with the objective of defining how LoA will be treated across all PCTF Profiles. Treatment of potential variances in Conformance Criteria based on Service LoA were deferred in this version of the Profile. Please reserve your comments in this area to an enhanced draft of these documents when the LoA Working Group has published their results.<br></p>

<p>Value to Canadians: The PCTF Assessment and Infrastructure (Technology &amp; Operations) components will provide value to all Canadians, businesses, and governments by setting a baseline of auditable criteria to assess business, legal, and technical interoperability. The DIACC’s mandate is to collaboratively develop and deliver resources to help Canadian’s to digitally transact with security, privacy, and convenience. The PCTF is one such resource that represents a collection of industry standards, best practices, and other resources that help to establish interoperability of an ecosystem of identity services and solutions. The DIACC is a not-for-profit coalition of members from the public and private sector who are making a significant and sustained investment in accelerating<a href="https://diacc.ca/2019/02/26/canadas-digital-identity-ecosystem/"> Canada’s Identity Ecosystem</a>.</p>



<p>Context: The purpose of this Draft Recommendation review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our<a href="https://diacc.ca/principles/"> Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve these Draft Recommendations based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next drafts and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled. &nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The Hyperledger Fabric community is very excited about the release of Fabric v2.2 LTS.&nbsp;Fabric v2.2 represents the first LTS release in Fabric v2.x.&nbsp; Further enhancing the new features that make developing and deploying Hyperledger Fabric networks easier than ever before, we have added updated tutorials on the “how to” that allow developers to take full advantage of these features with tutorials supporting multiple languages so as Go, JavaScript, and TypeScript with support for Java coming soon. There are many exciting new features to be aware of, so let’s dive right into the highlights:</p>



  Decentralized governance for smart contracts: This is actually a huge change from earlier 1.x versions of Fabric where one company had the ability to influence chaincode parameters and endorsement policies for the entire consortium on a channel. In Fabric v2.2, multiple organizations must agree to the chaincode parameters and there is a much more deliberate process to upgrade chaincode that now requires a sufficient number of organizations within a consortium to agree ahead of time before the chaincode can become active on the channel.  



  New chaincode lifecycle: This feature has to be one of my favorites because packaging, installing, approving, and committing the chaincode on a channel is much easier and can even be used in a “chaincode-as-an-external-service” model.&nbsp;Chaincode is now packaged in easily readable tar files that make it much easier to inspect and coordinate the installation across multiple organizations in a consortium.  



  New chaincode application patterns: This includes the ability to add automated checks for chaincode validation prior to endorsing a transaction proposal and the ability to decentralize agreement across multiple transactions that relate to specific terms and conditions in a business case.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Private data enhancements: This enables the sharing and verification of private data without actually exposing data to those who are not supposed to see it by allowing them to compare on-chain hashes of the data to ensure they match.&nbsp;The many other features that these private data enhancements enable are too numerous to cover in this blog, so be sure to check out the “What’s new in Hyperledger Fabric v2.2” linked below.  



  External chaincode launcher: This is a seriously cool feature that I am pretty excited about and one that most developers would probably say is long overdue. Now there’s no requirement that a peer node have access to a Docker daemon in order to build and launch chaincode.&nbsp;What a game-changer! Chaincode is no longer required to be run in containers, leaving the developer with more flexibility than ever before!  



<p>Other noteworthy things to consider for Fabric v2.2 LTS:</p>



  Build Your First Network (BYFN) has been deprecated as of this v2.2 and is replaced by the Fabric Test Network.&nbsp; You can find the updated tutorial <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/test_network.html">here</a>.  The updated tutorials will all use new fabric samples based on Asset Transfer chaincodes and applications and the Fabcar chaincode will get retired.  The new Fabric Test Network allows you to start the network in a much more flexible manner and can be chaincode agnostic if you want it to be.  



<p>These are just a few of the highlights, so I highly recommend that you visit the <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/whatsnew.html">Hyperledger Fabric docs</a> to read in full detail all the exciting new features and the possibilities they open up.</p>



<p>You do not need to be an expert to be an effective contributor to the Hyperledger project. In fact, I think you will be amazed at the welcoming nature of the community and how quickly you can build on your skills simply by engaging as a contributor.</p>

&gt; Splitting off into a new thread to focus the discussion on the interplay
&gt; of these specs.
&gt;
&gt; I think this is a good point. One big challenge around asking for claims
&gt; is that we have several layers crossing wires in ad-hoc ways across these
&gt; different specs. For example, we might try to separate these layers of
&gt; asking for claims in ascending order from machine-only to human-readable:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Pipe: TLS, CHAPI, DIDComm
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI">https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI</a>)_and_DIDComm&gt;
&gt; 2. Formats: JSON-LD, CBOR &lt;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049</a>&gt;, JWT,
&gt; XMLDSig &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature</a>&gt;, PDF/XML-Signature
&gt; 3. Document shape: JSON-LD Framing
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/">https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/</a>&gt;, JSON Schema
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a>&gt;, JSON Path &lt;<a href="https://jsonpath.com/">https://jsonpath.com/</a>&gt;-based
&gt; Validators, MongoDB Query
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/">https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/</a>&gt;
&gt; 4. Value data type-based comparison: JSON Schema, MongoDB Query, JSON

&gt; &lt;<a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa">https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa</a>&gt; (?)
&gt; 5. Semantic comparison: Trust Frameworks (?), Presentation Exchange
&gt; (?), Digital Trust Protocol (?), business logic
&gt;
&gt; As you can see it's already messy trying to fit these specs into
&gt; buckets...

&gt; I'd love to see something that did not mix Transport, Data Model, and Data
&gt; Selection concerns all into 1 spec... not saying anyone is doing this, it's
&gt; just a concern.
&gt;
&gt; DIF is trying our best to tackle just Data Selection here:
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange</a>
&gt; W3C CCG has a request specification that works with a browser polyfill
&gt; here:
&gt; <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/#example-5-a-zcap-request-query">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/#example-5-a-zcap-request-query</a>
&gt; Mattr has this OIDC proposal for client bound assertions here:
&gt; <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/</a>
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that legacy systems have formats that are not supported
&gt; well by some of the new specs... for example, the support for JWT in VC
&gt; Data Model is poor, and without the support from well known open id
&gt; configuration / other OIDF tweaks that make OIDC work... VC JWT as a format
&gt; is poorly documented and hard to use by itself... (JOSE/OIDC are fine, I am
&gt; not talking about them here). This leads to a dependency on existing
&gt; software solutions for moving JWTs around, and some real trouble with
&gt; working with decentralized identifiers.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless of the "Credential / Claim / CryptoAssertion" format... we all
&gt; need to transport them from A to B, and that means we all need a way of B
&gt; describing to A what a "well formed request" should look like, and A needs
&gt; construct that request in a way that B can understand.
&gt;
&gt; If your transport only supports 1 of the 3+ assertions formats out
&gt; there... you are obviously not going to receive credentials from people who
&gt; don't use that format.
&gt;
&gt; That's why the Presentation Exchange spec is so hard... we are trying to
&gt; solve the problem:
&gt;
&gt; Create a verifiable presentation of the credentials needed to open a bank
&gt; account... without telling people which credential format or transports
&gt; they MUST use....
&gt;
&gt; Which obviously means, as a spec, it MUST work for all formats and
&gt; transports :)

<p>US law enforcement has a long history of attempting to gain greater insight into the digital world and its data. On the legislative front, the US government is currently pushing a bill to legalize the mandate of encryption backdoors for Internet-reliant companies. In the absence of a legal enabler, the acquisition of hacked information is an alternative method for gaining access into private companies’ data. At its root, the conversation around encryption and data security boils down to whether or not it is morally acceptable to sacrifice civilian privacy and acknowledge hacking as a viable alternative to legal means of information gathering in order to potentially prevent more heinous activities such as terrorist financing, human trafficking, and child abuse. Simultaneously, the normalization of a surveillance state, where both the physical and digital worlds are controlled by law enforcement, should give the general public pause.</p>



 The Denouncement of Encryption 



<p>The US government has long pushed for the circumvention of privacy requirements in the name of law enforcement, and the legal battle around data access by law enforcement is currently being fought in Congress. US Attorney General William Barr made various <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/24/134062/trumps-justice-department-calls-for-encryption-backdoor-law/">attempts throughout 2019</a> to implement encryption backdoors (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019">not in so many words, though</a>) for tech companies. These efforts were a direct continuation of demands from the Justice Department <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">leading all the way back to the 1990s</a> to allow law enforcement agencies access to encrypted data, popularly described as the “<a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/digital-privacy/digital-divergence">going dark</a>” problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-blumenthal-hawley-feinstein-introduce-earn-it-act-to-encourage-tech-industry-to-take-online-child-sexual-exploitation-seriously">bipartisan group of senators introduced</a> a bill titled the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT Act), which would allow the government to scan every message sent online and create a commission (led by Attorney General Barr and dominated by law enforcement agencies) with the authority make new rules on “best practices” that all Internet-reliant companies would be required to follow to maintain their Section 230 protections. This bill immediately drew significant ire from big tech companies, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/oppose-earn-it-act/">privacy advocates</a>, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/01/us-senate-should-reject-earn-it-act">consumer watchdogs</a> alike because it poses a direct threat to the use of encryption and puts authority over the Internet directly in the hands of law enforcement.</p>



<p>The recent rekindling of interest in these encryption workarounds was partially triggered by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lessons-from-apple-versus-the-f-b-i">Apple’s refusal to help the FBI</a> develop a method to forcibly access data on a locked iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the perpetrators of the San Bernardino massacre that took place in December 2015. The dispute drew national attention and caused mixed reactions – a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-americans-split-on-unlocking-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/">survey conducted jointly by CBS and the New York Times</a> found a nearly even split between those that believed Apple should have unlocked the iPhone and those who supported Apple’s decision to protect user privacy. Interestingly, despite this even split, a significant majority recognized the precedent that would have been created had Apple conceded, and nearly 70% of responders believed that the phone would have become more susceptible to hacking. The FBI, which initially sued Apple in 2016 for its refusal to comply, eventually dropped the lawsuit after discovering another workaround, and the case wrapped without a decision made.&nbsp;</p>



 The Current Legal Battle 



<p>Since the Apple case, two other relevant policy debates have emerged, centered on enabling access to user data for law enforcement: Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edward Snowden’s 2013 leaks revealed how <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/13/21257481/wyden-freedom-patriot-act-amendment-mcconnell">Section 215</a> enabled the federal government to collect phone records through approval from a secret court established by the Foreign Intelligence Act (FISA). Because the court is subject to little oversight and approved most requests, the law essentially allowed for mass surveillance of citizens. This act, unsurprisingly, has proved controversial. When the PATRIOT Act was up for reauthorization this May, the Senate voted not to pass an amendment that would have banned law enforcement from obtaining internet browsing and search history data through FISA approval; however, the amendment failed to pass by only one vote, an extremely close outcome further muddied by the fact that 4 senators were unable to vote as a direct result of attendance limited by COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Washington’s push to increase law enforcement access to user data (on the part of some senators) went a step further with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/senates-new-anti-encryption-bill-even-worse-earn-it-and-thats-saying-something">Lawful Access of Encrypted Data Act</a> announced in June 2020, which would essentially force tech companies to build backdoors in their operating systems so that data can be decrypted upon request. This law presents a direct challenge to tech companies by providing another avenue for the government to surveil users with little oversight while simultaneously undermining overall user security. Had this law been effective in 2015, Apple would have had no choice but to decrypt Farook’s phone. Unsurprisingly, such legislative efforts have been met with continued criticism by <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/06/29/encr-j29.html">tech companies</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/06/lawful-access-encrypted-data-act.html">privacy experts</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/senates-new-anti-encryption-bill-even-worse-earn-it-and-thats-saying-something">nonprofits</a>.</p>



 A Lucrative Business 



<p>The use of hacked information by government agencies also validates the fraudsters behind the hacking. Currently, there are <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/study-finds-15-billion-stolen-exposed-credentials-in-criminal-markets/d/d-id/1338309">15 billion credentials</a> sourced from more than 100,000 data breaches circulating on the Dark Web and in underground marketplaces. Credentials to high-value accounts (bank accounts with confirmed high balances, accounts with privileged access to enterprise systems) are auctioned to bidders at prices ranging from $500 to $120,000 per account. And non-high-value accounts still cost a pretty penny: domain administrator accounts fetch an average of $3,139, while bank account credentials average $70.91 each. Even a <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/special-report/cybercriminal-underground-economy-series/global-black-market-for-stolen-data/">list of active phone numbers</a> can sell for up to nearly $2,000.</p>



<p>Concurrently, we are witnessing the <a href="https://threatpost.com/15-billion-credentials-currently-up-for-grabs-on-hacker-forums/157247/">growth of account takeover-as-a-service</a>, which allows for the temporary “rental” of identities. The tacit acknowledgment by law enforcement of the value of such data, in conjunction with the already lucrative prices associated with selling and “renting” identities, may very well embolden the actions of fraudsters and expose the personal data and details of more civilian users.</p>



 The Takeaway 



<p>How can we reconcile this behavior by law enforcement agencies against existing privacy regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which places further control of personal data into consumer hands? Consumer data does not transform into public property just because it has been hacked. As such, consumers should have recourse in deciding whether or not to allow companies to sell their information, and provide or withhold consent from law enforcement agencies to access or use sensitive personal data.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, we need to consider the ethics around online data and stolen data. Is it morally acceptable to circumvent existing privacy laws in order to prevent activity that is “more” illegal? Weighing the pros and cons when considering the use of hacked data by law enforcement, does the potential for good outweigh the authenticity it lends to bad actors? If given the choice between hacking and heinous illegal activity such as terrorism funding, human trafficking, or child abuse, can we afford to fund the lesser of two evils?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Performing this kind of cost-benefit analysis requires the consideration of a grey morality. In the absence of a regulatory decision being made to require or forbid the implementation of encryption backdoors, we need to decide if the crimes that may be prevented are worth the validation of hacking, the loss of civilian privacy, and the normalization of a surveillance state.</p>

<p>The latest release of Hyperledger Besu is now available for download. The 1.5 version offers better performance and improved enterprise functionality.</p>



<p>In February, Hyperledger Besu 1.4 was released. Since then, we’ve been concentrating on continuing to bring <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu">Hyperledger Besu</a> users the best experience among enterprise blockchain clients. Today, we’re announcing the release of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/1.5.0">Hyperledger Besu 1.5</a>, which brings with it significant improvements to performance, usability, and privacy.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Besu 1.5 comes with primary upgrades that focus on enterprise requirements.</p>



<p>PRIMARY UPGRADES: HYPERLEDGER BESU 1.5</p>



<p>Privacy</p>



<p>The most recent set of privacy enhancements include:</p>



  Ability to add and remove members from privacy groups.  Filters and subscriptions for private contracts.  Web3j and web3js support for private transactions and filters.  



<p>Read more about <a href="https://pegasys.tech/privacy-upgrades-for-hyperledger-besu-1-5/">privacy enhancements in Besu 1.5</a>.</p>

  Added native encryption libraries to provide optimization optionality  EVM execution improvements  Improved logs querying performance&nbsp;  Improved transactions per second (TPS) performance by 33%   



<p>Look for more details on the improvements in an upcoming blog post.</p>



<p>Parity Tracing APIs</p>



<p>In the Hyperledger <a href="https://pegasys.tech/announcing-hyperledger-besu-1-4-available-now/">Besu 1.4 upgrade</a>, we introduced new tracing APIs as early access features. Since then, we’ve ensured they worked smoothly across every edge case we could find and are now ready to suggest using them by default.</p>







<p>“Hands-on with Hyperledger Besu” is a guided introduction to Besu, hosted by some of the people who build, maintain, train, and work with the Ethereum client. The program is a four-week, detailed introduction to building with the client. <a href="https://pages.consensys.net/hyperledger-besu-hands-on">Sign up and start learning about Besu today</a>.</p>



<p>EARLY ACCESS FEATURES</p>



<p>The following features are still under active development, may not be documented and have unstable APIs. Nevertheless, because community feedback is valuable to their development, we want to share them as “early access” features. All feedback and questions are welcomed in our <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors">contributor chat</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EIP-1559 Support<br>Hyperledger Besu has been one of the clients leading the implementation of EIP-1559, a major upgrade to Ethereum’s transaction fee market. The upgrade will allow better transaction fee estimation and faster transaction inclusion in periods of high demand on the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ephemeral Testnet YOLO<br>In preparation for the next network upgrade, Berlin, an ephemeral testnet called YOLO was launched with two new EIPs enabled: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315">EIP-2315</a>, which adds subroutines to the EVM, and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537">EIP-2537</a>, which introduces a new precompile for the BLS12-381 curve.</p>



<p>While the network is currently down (its status can be seen at <a href="https://yolonet.xyz/">https://yolonet.xyz/</a>) Hyperledger Besu is YOLO-compatible.&nbsp;</p>

 Finding the Bell Curve of&nbsp;Meaning <p>A process for supporting the emergence of shared language in broad collaborative communities</p><p>by Kaliya Young &amp; Margo&nbsp;Johnson</p> Introduction <p>The identity community focused on user-centric ID gathers twice a year at the Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>), an event at the crossroads of more than a dozen open standards working groups focused on various aspects of digital identity.</p><p>At IIW29 in October of 2019, a session was called to assess the creation of a glossary to support the convergence of meaning around key terms that were being used in relationship to the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies. The small group convened there was led by Kaliya Young (Identity Woman), Margo Johnson (Transmute Industries), and Drummond Reed (Evernym), and included a variety of perspectives from other contributors like Adrian Gropper (HIE of One) and Juan Caballero (Spherity).</p><p>We considered several sources ahead of beginning the process towards glossary creation. We looked at the past history of glossaries in the community, including the <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Identity Gang Lexicon</a> from 2005, which was created in the very early days of the community that would come together over the following fifteen years (Kaliya and Drummond were active at that time). There was the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/">Sovrin Glossary</a>(2016; 2019; 2019), which in its current form contains 248 terms as a potential source we could draw terms from. We also spoke with Daniel Hardman about his approach to glossary work, where one defines key concepts with a functional description but no name, and then when all the concepts are outlined collectively, names are decided all at once upon firm concepts.</p><p>We also drew on the work of Eugene Kim, who<a href="http://fasterthan20.com/framework/high-performance-groups/"> focuses on high performance collaboration, </a>one of the key elements for which is the social processes of developing “Shared Understanding” and “Shared Language” are social processes:</p>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110812181030/http://blueoxen.net/wiki/Shared_Understanding">Shared Understanding</a> is when two people or groups use different words for the same things or the same words for different things, but because of enough social contact, they can actually understand what is being communicated.  <a href="http://blueoxen.net/wiki/Shared_Language">Shared Language</a> emerges if you have sufficient contact between groups/people such that their word choice becomes decidedly aligned.  <p>We were mindful of this when we chose the process for this glossary work. And we wanted it to be inclusive, so we listened carefully to the current diversity of language that was already being used throughout the community. The meaning of key words wasn’t ours to fix or define; we aimed to establish a composite of the digital identity vernacular as we encountered it.</p><p>Community members urged us to create a glossary, pointing to confusion “in the market” about what key terms meant. Ultimately, we learned that this request represented a variety of impulses, which spawned some confusion about our efforts. It was clear from the beginning that the work should not seek to define terms at the level where they are being used within technical working groups where significant time was being devoted to defining key terms locally within a given technical specification. The energy of the group got behind better understanding how words are used in every day language and conversation in the marketing level documents.</p><p>As such, we aimed to invite alignment around key words, to find the “bell curve of meaning,” and to invite convergence towards the middle of this curve as a result of our research process. Our hope was to maximize the ability to inform and engage business audiences interested in adopting/purchasing this technology. This meant we would not be setting out to define hundreds of terms; rather, we chose to focus on a subset of the most widely used&nbsp;terms.</p> Methodology <p>First, our group created and circulated a survey throughout the broader digital identity community to identify key terms to focus on. The group chairs designed the survey by brainstorming a starting list of terms (based on working knowledge of the space), and respondents also had the option to add their own. Respondents ranked the provided terms from highest to lowest priority. The chairs reviewed these results and chose three of the top-ranked terms as a starting point for the glossary&nbsp;process.</p><blockquote>In the case of this research those terms were “agent”, “wallet”, and “credential.”</blockquote><p>One other term — “self sovereign identity” — was actually rated as the most important by this process. However, the group ultimately decided that this hot-button term would be best approached after a more foundational understanding of supporting terms was in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Having defined three targets for building clarity and consensus, we then created and shared a second survey asking respondents about their working descriptions for each of the three terms, as well as how those terms relate to each other. We worked from an assumption that understanding the relationships between the terms would help us better understand their meaning. Several additional questions about the company business model were also included to provide context about respondents. This survey was distributed via multiple mailing lists to a broad swath of community groups working in decentralized identity, verifiable credential, blockchain, and data privacy&nbsp;space.</p> Analysis <p>After several weeks, the second survey had twenty seven responses from various companies, and our group was able to start with community data analysis efforts. The chairs took some time to consider different analysis options, prioritizing those that were digital, inclusive, participatory, fast, and free. We wanted to minimize any barrier to community members engaging in the process. Finally, we designed a framework in Google Sheets whereby qualitative responses to each question were inductively sorted into emergent groups that we named and modified in real-time, helping us understand common themes as well as areas of divergence. You can picture this as a digital version of hundreds of post-its all over a wall, being moved around by different people until they eventually fall into groups, and those groups are given a big post-it name after an iterative process of redistribution and renaming. This is a creative combination of human-centered design practices such as affinity diagramming, <a href="http://library.ac4d.com/d/AC4D_designlibrary_Design_synthesis.pdf">d</a>e<a href="http://library.ac4d.com/d/AC4D_designlibrary_Design_synthesis.pdf">sign synthesis</a>, and insight combinations.</p><p>Using this analytical framework, the glossary group met weekly for an hour over several months to read through the survey responses together and create groupings. Additional participants rotated in and out throughout the process, offering different perspectives and helping to refine the approach. The approach was messy at times, with responses falling into multiple groups or defying categorization altogether. However we persisted, and noted interesting discussions and reflections that emerged in the process. Once we finished grouping all the responses, we combed through the data once more, cleaning it up a bit, merging groups where there was high overlap and clarifying the final description for each&nbsp;group.</p><p>Upon completing the grouping process we counted the number of responses in each group across each term and relationship type to determine which concepts came up the most frequently, potentially indicating the highest level of alignment across respondents. We also looked at the number of groups per term/relationship as an indication of convergence or divergence in responses.</p><p>Looking at this qualitative and quantitative information, the group took the final step of writing working descriptions for each of the three key terms. This involved looking at the 2–4 groups for each term with the highest number of related responses and constructing a phrase from their group descriptions. This was a surprisingly smooth process for the review team — in particular for the terms “wallet” and “credential” — where there was a higher level of consensus. One notable challenge we faced was with the term “agent” based on the large number of groups included, and while we were able to construct a more complex phrase, the difficulty arriving at that point became a finding in its own right. Interestingly, while the term agent had the highest level of divergence and outlier definitions, it also had one group — “representative of the subject” — with the highest number of relevant responses in the whole survey at 21. This could be interpreted as meaning that the term agent actually has a high level of convergence around this core representation property, and then individual implementations diverge in other agent features.</p><blockquote>Aggregated Descriptions (Agent, Wallet, Credentials)</blockquote><blockquote>Credentials: Credentials provide structured standards for accessing identity&nbsp;data</blockquote><blockquote>Wallets: Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agent:</blockquote><blockquote>SIMPLE: Dictionary definition: “a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect”</blockquote><blockquote>NUANCED: An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>For the relationships between the terms, we found that the simplest way to share the results was to create a diagram showing the relationships (see below) and to list out all of the group titles there. This helped to show the diversity and multi-directional nature of those relationships.</p> Sharing Results <p>Our group built a simple, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gIEPmbtLNVuaHxdawGBe6ZwFqP43m7iqmIEeUUm3sjI/edit#slide=id.g752184a474_0_4">publicly visible presentation</a> to share details of the process, results, and next steps. In this deck, we emphasized descriptive rather than prescriptive results, noting that this was one way of better understanding our shared landscape and taking actions together to build market understanding and product language.</p><p>We presented this deck and answered community questions within the same community groups where the original work was spawned,, as well as running a session at the 30th Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">full notes here</a>). The feedback was generally positive.</p><p>Reflecting on the process, what remains to be seen is how the community will utilize these terms, and whether we will see a further convergence towards shared meaning as a result of this work. We have already seen this work referenced in discussions when shared vocabulary issues are raised, and we know that several publicly traded companies active in the industry are also sharing this internally. We are also preparing to follow up and share the results with respondents to complete the feedback&nbsp;cycle.</p> Conclusion and Next&nbsp;Steps <p>From an information-sharing perspective, the group hopes to continue to share this work out into related communities, and encourage further conversations and actions. We particularly want to encourage conversations at a market level, connecting standards to businesses today.</p><p>Moving forward, the glossary group hopes to do another round of definitions using the same process. We also want to continue to explore specific impacts of this work to gauge its continued value for the broader community.</p><p>We hope that other communities can learn from our experience, and use this process or iterations of it to support the emergence of shared language in their communities. From a research process perspective, we would love to see other groups leverage this methodology, see how it works for them, and offer process and marketing improvements that can benefit everyone.

&gt; DIF is trying our best to tackle just Data Selection here: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange</a>
&gt; W3C CCG has a request specification that works with a browser polyfill here: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/#example-5-a-zcap-request-query">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/#example-5-a-zcap-request-query</a>
&gt; Mattr has this OIDC proposal for client bound assertions here: <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/</a>
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that legacy systems have formats that are not supported well by some of the new specs... for example, the support for JWT in VC Data Model is poor, and without the support from well known open id configuration / other OIDF tweaks that make OIDC work... VC JWT as a format is poorly documented and hard to use by itself... (JOSE/OIDC are fine, I am not talking about them here). This leads to a dependency on existing software solutions for moving JWTs around, and some real trouble with working with decentralized identifiers.
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of the "Credential / Claim / CryptoAssertion" format... we all need to transport them from A to B, and that means we all need a way of B describing to A what a "well formed request" should look like, and A needs construct that request in a way that B can understand.
&gt; 
&gt; If your transport only supports 1 of the 3+ assertions formats out there... you are obviously not going to receive credentials from people who don't use that format.
&gt; 
&gt; That's why the Presentation Exchange spec is so hard... we are trying to solve the problem: 
&gt; 
&gt; Create a verifiable presentation of the credentials needed to open a bank account... without telling people which credential format or transports they MUST use.... 
&gt; 
&gt; Which obviously means, as a spec, it MUST work for all formats and transports :)

         It should also be given great consideration that JSON Schema comes from an internationally recognized SDO (standards defining organization) rather than a “public trust organization” (the unique term coming from the OIDF site).  JSON Schema also has numerous implementations in various languages and is in use in many places today.

All of that would seem to be reasons to utilize it instead

I will point out that a number of organizations have extended JSON Schema in a standardized way.  See the use of JSON Schema in Adobe’s XDM at </a><a href="https://github.com/adobe/xdm">https://github.com/adobe/xdm</a>, where we have added standard types for things mentioned here such as date-time or rational numbers through the use of JSON schema format (see <a href="https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/docs/data_types.md">https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/docs/data_types.md</a> for more info).

As I understand it , JSON Schema has been through many IETF draft revisions, so I think they are making the effort to standardized in some reasonable timeframe. I don’t think JSON Path is in scope for this, but there does seem to be some recent movement toward codifying it (very early IETF community doc). There may be great reason to do this, I just want to understand what exact cases I would need to use this, vs other general conventions we have in use for other things that seem similar.

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for taking the time to review this.

You are correct, the spec is high-level on purpose and we also specify that those simple operations are just a proposal and examples are not normative.
Given that specification is valid for somebody to extend OpenId in such a way, I believe it would make sense to clearly define what are the types and operations you want to support. It would also make sense to agree that same definition with a wider group of organizations operating under the same marketplace or trust framework.

Anyway, by providing OP Metadata using the Discovery endpoint, consumers/RPs will at least understand the available capabilities.

Hope this helps
Alberto

Subject: #External Sender# RE: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

I am trying to better understand this part of your response: “We defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules” – are you saying the spec itself does not define normative rules for specific types and the processing steps involved in parsing/evaluating their values? For instance, someone cited that the spec shows examples of string-based two-place decimal values being compared for monetary purposes, which I would think implies a series of steps where you would have to cast the strings to numeric values and perform math operations to validate, but I didn’t see any definition of those types, or the processing rules that define how to evaluate them, in the body of the draft. Am I correct in thinking this spec is codifying high-level expression properties (eq, gt, lt, etc.), with type and processing rule definition/evaluation being left to userspace?

Subject: Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hi Kristina and all,

Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.

I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward this issue under eyk-ida WG.

We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so that user privacy is enhanced.

It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively contributing.

The overall Santander project public documentation can be found here: <a href="https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/">https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C7e768d5602bd4057a10108d829c1cd95%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637305259664448640&amp;sdata=UVv%2BB">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C7e768d5602bd4057a10108d829c1cd95%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637305259664448640&amp;sdata=UVv%2BB</a>olHyBqxRTE8tGbKnWq05cnv%2BmH6hxjFAGl1TLw%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;

Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before comparing the data.


Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!

Kind regards

Subject: #External Sender# Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

+ Alberto who wrote the expression language spec.

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0&lt;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C7e768d5602bd4057a10108d829c1cd95%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637305259664458635&amp;sdata=uDQnhsQDEQyYQ">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C7e768d5602bd4057a10108d829c1cd95%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637305259664458635&amp;sdata=uDQnhsQDEQyYQ</a>9TR3nWx%2B4b%2FQZgN9MVS4SxExiFrnEg%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; OIDF's current proposal is outlined here &lt;<a href="https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html">https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html</a>&gt;. For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for taking the time to review this.

You are correct, the spec is high-level on purpose and we also specify that those simple operations are just a proposal and examples are not normative.
Given that specification is valid for somebody to extend OpenId in such a way, I believe it would make sense to clearly define what are the types and operations you want to support. It would also make sense to agree that same definition with a wider group of organizations operating under the same marketplace or trust framework.

Anyway, by providing OP Metadata using the Discovery endpoint, consumers/RPs will at least understand the available capabilities.

Hope this helps
Alberto

Subject: #External Sender# RE: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

I am trying to better understand this part of your response: “We defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules” – are you saying the spec itself does not define normative rules for specific types and the processing steps involved in parsing/evaluating their values? For instance, someone cited that the spec shows examples of string-based two-place decimal values being compared for monetary purposes, which I would think implies a series of steps where you would have to cast the strings to numeric values and perform math operations to validate, but I didn’t see any definition of those types, or the processing rules that define how to evaluate them, in the body of the draft. Am I correct in thinking this spec is codifying high-level expression properties (eq, gt, lt, etc.), with type and processing rule definition/evaluation being left to userspace?

Subject: Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hi Kristina and all,

Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.

I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward this issue under eyk-ida WG.

We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so that user privacy is enhanced.

It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively contributing.

The overall Santander project public documentation can be found here: <a href="https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/">https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cec2399d5efe64abe791208d829ab0fb8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305162013972964%7CU">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cec2399d5efe64abe791208d829ab0fb8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305162013972964%7CU</a>nknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=PflgzxoiaNoNrRfsgMHDe639RBn0M%2Fq1%2BdbfjKE4RAA%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;

Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before comparing the data.


Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!

Kind regards

+ Alberto who wrote the expression language spec.

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cec2399d5efe64abe791208d829ab0fb8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305162013982952%7CUnknown">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cec2399d5efe64abe791208d829ab0fb8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305162013982952%7CUnknown</a>%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=Zp0GxIOqIYwmqtdQa6jlpuSq2Q5QYra6VML6VdfBcuo%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt;
&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from
&gt; universal identifiers like

These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than recreating JSON Schema.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; OIDF's current proposal is outlined here &lt;<a href="https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html">https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html</a>&gt;. For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

Mattr has this OIDC proposal for client bound assertions here:
<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/</a>

The problem is that legacy systems have formats that are not supported well
by some of the new specs... for example, the support for JWT in VC Data
Model is poor, and without the support from well known open id
configuration / other OIDF tweaks that make OIDC work... VC JWT as a format
is poorly documented and hard to use by itself... (JOSE/OIDC are fine, I am
not talking about them here). This leads to a dependency on existing
software solutions for moving JWTs around, and some real trouble with
working with decentralized identifiers.

Regardless of the "Credential / Claim / CryptoAssertion" format... we all
need to transport them from A to B, and that means we all need a way of B
describing to A what a "well formed request" should look like, and A needs
construct that request in a way that B can understand.

If your transport only supports 1 of the 3+ assertions formats out there...
you are obviously not going to receive credentials from people who don't
use that format.

That's why the Presentation Exchange spec is so hard... we are trying to
solve the problem:

Create a verifiable presentation of the credentials needed to open a bank
account... without telling people which credential format or transports
they MUST use....

Which obviously means, as a spec, it MUST work for all formats and
transports :)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for taking the time to review this.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You are correct, the spec is high-level on purpose and we also specify
&gt; that those simple operations are just a proposal and examples are not
&gt; normative.
&gt;
&gt; Given that specification is valid for somebody to extend OpenId in such a
&gt; way, I believe it would make sense to clearly define what are the types and
&gt; operations you want to support. It would also make sense to agree that same
&gt; definition with a wider group of organizations operating under the same
&gt; marketplace or trust framework.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, by providing OP Metadata using the Discovery endpoint,
&gt; consumers/RPs will at least understand the available capabilities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps
&gt;
&gt; Alberto
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; I am trying to better understand this part of your response: “We defined
&gt; the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types
&gt; and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with
&gt; their own rules” – are you saying the spec itself does not define normative
&gt; rules for specific types and the processing steps involved in
&gt; parsing/evaluating their values? For instance, someone cited that the spec
&gt; shows examples of string-based two-place decimal values being compared for
&gt; monetary purposes, which I would think implies a series of steps where you
&gt; would have to cast the strings to numeric values and perform math
&gt; operations to validate, but I didn’t see any definition of those types, or
&gt; the processing rules that define how to evaluate them, in the body of the
&gt; draft. Am I correct in thinking this spec is codifying high-level
&gt; expression properties (eq, gt, lt, etc.), with type and processing rule
&gt; definition/evaluation being left to userspace?

&gt; *Subject:* Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and
&gt; "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi Kristina and all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward
&gt; this issue under eyk-ida WG.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to
&gt; OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so
&gt; that user privacy is enhanced.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research
&gt; project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work
&gt; for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community
&gt; to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar
&gt; problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could
&gt; provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof
&gt; or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request
&gt; for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to
&gt; influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively
&gt; contributing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The overall Santander project public documentation can be found here:

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name
&gt; for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP
&gt; defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the
&gt; implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when
&gt; implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library
&gt; from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before
&gt; comparing the data.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great
&gt; opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the
&gt; same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative

&gt; That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets
&gt; promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier
&gt; to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references
&gt; to ISO currency codes (

&gt; in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation
&gt; operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON
&gt; Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it
&gt; (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I
&gt; haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure
&gt; about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).
&gt;
&gt; Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around
&gt; processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root
&gt; cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in
&gt; a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of
&gt; operator definition.
&gt;
&gt; I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the
&gt; specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt; &gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the
&gt; spec.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; &gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; &gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt; &gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; &gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; &gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; &gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; &gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from

&gt; These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave
&gt; + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this
&gt; problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity
&gt; consolidate efforts.

&gt; which could be more generic than "ageOver18" property in VC imp-guide and
&gt; ekyc-ida wg has been wondering if we could work together on this important
&gt; topic.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; OIDF's current proposal is outlined here &lt;
&gt; <a href="https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html">https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html</a>&gt;.
&gt; For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in
&gt; Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to
&gt; express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is
&gt; 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for taking the time to review this.

You are correct, the spec is high-level on purpose and we also specify that those simple operations are just a proposal and examples are not normative.
Given that specification is valid for somebody to extend OpenId in such a way, I believe it would make sense to clearly define what are the types and operations you want to support. It would also make sense to agree that same definition with a wider group of organizations operating under the same marketplace or trust framework.

Anyway, by providing OP Metadata using the Discovery endpoint, consumers/RPs will at least understand the available capabilities.

Hope this helps
Alberto

I am trying to better understand this part of your response: “We defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules” – are you saying the spec itself does not define normative rules for specific types and the processing steps involved in parsing/evaluating their values? For instance, someone cited that the spec shows examples of string-based two-place decimal values being compared for monetary purposes, which I would think implies a series of steps where you would have to cast the strings to numeric values and perform math operations to validate, but I didn’t see any definition of those types, or the processing rules that define how to evaluate them, in the body of the draft. Am I correct in thinking this spec is codifying high-level expression properties (eq, gt, lt, etc.), with type and processing rule definition/evaluation being left to userspace?

Subject: Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hi Kristina and all,

Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.

I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward this issue under eyk-ida WG.

We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so that user privacy is enhanced.

It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively contributing.

The overall Santander project public documentation can be found here: <a href="https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/">https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ctonynad%40microsoft.com%7C2799165eb8844b2317a908d82999ab5d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305087280535810&amp;sdata=Qtnr">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ctonynad%40microsoft.com%7C2799165eb8844b2317a908d82999ab5d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305087280535810&amp;sdata=Qtnr</a>So4yQdXBOBvnvlkhBTCCItt4H1eYgBu0OQ9Ru20%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;

Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before comparing the data.


Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!

Kind regards

+ Alberto who wrote the expression language spec.

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ctonynad%40microsoft.com%7C2799165eb8844b2317a908d82999ab5d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305087280545802&amp;sdata=y5%2BwG01a">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ctonynad%40microsoft.com%7C2799165eb8844b2317a908d82999ab5d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305087280545802&amp;sdata=y5%2BwG01a</a>qWHEY26F5MPE6K0sxjMUcu0VYm8Hryl0xT4%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt;
&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt;
&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from
&gt; universal identifiers like

These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than recreating JSON Schema.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; OIDF's current proposal is outlined here &lt;<a href="https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html">https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html</a>&gt;. For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

<p>Banks in Europe have deployed customer authentication solutions for several years. These solutions have served their purpose well and enabled customers to safely log in to their bank accounts. In the world of e-commerce, these solutions, when used, have been successful in combating online payment fraud. The success of PSD2 will ultimately be determined by how well banks can balance user convenience with security obligations, while maximizing reach. As such, they may want to evaluate how well their legacy authentication solutions meet this new need. FIDO authentication standards have been proposed as a way for banks to meet all requirements in a PSD2 world — but is the change from a legacy method to FIDO worthwhile?

Subject: Re: RE: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hi, Daniel.

Sorry, I will try to be more verbose this time.


  *   Extensible: phone_number not only require a format and constrain but all the rules that have to follow to fulfil equality. In the implementation, before any comparation we execute a normalization. This normalization is associated to the type of the data evaluated in this specific predicate. Decimal  (text representation of an arbitrary precision number) is another example, before executing a “gt” the type requires a transformation that support this kind of comparation, it is not compare as a String but as a number. As you could see the scope of the language differ a little. The assertion (I really do not like this name…) language is the body of a predicate, and the types expose not only format and constrains but operations as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But where are these specific types, and their value processing rules, defined? Is the spec defining these types, or is it a framework that implies a userland definition of the types will happen ad hoc between participants?


  *   Safe: At the point of we made our minds,  we want the relaying parties (the ones that code the assertion) to  have a flexible language, but we were afraid of what kind of contraptions they could build, some people could have an incredible mind. We could further discuss this point, we appreciate as much feedback as possible as you do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the types are codified (along with their processing, regexes, and other evaluatory bits), then I don’t understand why you would need to fear someone creating a document with some string/number value of a given type. If this is not codifying the actual types, and that is something defined ad hoc in the code of every userland exchange, that could be an issue.


  *   Natural language: When the user has to “consent” a request from the RP, the UI has to present an “easy to understand” sentence about what the relaying party is asking. The possible outcomes of the consent in case of an assertion claim are: True, False or Missing/User rejects disclosure. (Error too…). Therefore the expression is “translated” to natural language. Example: assertion for the claim “age” { “gte”: 16 }, is translated to  “User is at least 16 old”.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So what you’re saying here is that you want to ensure that any type/value system used can have known properties and that you can give verbose word equivalences to for composition of UI representation? That makes sense, but I am trying to understand why that’s uniquely produced by this particular construction, vs others that may exist.

As you could see, I did not understand well the question about the type system, could you help me with that?  This “assertion claims” are not related to proof, even ZKP.

I am not sure I fully understand the issues in the bullet points you listed below for “Extensible”, “Safe”, and “Easy to translate to natural language”. Can you help clarify why something like a phone number would not work as an addition to the set of built-in formats (<a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats">https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjson-schema.org%2Funderstanding-json-schema%2Freference%2Fstring.html%23built-in-formats&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cb36cd526d91143f7050608d829996d85%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjson-schema.org%2Funderstanding-json-schema%2Freference%2Fstring.html%23built-in-formats&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cb36cd526d91143f7050608d829996d85%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd</a>011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305086255033369&amp;sdata=MmupZ7%2B2h0sqtmp051GufoQXLq0o2AZOcBlnJ2KnaCU%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) for something like JSON Schema? I understand that regex eval can be a vector for certain processing/perf issues when evaluating regexes from untrusted userland parties, but given a set of types for common ZKP circuits would need to be standardized, and their type/value parsing logic strictly codified, why would such an issue exist for the standard type system and those using libraries coded to evaluate that type system? I am not really clear on the last bullet, but an example that shows how one would ‘not know what is going on’ vs ‘know what is going on’, might help.

Subject: Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hello everyone,

We considered many alternatives for the design of the assertion language, but first of all the name. Predicate is indeed a better name, false or true are both valid outcomes. On the other hand Assertions could be interrelated as the only valid option is true and false is a failure.

About the expression language, we consider different approaches:


  *   MongoDB “where” language
  *   JSON Schema types and constrains.
  *   A Expression language like Spring EL

At the end we choose something like the mongodb query syntax but without the problem of mixing operands and literals that gave them so many problems.

Some of the requirements were:

  *   Extensible: Adding types like phone_number that require a normalization before execution without including this massive dependencies.
  *   Safe: For example, regular expression are forbidden to avoid ReDoS.
  *   Easy to translate to natural language: The owner of the data must know what is going on… 😃

JSON Schema was discarded for those reasons and because the scope of the language is validation not a simple predicate. The current implementations are bind to that rule.

Subject: Re: #External Sender# Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hi Kristina and all,

Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.

I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward this issue under eyk-ida WG.

We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so that user privacy is enhanced.

It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively contributing.

The overall Santander project public documentation can be found here: <a href="https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/">https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cb36cd526d91143f7050608d829996d85%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305086255033369&amp;sda">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cb36cd526d91143f7050608d829996d85%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305086255033369&amp;sda</a>ta=qi%2FSGNirt5FRqaoXGuak9kHqP63L066IcngkMlld5S0%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;

Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before comparing the data.


Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!

Kind regards

+ Alberto who wrote the expression language spec.

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cb36cd526d91143f7050608d829996d85%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305086255043360&amp;sdata=Use">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cb36cd526d91143f7050608d829996d85%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637305086255043360&amp;sdata=Use</a>nOeTEv8%2BOgpfiUArENMk9NANZyBBwG6Sh7UohMyo%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from
&gt; universal identifiers like

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; OIDF's current proposal is outlined here &lt;<a href="https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html">https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html</a>&gt;. For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

I understand that regex eval can be a vector for certain processing/perf issues when evaluating regexes from untrusted userland parties, but given a set of types for common ZKP circuits would need to be standardized, and their type/value parsing logic strictly codified, why would such an issue exist for the standard type system and those using libraries coded to evaluate that type system? I am not really clear on the last bullet, but an example that shows how one would ‘not know what is going on’ vs ‘know what is going on’, might help.

Subject: Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hello everyone,

We considered many alternatives for the design of the assertion language, but first of all the name. Predicate is indeed a better name, false or true are both valid outcomes. On the other hand Assertions could be interrelated as the only valid option is true and false is a failure.

About the expression language, we consider different approaches:


  *   MongoDB “where” language
  *   JSON Schema types and constrains.
  *   A Expression language like Spring EL

At the end we choose something like the mongodb query syntax but without the problem of mixing operands and literals that gave them so many problems.

Some of the requirements were:

  *   Extensible: Adding types like phone_number that require a normalization before execution without including this massive dependencies.
  *   Safe: For example, regular expression are forbidden to avoid ReDoS.
  *   Easy to translate to natural language: The owner of the data must know what is going on… 😃

JSON Schema was discarded for those reasons and because the scope of the language is validation not a simple predicate. The current implementations are bind to that rule.

Hi Kristina and all,

Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.

I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward this issue under eyk-ida WG.

We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so that user privacy is enhanced.

It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively contributing.

Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before comparing the data.


Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!

Kind regards

Subject: #External Sender# Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

+ Alberto who wrote the expression language spec.

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cc928520695404cb308c108d8297a7942%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304954009395447&amp;sdata=og3">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Cc928520695404cb308c108d8297a7942%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304954009395447&amp;sdata=og3</a>KCL5RhS5yvj%2FKNFBSMqhABpGAbA8GjBIJUnW8JD0%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt; Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and
&gt; "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG
&gt;
&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt;
&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from
&gt; universal identifiers like

These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than recreating JSON Schema.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; OIDF's current proposal is outlined here &lt;<a href="https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html">https://gruposantander.github..io/digital-trust-docs/assertions/claim-assertions-00.html</a>&gt;. For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

         <a>I am trying to better understand this part of your response: “We defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules” – are you saying the spec itself does not define normative rules for specific types and the processing steps involved in parsing/evaluating their values? For instance, someone cited that the spec shows examples of string-based two-place decimal values being compared for monetary purposes, which I would think implies a series of steps where you would have to cast the strings to numeric values and perform math operations to validate, but I didn’t see any definition of those types, or the processing rules that define how to evaluate them, in the body of the draft. Am I correct in thinking this spec is codifying high-level expression properties (eq, gt, lt, etc.), with type and processing rule definition/evaluation being left to userspace?

Subject: Re: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hi Kristina and all,

Thanks for looping me in, also adding Victor and Rod to the thread.

I include as well Anthony and Mark, since they are helping moving forward this issue under eyk-ida WG.

We did this specification with the intention to create an extension to OpenId, where a new type of claims (assertions/predicates)  is in place, so that user privacy is enhanced.

It is part of a wider set of specs we´ve been working as a research project and based on actual use cases we have identified that could work for us. However, we are trying to contribute and reach to a wider community to see if some of those ideas help providing standards for solving similar problems that W3C VC solves. Actually, we always though somehow we could provide the transport layer for Verifiable Credentials in a form of proof or evidence in case the RP demands it, always associated with the request for a particular verified claim/set of claims. Our aim is as well to influence the great work done by the ekyc-ida WG, were we are actively contributing.

The overall Santander project public documentation can be found here: <a href="https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/">https://gruposantander.github.io/digital-trust-docs/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Ceeeb61d1843f4acd5dcd08d82975570e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304931343270775&amp;sda">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Ceeeb61d1843f4acd5dcd08d82975570e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304931343270775&amp;sda</a>ta=Jv02jx56qo%2FmNai4gN7VrTRYnkbQqqRsvKI28LRjQj0%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;

Regarding assertions (maybe derivative predicates it´s even a better name for what we did!), we defined the specs to be extensible so that each OP defines their own claim types and supported operands, and leaving the implementation of the spec with their own rules. For instance, when implementing the phone_number operand for “eq”, we did plugin a library from google (google-libphonenumber) to normalize the data before comparing the data.


Happy to jump into a call and provide more info if needed, I do see great opportunity now that we are connected thanks to Kristina and Mark!

Kind regards

+ Alberto who wrote the expression language spec.

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0&lt;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Ceeeb61d1843f4acd5dcd08d82975570e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304931343270775&amp;sdata=pI">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7Ceeeb61d1843f4acd5dcd08d82975570e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304931343270775&amp;sdata=pI</a>%2F3PyrD%2BNdJN%2FXj4uyvCo%2F4YcSwiQDktskV1td1fv0%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt;
&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from
&gt; universal identifiers like

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

If derivative predicates and expression language are trying to achieve the same (looks like they are, correct me if I am wrong), can derivative predicates also be achieved via modifications to JSON Schema?

That's an interesting proposal to extend JSON Schema. If one day it gets promoted to an IETF standard from its draft status, that might get easier to do. I'm curious about the direction of supporting things like references to ISO currency codes (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iso.org%2Fiso-4217-currency-codes.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;</a>;sdata=b3t5XY%2FHT0zaSV%2B0oO8VPreNTKC1wu96SrwHkIHH2HY%3D&amp;reserved=0) in some kind of claims request language, and URI-referenced validation operations on top of that. JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt; Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and
&gt; "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG
&gt;
&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt;
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain
&gt; semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on
&gt; strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:
&gt; <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2Fassertions%2Fclaim-assertions-00.html%23name-example&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2Fassertions%2Fclaim-assertions-00.html%23name-example&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf</a>86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;sdata=20dNlGdQOW6OPIOuCfC8jOOLgJnEjH4fcZkBdBOVmw4%3D&amp;reserved=0
&gt;
&gt; It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as
&gt; strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting
&gt; settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a
&gt; capabilities negotiation section with
&gt; "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from
&gt; universal identifiers like
&gt; "<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fschema.bigbankstandards.com%2Foperators%2Fgt&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;am">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fschema.bigbankstandards.com%2Foperators%2Fgt&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKristina.Yasuda%40microsoft.com%7Cf4fcb1e315dc442a258808d8293a6aeb%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304678180868210&amp;am</a>p;sdata=ECb4KnJl%2Bf1Ci9t%2B8d45mZsNDv%2BeKK%2FQzPxssEWBUIc%3D&amp;reserved=0". These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than recreating JSON Schema.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

JSON Schema is focused on validating JSON Document structures only, so this direction might be out of scope for it (and admittedly I'm pretty ignorant around JSON Hyper-Schema for which I haven't been able to find many well-supported libraries, and also not sure about its possible relationship to JSON-LD for that matter).

Furthermore, if the validation operators have special rules around processing typed values (for example, "the given HTTPS URL must be CA root cert-valid and resolve to 200 OK"), then it would probably have to live in a separate use case-specific extension to JSON Schema or other form of operator definition.

I think a similar conversation in Presentation Exchange involves the specification of trust frameworks hosted somewhere else:

&gt; 
&gt; Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.
&gt; 
&gt; In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain

For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than..

         Wow, if that's the case, it's super unfortunate, because they can do literally every other type/value evaluation with JSON Schema. Have they consider working to add a stringified numeric type to JSON Schema? Seems like such a good opportunity to add value to an existing thing that does 90% of what they want.

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: "Derivative predicate" of W3C VC WG and "Expression Language" of OIDF ekyc-ida WG

Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.

In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:
<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2Fassertions%2Fclaim-assertions-00.html%23name-example&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7C8856a60f31f142f0399508d8292c9f9c%7C72f988bf8">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgruposantander.github.io%2Fdigital-trust-docs%2Fassertions%2Fclaim-assertions-00.html%23name-example&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7C8856a60f31f142f0399508d8292c9f9c%7C72f988bf8</a>6f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304618921838596&amp;sdata=NBWdWBbcwRiE6v1ay%2FjbQG8U36MHs8O8m0tauiZnVHw%3D&amp;reserved=0

It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a capabilities negotiation section with "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from universal identifiers like "<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fschema.bigbankstandards.com%2Foperators%2Fgt&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7C8856a60f31f142f0399508d8292c9f9c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304618921838596&amp;amp">https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fschema.bigbankstandards.com%2Foperators%2Fgt&amp;data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Buchner%40microsoft.com%7C8856a60f31f142f0399508d8292c9f9c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637304618921838596&amp;</a>;sdata=KubWXoHDWMzF6FoNfxrLn4cXLoyCotwBJFrWjOW7bho%3D&amp;reserved=0". These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than recreating JSON Schema.

&gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

         Hey Dan, just some initial thoughts here after a brief review of the spec.

In the following example, it seems that the spec allows for certain semantic/industry-specific comparison using the "gt" operator on strings, which would be not possible in JSON Schema:

It's pretty common in the financial sector to represent currencies as strings as prevent unintentional IEEE 754 mantissa-bending from getting settlements wrong and sending everyone to jail. There is also a capabilities negotiation section with "assertion_claims_query_language_supported" that may benefit from universal identifiers like "<a href="https://schema.bigbankstandards.com/operators/gt">https://schema.bigbankstandards.com/operators/gt</a>". These semantics might be different enough to target a goal other than recreating JSON Schema.

&gt; Thanks for your message, Kristina! Directly adding Brent + Dan + Dave + Tobias here, whom I believe have been working on related efforts in this problem space across Aries, DIF, and CCG. I hope there's an opportunity consolidate efforts.

For example for the alcohol purchase age, in the US it is ageOver18, but in Japan it is ageOver20. The concept of expression language would allow to express this as {"age" : { "gt" : "18", "lt" : "20" } } where gt is 'greater than' and 'lt' is less than.

 Lisa, 
  
 
 Thanks for sharing 
  
 
The concept of community design is very similar to Daniel Rosenberg (MIT PhD in Architecture) concept of Transformational Design:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms7RUjZcREo 
  
 
 Daniel’s done extensive research into the anthropological aspects of design through the intrinsic feedback loops between an architect/designer and people or tools users.

 Would be great to see these forces come together. 
 <br>
 
 Another reaction I had was this could be considered “decentralized design” and not in the sense that the outcome or system being built is decentralized; but fundamentally design by a decentralized process. 
 <br>
 
 Food for thought.

<p>Verifiable credentials are a kind of signed, tamper-proof digital document that uses cryptography to strongly authenticate the information shared between participants. There are many design and behavioral considerations when building systems for digital information-sharing which affect the privacy and security guarantees between the parties which will exchange data. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Eliminating traceability vectors from data exchanged between participants.  Enabling participants to share only subsets or minimized derivatives of the data a signed credential contains, at the same level of assurance as the whole credential.  Ensuring that routine status checks or revocation mechanisms do not leak information about how often, where, or when credentials have been presented.  <p>One way to limit excess information-sharing and preserve privacy throughout the lifecycle of that information’s usage is a set of cryptographic tools known as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs allow participants to account for the issues listed above using cryptographic schemes that cut off tracking vectors, enable granular capabilities for minimizing the subset of data disclosed, and ensure that the usage of credentials does not leave data trails that third parties can monitor and leverage to compromise user privacy individually or en&nbsp;masse.</p>Photo credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZsFXXsv5Qi4">Larry&nbsp;Costales</a> Alignment and Standardization <p>There are many ZKP schemes that have been developed over the years and that can already be used in decentralized identity systems, but few that have seen widespread adoption in production systems.

&gt; Daniel Hardman: My audio says "you are currently the only person 
&gt;   in this conference" -- must have wrong dialin?
&gt; Heather Vescent: Dial in numbers are:   US phone: 
&gt;   <a>tel:+1.540.274.1034;6306</a>    EU phone: <a>tel:+33.9.74.59.31.06;6306</a>
&gt; Daniel Hardman: I figured out my audio problem. All good.
&gt; Darrell Duane: Darrell here (and just dialed in)
&gt; Dave Longley: Scribe+
&gt; Heather Vescent: Yay Dlongley!
&gt; Dave Longley is scribing.
&gt; 
&gt; Topic: Introductions and reintroductions
&gt; 
&gt; Darrell Duane:  Darrell here, heather asked me to come do the 
&gt;   digital wallet discussion.
&gt; Tony: This is my first call.
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy: That's phil-T3 speaking
&gt; Phil Archer:  I've been participating in the other wallet 
&gt;   discussions and am new to the group.
&gt; Isaac Patka: Hi all, Isaac Patka from Bloom. Here to listen in on 
&gt;   wallet discussion as we're working on an interop project
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Hello, this is Daniel Hardman.
&gt; Jantine Derksen: Hi, Jantinehere from Berlin, just figuring out 
&gt;   how to join the audio
&gt; 
&gt; Topic: Announcements and Reminders
&gt;

&gt; Juan Caballero: ^Link to interop session tomorrow
&gt; Adrian Gropper:  Next Wed 21st of July, Kantara will have a 
&gt;   Webinar about UMA in healthcare.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Any other announcements?
&gt; 
&gt; Topic: Progress on Action Items
&gt; 
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
&gt;   <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143</a>
&gt; Orie Steele: +1 To merging the vc http apis.... so we can make 
&gt;   progress...
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We just have one progress report item -- 
&gt;   merging the VC issuer and verifier HTTP APIs. This was discussed 
&gt;   on a call a while back and we're just now getting to it. There 
&gt;   were work items tracking two different APIs, issuer/verifier.
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There was support among the owners for those 
&gt;   items to merge them into a new repo. We're just following up on 
&gt;   that. I emailed the descriptions -- we're going to create a new 
&gt;   repo, combine the existing issuer/verifier APIs into that.
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We have a new baseline spec to update the 
&gt;   content to so that will be the new basis for any subsequent 
&gt;   discussion. So the work item isn't finished, there's just a new 
&gt;   baseline to do edits on.
&gt; Manu Sporny: +1 To merging -- been waiting for that to happen for 
&gt;   a while
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We'll update the CCG work item page to merge 
&gt;   the items.
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  This is non-controversial, owners in 
&gt;   agreement, just calling it out unless there are any objections.
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Add yourself to the queue if you have an 
&gt;   objection.
&gt; 
&gt; Topic: Round table for what's in the wallet part 2.
&gt; 
&gt; Wayne Chang: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Setting informal rules -- so we can have more 
&gt;   effective communication. We've collected some resources at the 
&gt;   link in IRC.
&gt; Adrian Gropper: Kantara Webinar on UMA in Healthcare 
&gt;   
&gt; <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-webinar-uma-health-info-interop-user-control-registration-form/">https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-webinar-uma-health-info-interop-user-control-registration-form/</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang:  If you've agreed to the above you will follow 
&gt;   community guidelines for behavior, social rules, etc. There are 
&gt;   no set consequences for violating these rules they are just 
&gt;   things to keep in mind so we think about how others feel when we 
&gt;   communicate.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  These are typically logical/technical discussions 
&gt;   but still important to make sure we don't accidentally tear 
&gt;   people down, etc. "No actually" that corrects a minor point that 
&gt;   isn't the main point or isn't that relevant to the conversation 
&gt;   ...
&gt; Wayne Chang:  If you say "Oh, you didn't know about this thing?" 
&gt;   That's not productive either and alienating for people who are 
&gt;   trying to learn, etc.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  No back seat driving, if two people are having a 
&gt;   discussion here, we use the queue to avoid this usually, but 
&gt;   don't chime in without using the queue/don't interrupt.
&gt; Orie Steele: Can we just link directly to the code of conduct, so 
&gt;   people can read it on their own time / from the meeting minutes?
&gt; Balázs Némethi: Wayne, CCG, DIF has worked a lot on a Code of 
&gt;   Conduct that is under OS licenses to use by other orgs.
&gt; Balázs Némethi: 
&gt;   
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Don't say things like "windows is so easy to use, 
&gt;   your mom can use it" -- Moms are tech savvy -- Moms are people 
&gt;   too! Don't stereotype and stereotypes can be quite wrong.
&gt; Heather Vescent: @Orie_ and 
&gt;   <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140</a>
&gt; Balázs Némethi: We would be very happy if CCG would consider 
&gt;   taking a deeper look at it
&gt; Dan Burnett: W3C also has a code of conduct 
&gt;   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/PWETF/">https://w3c.github.io/PWETF/</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang: If you are not speaking, please mute! thanks
&gt; Kaliya Young:  This is primarily the work we did in the group for 
&gt;   while. We took 27 responses and sorted them, we found a range of 
&gt;   meaning that people had in their definitions. For wallets 
&gt;   specifically, 12 of the definitions highlighted that it was about 
&gt;   key/secret storage.
&gt; Kaliya Young:  Next most common was that they stored credentials, 
&gt;   next highest was that they aided with agent control.
&gt; Juan Caballero: I believe this is the slide deck, not sure if 
&gt;   it's the newest version tho:
&gt; Juan Caballero: 
&gt;   
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gIEPmbtLNVuaHxdawGBe6ZwFqP43m7iqmIEeUUm3sjI/edit#slide=id.g752184a474_0_4">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gIEPmbtLNVuaHxdawGBe6ZwFqP43m7iqmIEeUUm3sjI/edit#slide=id.g752184a474_0_4</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang: Nice
&gt; Kaliya Young:  Facilitated storing keys/secrets/vcs often 
&gt;   controlled by an agent. The meaning that folks had in between ...
&gt; Lost identitywoman's audio for a minute there.
&gt; Kaliya Young:  Agents may have wallets, agents let you work with 
&gt;   and connect to wallets and agents support delegation and back up 
&gt;   wallets.
&gt; Kaliya Young:  This definition that we came up with about wallets 
&gt;   feels good.
&gt; Juan Caballero: Rage-
&gt; Orie Steele: 
&gt;   <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet</a>
&gt; Orie Steele:  My summary is going to be something... I will talk 
&gt;   about things I presented here in the hyperledger identity group 
&gt;   and aries call. We proposed a universal wallet spec work item. It 
&gt;   attempts to describe what's in wallets. My five minutes will be 
&gt;   on that and what people organize and store in wallets today.
&gt; Orie Steele:  It links to existing specs in the wild, VC, DID 
&gt;   specs, etc. We've seen in the hyperledger community, schemas, 
&gt;   connections, pairwise connectors, people think about payments and 
&gt;   fiat currency or other cryptocurrency/token wallets.
&gt; Orie Steele:  Bitcoin wallets, that sort of thing. What we've 
&gt;   tried to do with this universal wallet spec is to describe the 
&gt;   way people are using wallets.
&gt; Orie Steele:  You can think of it by analogy with what's in your 
&gt;   physical wallet today. Maybe a few dollars or none or some other 
&gt;   currency. Identity documents, coupons, maybe specific types of 
&gt;   credentials like healthcare/insurance cards.
&gt; Orie Steele:  Other things related to your family might be in 
&gt;   there.
&gt; Orie Steele:  I learned this from SICPA, hopefully they can share 
&gt;   on a future call. People share sensitive things in their wallets 
&gt;   that aren't necessarily credential stuff.
&gt; Orie Steele: 
&gt;   <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/nfc-dids-6d56fda45831">https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/nfc-dids-6d56fda45831</a>
&gt; Orie Steele:  But here, it's relationships with crypto keys, 
&gt;   secrets, VCs, so on.
&gt; Orie Steele:  We have a blog post about our work with the Tangem 
&gt;   cards.
&gt; Orie Steele:  It's about transferring VCs with hardware backed 
&gt;   cards over NFC, etc. Sometimes the key material doesn't exist in 
&gt;   the wallet itself.
&gt; Orie Steele:  Tangem provides a hardware based key -- sometimes 
&gt;   you can port keys from one wallet to another and still issue VCs 
&gt;   by using those cards. PIV cards, etc. physical cards people store 
&gt;   in their wallet and you can move meta data about key materials 
&gt;   without having to move the key material itself.
&gt; Orie Steele:  There are also Yubikeys, other key/web mechanisms, 
&gt;   Amazon key management software, there are ways to manage keys 
&gt;   where the key material isn't in the wallet itself.
&gt; Orie Steele:  The point of this spec is to describe what people 
&gt;   are doing and to provide data models for portability.
&gt; Orie Steele:  And to describe a set of interfaces for questions 
&gt;   like: If I move from Wallet A to Wallet B, will I still be able 
&gt;   to use these things in my Wallet A?
&gt; Orie Steele:  I yield back the remainder of my time.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  We're working on a better infrastructure for 
&gt;   meetings this summer.
&gt; Daniel Hardman: Here are the slides that I'm going to talk to: 
&gt;   <a href="https://j.mp/3e4HuAw">https://j.mp/3e4HuAw</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Daniel Hardman is up next.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Slide link is in IRC, 5 slides.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  The basic message is that I feel like a wallet 
&gt;   is an intersection of design tension. Physical wallets aren't a 
&gt;   great multipurpose container, can put some things in it, not 
&gt;   others.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  You can put a physical key in there, but lots 
&gt;   isn't great. We don't expect a wallet to contain all of our 
&gt;   assets, or our transaction history, or our bank account. It's 
&gt;   still not uncommon to see wallets that are stuffed.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  I think that's because wallets are super 
&gt;   convenient and it's tempting to use them.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  I'm here to admit the fuzziness, not to provide 
&gt;   a definition.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  There are two graphs ... about sensitivity of 
&gt;   data. Different degrees of sensitivity for the data and the 
&gt;   stakes for exposing the data is different.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Other graphic is about data size and richness.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Two axes, two dimensional view, I'm claiming 
&gt;   data that is highly rich and very large, a genome is an extreme 
&gt;   example there. On the other extreme there is super small and not 
&gt;   very rich like a cryptographic key.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  There are also all types of data related to SSI. 
&gt;   There's more than 14 obviously, but these are interesting for 
&gt;   test cases.
&gt; Orie Steele: Great question regarding presentations
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Would we put a biometric template in a wallet, I 
&gt;   don't know, would presentations from others go in wallet, I don't 
&gt;   know. Maybe things at the bottom of the list don't go in a 
&gt;   wallet, it's debatable.
&gt; Anil John: Given all the good discussions &amp; materials on Digital 
&gt;   Wallets that is happening at the CCG, it would be good if there 
&gt;   was landing page off <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/</a> 
&gt;   that aggregates and provides pointers to all of this goodness!
&gt; Nader Helmy: Feels like health records would fall under “held 
&gt;   credentials”
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  The next slide is making the point that wallets 
&gt;   and remoteness is interesting ... some secrets can be remote and 
&gt;   others can't. You must have a secret that unlocks the remoteness.
&gt; Orie Steele: These slides are really great... this is excellent
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  One of these characteristics is that the wallet 
&gt;   is local. It could be in a database off of the current machine, 
&gt;   that's not what I mean by local, you can access it without extra 
&gt;   work is more like what I mean.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  A wallet is not just a mobile app, there could 
&gt;   be paper versions of wallets. A wallet is a locus of control in 
&gt;   the "DID controller" sense. There's a complicated relationship in 
&gt;   that sense, there's an interesting nexus there.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Please wrap up, thank you! [scribe assist by 
&gt;   Wayne Chang]
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Backup and replication are there. Replicating 
&gt;   wallets is interesting because never copying private keys may 
&gt;   cause some differences. Wallets may be subdivided by work vs. 
&gt;   personal or by identities like parents vs. children.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  A wallet is certainly a hacking target.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  The last observation on this slide is that a 
&gt;   wallet is not necessarily in a containment relationship with all 
&gt;   the things it's associated with -- it may just reference data 
&gt;   that it doesn't contain in the most literal sense.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  "What's *in* a wallet" the word "in" is worth 
&gt;   thinking about.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  My sixth slide is where I wanted to end up so go 
&gt;   look at it.
&gt; Darrell Duane: Darrell's deck - 
&gt;   
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shW4GzjG0HE2uxLCcYdSkaG-nCRBVZrwRFpa8Gs709U/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shW4GzjG0HE2uxLCcYdSkaG-nCRBVZrwRFpa8Gs709U/edit?usp=sharing</a>
&gt; Orie Steele: Yes, the last slide is critical... its about how 
&gt;   wallets relate to other ecosystem components like hubs and 
&gt;   vaults.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  I'm going to be talking about a report we pushed 
&gt;   out last year. Created for two reasons, address concerns over 
&gt;   ambiguity of what a digital wallet is. One report is a public 
&gt;   report -- link in the chat. Another is a business strategy 
&gt;   report.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  There was a lot of handwaving that wallets mean a 
&gt;   lot of different things to different people. "Oh the wallet will 
&gt;   do that" is too much handwaving.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  We went over ~300 projects, lots of discussion. 
&gt;   Deep dived, we covered "what are the capabilities of a wallet", 
&gt;   from a user/enterprise perspective not a dev one.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  What stuff do we put in a wallet, enterprise 
&gt;   specific concerns, multiperson/organization concerns. 
&gt;   Cryptocurrencies vs. layman's term for a wallet. We covered the 
&gt;   state of tech as of March 2019.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  Lots of progress in some areas and not so much in 
&gt;   others.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  We identified immediately the user experience is 
&gt;   the biggest problem.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  Update on what we've learned since. The wallets 
&gt;   in the wild and being used by non-techies -- people just using 
&gt;   apps to do their work. These are single credential/single 
&gt;   connection types of apps. I've been at an advising role at 
&gt;   CULedger -- most apps have been single credential, etc. These 
&gt;   have been dead simple use cases.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  Other key thing that Daniel hit on -- 
&gt;   backup/recovery is terrifying on a mere mortal basis. It's an 
&gt;   attack vector. It's a surprise to credit unions and banks, can 
&gt;   people operate on two phones, can someone else take my phone and 
&gt;   bank on my behalf and rip me off, etc.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  Lots of crypto/tech centric...
&gt; Darrell Duane:  If you want to get access to report, hit me up on 
&gt;   twitter and I'll link in the chat. Doc is almost 90 pages long.
&gt; Darrell Duane:  One of the funders wanted a summary but that 
&gt;   would be 3x-4x the actual doc.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  On to Katryna.
&gt; Darrell Duane: Direct link to the wallet report: 
&gt;   
&gt; <a href="https://thewalletwars.s3.amazonaws.com/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf">https://thewalletwars.s3.amazonaws.com/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf</a>
&gt; Wayne Chang:  On to Charles, Katryna has audio trouble.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: I work for an SSI company in Berlin Germany.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: I work for Jolocom.
&gt; Joachim Lohkamp: 
&gt;   
&gt; <a href="https://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jolocom-WhatisinaWallet-CCG-W3C.pdf">https://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jolocom-WhatisinaWallet-CCG-W3C.pdf</a>
&gt; Charles_cunningham: We have looked extensively at what goes in a 
&gt;   wallet for sometime. We offer a wallet as an app on iOS, etc. We 
&gt;   have a wallet for enterprise use cases but slightly less 
&gt;   sophisticated.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: We have some simple graphics for what we 
&gt;   think goes in a wallet.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: Key material. Everyone knows key material is 
&gt;   the foundation for all wallets -- the simplest definition is a 
&gt;   wallet manages that key material for you.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: Managing keys is fine for a cryptocurrency 
&gt;   wallet. Obviously credentials go right into a wallet. The analogy 
&gt;   is right there with physical wallets like driver's licenses.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: Capabilities, similar to credentials. They 
&gt;   can present signed data. In the UI for our wallets, we've 
&gt;   separated the representations.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: More in particular it's about authorization. 
&gt;   Credentials are more about presenting information about yourself.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: History and metadata. They are closely 
&gt;   related and represented in our wallets. If I'm being issued a 
&gt;   credential our issuance protocol finds a way to indicate how to 
&gt;   display the credential in the wallet.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: This metadata and the history includes all of 
&gt;   the interactions with other identities. This includes pairwise 
&gt;   identities, IDs for the credentials exchanged, so on.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: In a functional sense, wallets can be defined 
&gt;   as stores of sensitive information. But they can also be modeled 
&gt;   as agents. Presenting a credential to someone or participating in 
&gt;   some kind of interaction.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: We've included non-credential based 
&gt;   interactions, using the keys in your wallet ... looking for ways 
&gt;   to mix personal version vs. enterprise version. We've been 
&gt;   exploring this through a capabilities model.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: How an individual might interact with a 
&gt;   larger entity through capabilities.
&gt; Charles_cunningham: Through key operations.
&gt; Darrell Duane: Dang - I've lost my phone connection here.
&gt; Juan Caballero: @Joachim was there a second link/page?
&gt; Charles_cunningham: We have an image on our SDK ... we use a 
&gt;   wallet for both mobile and server side ... simple interfaces to 
&gt;   give it the full functionality.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Katryna is up next.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  We welcome you to give a brief intro and answer 
&gt;   what's in a wallet.
&gt; Katryna: My name is Katryna Dow, founder of Meeco.
&gt; Katryna: This is all valid and interesting, but taking a slightly 
&gt;   different direction.
&gt; Katryna: Starting in this space over a decade ago. Data and 
&gt;   information that was important... working backwards from that 
&gt;   over the last few years. It's really interesting the way language 
&gt;   shapes tech.
&gt; Katryna: From the evolution of our products and services, we've 
&gt;   moved from something ... we've moved from saying all the things 
&gt;   about yourself over your life to categorizing it, to having a 
&gt;   consent layer, to having an API to connect.
&gt; Katryna: The evolution of that comes down to portability. How 
&gt;   things become light weight. The thing that's emerging in 
&gt;   listening to everyone. The idea of portable, reusability. Real 
&gt;   digital transformation vs. digitization. We've been through a 
&gt;   decade or so with taking data and information and digitizing it.
&gt; Katryna: The wallet can focus on things that are really critical 
&gt;   and light weight that you want with you in an everyday sense. And 
&gt;   then move to the digitally connected world vs. just mirroring the 
&gt;   physical world.
&gt; Katryna: Wallets also allow ecosystems to develop quickly without 
&gt;   a need for tight integration.
&gt; Katryna: The standards group that many of us are part of ... 
&gt;   interop and portability mean that ecosystems can develop quickly 
&gt;   with the individual, service provider, and trust anchor that can 
&gt;   be universally recognized.
&gt; Katryna: From our perspective, all the things we've been 
&gt;   building, uni transcript, health provider, etc. -- these things 
&gt;   are becoming more important anchor points around things that are 
&gt;   more light weight and used every day.
&gt; Katryna: The language and evolution from data storage to 
&gt;   connectivity and integration ... now down to the use of the term 
&gt;   "wallet" ... it helps give people an understanding around how 
&gt;   those things might fit into everyday life.
&gt; Katryna: Also, how do you bring this lightweight decentralized 
&gt;   human solution into the enterprise world. We've been doing 
&gt;   interesting work around OIDC around infrastructure and emerging 
&gt;   infrastructure.
&gt; Katryna: To allow people to be free and independent but also come 
&gt;   into an ecosystem and help with B2B value.
&gt; Katryna: The evolution is interesting to me and how the language 
&gt;   has helped shape the tech and create the clarity that Kaliya 
&gt;   talked about earlier on.
&gt; Orie Steele: What organization is Katryna with again?
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Feel free to email the admins as needed if you have 
&gt;   any concerns.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Nathan, thanks for stepping in at the last minute, 
&gt;   please give a brief intro and your answer to what's in a wallet.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Nathan with Learning Economy Foundation.
&gt; Nathan-lef: We have been collaborating with gov't for running 
&gt;   pilots.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Digital wallets, enabling true ownership of education 
&gt;   credentials.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Working on an initiative ... the open wallet 
&gt;   architecture.
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/4/d/e/2PACX-1vR6GMNrBzDuMvhHGlVeENEMZjijHTVKUueG5f6KshFlsIfcqt1QjsTGNgB8vjEGfDVFRB-dWhe5-Hxc/pub">https://docs.google.com/document/u/4/d/e/2PACX-1vR6GMNrBzDuMvhHGlVeENEMZjijHTVKUueG5f6KshFlsIfcqt1QjsTGNgB8vjEGfDVFRB-dWhe5-Hxc/pub</a>
&gt; Nathan-lef: We're in the initial stages of this. Working on 
&gt;   defining it and collecting data.
&gt; Nathan-lef: What's a wallet: Very high level. A wallet is an 
&gt;   abstraction that represents everything that's important enough 
&gt;   for things to be stored in it.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Focusing on how digital data is stored, not 
&gt;   specifically what -- so working with arbitrary storage.
&gt; Nathan-lef: We want to leverage the existing ecosystem and 
&gt;   looking at current solutions and  requirements so as not to 
&gt;   preclude anything.
&gt; Nathan-lef: We are calling on these use cases for the wallet 
&gt;   domains.
&gt; Nathan-lef: We want to ensure that the value of the wallet 
&gt;   appreciates over time. Tremendous value -- in interop and 
&gt;   portability.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Discussions have been there and we want to build on 
&gt;   top of that. We want to see that through setting standards for 
&gt;   more mass adoption from customer perspective.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Application and hardware agnostic -- not tied to any 
&gt;   particular user experience. Perhaps counter to some -- we want to 
&gt;   imagine the wallet being everywhere at once. Supporting remote 
&gt;   storage, hierarchies, supporting offline too with balance.
&gt; Nathan-lef: We are in agreement with most everything we've seen 
&gt;   through these presenters today and last week. We want to 
&gt;   emphasize things that might not have been before. The wallet is 
&gt;   not tied to an application.
&gt; Nathan-lef: That lets apps get some view into the wallet but the 
&gt;   customer is dealing with one wallet.
&gt; Nathan-lef: The wallet itself does not define data boundaries, 
&gt;   but has pluggable functional components for all use cases whether 
&gt;   that's local or remote storage.
&gt; Nathan-lef: Focus on VCs, etc.
&gt; Nathan-lef: From the existing ecosystem from hyperledger to 
&gt;   universal wallet, we see what's needed right now. I want to 
&gt;   encourage anyone who wants to help with this initiative to reach 
&gt;   out. We are trying to be as open and inclusive as possible and 
&gt;   want to synthesize all these efforts.

&gt; Wayne Chang:  Thanks for your contribution.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  We will move to Q&amp;A now -- please keep things to 
&gt;   about 30 seconds.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Up to two of the people would have 30 seconds to 
&gt;   queue and answer or comment.
&gt; Christopher Allen: Wyoming Private Key Disclosure Bill "No person 
&gt;   shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key 
&gt;   known to any other person in any civil, administrative, 
&gt;   legislative or other proceeding in this state that only relates 
&gt;   to a digital security or virtual currency to which the private 
&gt;   key provides access.  This paragraph shall not be interpreted to 
&gt;   prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce 
&gt;   or disclose a
&gt; Christopher Allen: Digital security or virtual currency to which 
&gt;   a private key provides access, or to disclose information about 
&gt;   the digital security or virtual currency, provided that the 
&gt;   proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the 
&gt;   private key." <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2020/HB0041">https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2020/HB0041</a>
&gt; Christopher Allen:  One lense -- focus/direction -- that seems to 
&gt;   be missing from our models is from a legal perspective.
&gt; Christopher Allen:  I'll share a link in IRC, it's a bill that I 
&gt;   helped propose in Wyoming to help protect your private keys. 
&gt;   There's an assumption that they are yours, they can't be 
&gt;   compelled from you.
&gt; Christopher Allen:  I'd like to ask the wallet arch people -- 
&gt;   have you looked at the line where it's "yours" and where other 
&gt;   things are maybe not totally "yours".
&gt; Christopher Allen:  It stops being a wallet perhaps when people 
&gt;   can pull from it.
&gt; Manu Sporny:  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144</a> 
&gt;   [scribe assist by Wayne Chang]
&gt; Wayne Chang: Just opened this
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  I think that's fascinating and important. And 
&gt;   where you put the presentations you receive from others -- you 
&gt;   may be receiving a moral/legal responsibility to safeguard the 
&gt;   data.
&gt; Daniel Hardman:  Other entanglements there, I agree.
&gt; Adrian Gropper:  I want to say that I ascribe closest to Daniel 
&gt;   Hardman's presentation and say that we've been lax in what's an 
&gt;   agent and what's a wallet since the beginning. My definition of 
&gt;   what's a wallet is what can't be done by an agent. 
&gt;   Non-repudiation tied to biometrics and what's useful offline.
&gt; Juan Caballero: +100
&gt; Heather Vescent: Already planning to do that Manu. :-)
&gt; Curate+++
&gt; Juan Caballero: Rage-
&gt; Manu Sporny:  I just wanted to highlight a comment that Anil John 
&gt;   made earlier. It would be great if we could curate these 
&gt;   conversations and we have great perspectives on what a wallet is. 
&gt;   Next step could be driving towards consensus in the community on 
&gt;   what these things are and being able to link to them from the 
&gt;   landing page of the CG would be great.
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Great. I just opened a github issue towards exactly 
&gt;   this. It's wonderful idea, people drop a note in that github 
&gt;   issue to help contribute.
&gt; Daniel Hardman: Which repo is the github issue in?
&gt; Wayne Chang: Github.com/w3c-ccg/community
&gt; Wayne Chang: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144</a>
&gt; Ryan Grant:  Thanks for all these presentations. What I want from 
&gt;   a wallet standard is a way to understand if my wallet 
&gt;   successfully accepts all the things it needs to and can generate 
&gt;   all the things that your wallet may need to accept so we can 
&gt;   complete whatever our thing is.
&gt; Jonathan Holt:  There is a difference perhaps between what is my 
&gt;   wallet that I use and what is a commercial wallet that is being 
&gt;   vendored.
&gt; Juan Caballero: +1
&gt; Wayne Chang:  Thanks for our great speakers!
&gt; Juan Caballero: Huge thanks to all the great presenters!
&gt; Dave Longley:  You did an amazing job with the notes, we are 
&gt;   eternally grateful [scribe assist by Wayne Chang]
&gt; Wayne Chang: Sorry i ran out of time to give a thanks
&gt; Heather Vescent: +1 Dlongley!

Daniel Hardman: My audio says "you are currently the only person 
  in this conference" -- must have wrong dialin?
Heather Vescent: Dial in numbers are:   US phone: 
  <a>tel:+1.540.274.1034;6306</a>    EU phone: <a>tel:+33.9.74.59.31.06;6306</a>
Daniel Hardman: I figured out my audio problem. All good.
Darrell Duane: Darrell here (and just dialed in)
Dave Longley: Scribe+
Heather Vescent: Yay Dlongley!
Dave Longley is scribing.

Topic: Introductions and reintroductions

Darrell Duane:  Darrell here, heather asked me to come do the 
  digital wallet discussion.
Tony: This is my first call.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: That's phil-T3 speaking
Phil Archer:  I've been participating in the other wallet 
  discussions and am new to the group.
Isaac Patka: Hi all, Isaac Patka from Bloom. Here to listen in on 
  wallet discussion as we're working on an interop project
Daniel Hardman:  Hello, this is Daniel Hardman.
Jantine Derksen: Hi, Jantinehere from Berlin, just figuring out 
  how to join the audio

Topic: Announcements and Reminders

Juan Caballero: <a href="http://bit.ly/DIF-interop-kickoff">http://bit.ly/DIF-interop-kickoff</a>
Juan Caballero: ^Link to interop session tomorrow
Adrian Gropper:  Next Wed 21st of July, Kantara will have a 
  Webinar about UMA in healthcare.
Wayne Chang:  Any other announcements?

Topic: Progress on Action Items

Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/143</a>
Orie Steele: +1 To merging the vc http apis.... so we can make 
  progress...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We just have one progress report item -- 
  merging the VC issuer and verifier HTTP APIs. This was discussed 
  on a call a while back and we're just now getting to it. There 
  were work items tracking two different APIs, issuer/verifier.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There was support among the owners for those 
  items to merge them into a new repo. We're just following up on 
  that. I emailed the descriptions -- we're going to create a new 
  repo, combine the existing issuer/verifier APIs into that.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We have a new baseline spec to update the 
  content to so that will be the new basis for any subsequent 
  discussion. So the work item isn't finished, there's just a new 
  baseline to do edits on.
Manu Sporny: +1 To merging -- been waiting for that to happen for 
  a while
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We'll update the CCG work item page to merge 
  the items.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  This is non-controversial, owners in 
  agreement, just calling it out unless there are any objections.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Add yourself to the queue if you have an 
  objection.

Topic: Round table for what's in the wallet part 2.

Wayne Chang: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140</a>
Wayne Chang:  Setting informal rules -- so we can have more 
  effective communication. We've collected some resources at the 
  link in IRC.
Adrian Gropper: Kantara Webinar on UMA in Healthcare 
  <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-webinar-uma-health-info-interop-user-control-registration-form/">https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-webinar-uma-health-info-interop-user-control-registration-form/</a>
Wayne Chang:  If you've agreed to the above you will follow 
  community guidelines for behavior, social rules, etc. There are 
  no set consequences for violating these rules they are just 
  things to keep in mind so we think about how others feel when we 
  communicate.
Wayne Chang:  These are typically logical/technical discussions 
  but still important to make sure we don't accidentally tear 
  people down, etc. "No actually" that corrects a minor point that 
  isn't the main point or isn't that relevant to the conversation 
  ...
Wayne Chang:  If you say "Oh, you didn't know about this thing?" 
  That's not productive either and alienating for people who are 
  trying to learn, etc.
Wayne Chang:  No back seat driving, if two people are having a 
  discussion here, we use the queue to avoid this usually, but 
  don't chime in without using the queue/don't interrupt.
Orie Steele: Can we just link directly to the code of conduct, so 
  people can read it on their own time / from the meeting minutes?
Balázs Némethi: Wayne, CCG, DIF has worked a lot on a Code of 
  Conduct that is under OS licenses to use by other orgs.
Balázs Némethi: 
  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>
Wayne Chang:  Don't say things like "windows is so easy to use, 
  your mom can use it" -- Moms are tech savvy -- Moms are people 
  too! Don't stereotype and stereotypes can be quite wrong.
Heather Vescent: @Orie_ and 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140</a>
Balázs Némethi: We would be very happy if CCG would consider 
  taking a deeper look at it
Dan Burnett: W3C also has a code of conduct 
  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/PWETF/">https://w3c.github.io/PWETF/</a>
Wayne Chang: If you are not speaking, please mute! thanks
Kaliya Young:  This is primarily the work we did in the group for 
  while. We took 27 responses and sorted them, we found a range of 
  meaning that people had in their definitions. For wallets 
  specifically, 12 of the definitions highlighted that it was about 
  key/secret storage.
Kaliya Young:  Next most common was that they stored credentials, 
  next highest was that they aided with agent control.
Juan Caballero: I believe this is the slide deck, not sure if 
  it's the newest version tho:
Juan Caballero: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gIEPmbtLNVuaHxdawGBe6ZwFqP43m7iqmIEeUUm3sjI/edit#slide=id.g752184a474_0_4">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gIEPmbtLNVuaHxdawGBe6ZwFqP43m7iqmIEeUUm3sjI/edit#slide=id.g752184a474_0_4</a>
Wayne Chang: Nice
Kaliya Young:  Facilitated storing keys/secrets/vcs often 
  controlled by an agent. The meaning that folks had in between ...
Lost identitywoman's audio for a minute there.
Kaliya Young:  Agents may have wallets, agents let you work with 
  and connect to wallets and agents support delegation and back up 
  wallets.
Kaliya Young:  This definition that we came up with about wallets 
  feels good.
Juan Caballero: Rage-
Orie Steele: 
  <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet</a>
Orie Steele:  My summary is going to be something... I will talk 
  about things I presented here in the hyperledger identity group 
  and aries call. We proposed a universal wallet spec work item. It 
  attempts to describe what's in wallets. My five minutes will be 
  on that and what people organize and store in wallets today.
Orie Steele:  It links to existing specs in the wild, VC, DID 
  specs, etc. We've seen in the hyperledger community, schemas, 
  connections, pairwise connectors, people think about payments and 
  fiat currency or other cryptocurrency/token wallets.
Orie Steele:  Bitcoin wallets, that sort of thing. What we've 
  tried to do with this universal wallet spec is to describe the 
  way people are using wallets.
Orie Steele:  You can think of it by analogy with what's in your 
  physical wallet today. Maybe a few dollars or none or some other 
  currency. Identity documents, coupons, maybe specific types of 
  credentials like healthcare/insurance cards.
Orie Steele:  Other things related to your family might be in 
  there.
Orie Steele:  I learned this from SICPA, hopefully they can share 
  on a future call. People share sensitive things in their wallets 
  that aren't necessarily credential stuff.
Orie Steele: 
  <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/nfc-dids-6d56fda45831">https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/nfc-dids-6d56fda45831</a>
Orie Steele:  But here, it's relationships with crypto keys, 
  secrets, VCs, so on.
Orie Steele:  We have a blog post about our work with the Tangem 
  cards.
Orie Steele:  It's about transferring VCs with hardware backed 
  cards over NFC, etc. Sometimes the key material doesn't exist in 
  the wallet itself.
Orie Steele:  Tangem provides a hardware based key -- sometimes 
  you can port keys from one wallet to another and still issue VCs 
  by using those cards. PIV cards, etc. physical cards people store 
  in their wallet and you can move meta data about key materials 
  without having to move the key material itself.
Orie Steele:  There are also Yubikeys, other key/web mechanisms, 
  Amazon key management software, there are ways to manage keys 
  where the key material isn't in the wallet itself.
Orie Steele:  The point of this spec is to describe what people 
  are doing and to provide data models for portability.
Orie Steele:  And to describe a set of interfaces for questions 
  like: If I move from Wallet A to Wallet B, will I still be able 
  to use these things in my Wallet A?
Orie Steele:  I yield back the remainder of my time.
Wayne Chang:  We're working on a better infrastructure for 
  meetings this summer.
Daniel Hardman: Here are the slides that I'm going to talk to: 
  <a href="https://j.mp/3e4HuAw">https://j.mp/3e4HuAw</a>
Wayne Chang:  Daniel Hardman is up next.
Daniel Hardman:  Slide link is in IRC, 5 slides.
Daniel Hardman:  The basic message is that I feel like a wallet 
  is an intersection of design tension. Physical wallets aren't a 
  great multipurpose container, can put some things in it, not 
  others.
Daniel Hardman:  You can put a physical key in there, but lots 
  isn't great. We don't expect a wallet to contain all of our 
  assets, or our transaction history, or our bank account. It's 
  still not uncommon to see wallets that are stuffed.
Daniel Hardman:  I think that's because wallets are super 
  convenient and it's tempting to use them.
Daniel Hardman:  I'm here to admit the fuzziness, not to provide 
  a definition.
Daniel Hardman:  There are two graphs ... about sensitivity of 
  data. Different degrees of sensitivity for the data and the 
  stakes for exposing the data is different.
Daniel Hardman:  Other graphic is about data size and richness.
Daniel Hardman:  Two axes, two dimensional view, I'm claiming 
  data that is highly rich and very large, a genome is an extreme 
  example there. On the other extreme there is super small and not 
  very rich like a cryptographic key.
Daniel Hardman:  There are also all types of data related to SSI. 
  There's more than 14 obviously, but these are interesting for 
  test cases.
Orie Steele: Great question regarding presentations
Daniel Hardman:  Would we put a biometric template in a wallet, I 
  don't know, would presentations from others go in wallet, I don't 
  know. Maybe things at the bottom of the list don't go in a 
  wallet, it's debatable.
Anil John: Given all the good discussions &amp; materials on Digital 
  Wallets that is happening at the CCG, it would be good if there 
  was landing page off <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/</a> 
  that aggregates and provides pointers to all of this goodness!
Nader Helmy: Feels like health records would fall under “held 
  credentials”
Daniel Hardman:  The next slide is making the point that wallets 
  and remoteness is interesting ... some secrets can be remote and 
  others can't. You must have a secret that unlocks the remoteness.
Orie Steele: These slides are really great... this is excellent
Daniel Hardman:  One of these characteristics is that the wallet 
  is local. It could be in a database off of the current machine, 
  that's not what I mean by local, you can access it without extra 
  work is more like what I mean.
Daniel Hardman:  A wallet is not just a mobile app, there could 
  be paper versions of wallets. A wallet is a locus of control in 
  the "DID controller" sense. There's a complicated relationship in 
  that sense, there's an interesting nexus there.
Daniel Hardman:  Please wrap up, thank you! [scribe assist by 
  Wayne Chang]
Daniel Hardman:  Backup and replication are there. Replicating 
  wallets is interesting because never copying private keys may 
  cause some differences. Wallets may be subdivided by work vs. 
  personal or by identities like parents vs. children.
Daniel Hardman:  A wallet is certainly a hacking target.
Daniel Hardman:  The last observation on this slide is that a 
  wallet is not necessarily in a containment relationship with all 
  the things it's associated with -- it may just reference data 
  that it doesn't contain in the most literal sense.
Daniel Hardman:  "What's *in* a wallet" the word "in" is worth 
  thinking about.
Daniel Hardman:  My sixth slide is where I wanted to end up so go 
  look at it.
Darrell Duane: Darrell's deck - 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shW4GzjG0HE2uxLCcYdSkaG-nCRBVZrwRFpa8Gs709U/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shW4GzjG0HE2uxLCcYdSkaG-nCRBVZrwRFpa8Gs709U/edit?usp=sharing</a>
Orie Steele: Yes, the last slide is critical... its about how 
  wallets relate to other ecosystem components like hubs and 
  vaults.
Darrell Duane:  I'm going to be talking about a report we pushed 
  out last year. Created for two reasons, address concerns over 
  ambiguity of what a digital wallet is. One report is a public 
  report -- link in the chat. Another is a business strategy 
  report.
Darrell Duane:  There was a lot of handwaving that wallets mean a 
  lot of different things to different people. "Oh the wallet will 
  do that" is too much handwaving.
Darrell Duane:  We went over ~300 projects, lots of discussion. 
  Deep dived, we covered "what are the capabilities of a wallet", 
  from a user/enterprise perspective not a dev one.
Darrell Duane:  What stuff do we put in a wallet, enterprise 
  specific concerns, multiperson/organization concerns. 
  Cryptocurrencies vs. layman's term for a wallet. We covered the 
  state of tech as of March 2019.
Darrell Duane:  Lots of progress in some areas and not so much in 
  others.
Darrell Duane:  We identified immediately the user experience is 
  the biggest problem.
Darrell Duane:  Update on what we've learned since. The wallets 
  in the wild and being used by non-techies -- people just using 
  apps to do their work. These are single credential/single 
  connection types of apps. I've been at an advising role at 
  CULedger -- most apps have been single credential, etc. These 
  have been dead simple use cases.
Darrell Duane:  Other key thing that Daniel hit on -- 
  backup/recovery is terrifying on a mere mortal basis. It's an 
  attack vector. It's a surprise to credit unions and banks, can 
  people operate on two phones, can someone else take my phone and 
  bank on my behalf and rip me off, etc.
Darrell Duane:  Lots of crypto/tech centric...
Darrell Duane:  If you want to get access to report, hit me up on 
  twitter and I'll link in the chat. Doc is almost 90 pages long.
Darrell Duane:  One of the funders wanted a summary but that 
  would be 3x-4x the actual doc.
Wayne Chang:  On to Katryna.
Darrell Duane: Direct link to the wallet report: 
  <a href="https://thewalletwars.s3.amazonaws.com/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf">https://thewalletwars.s3.amazonaws.com/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf</a>
Wayne Chang:  On to Charles, Katryna has audio trouble.
Charles_cunningham: I work for an SSI company in Berlin Germany.
Charles_cunningham: I work for Jolocom.
Joachim Lohkamp: 
  <a href="https://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jolocom-WhatisinaWallet-CCG-W3C.pdf">https://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jolocom-WhatisinaWallet-CCG-W3C.pdf</a>
Charles_cunningham: We have looked extensively at what goes in a 
  wallet for sometime. We offer a wallet as an app on iOS, etc. We 
  have a wallet for enterprise use cases but slightly less 
  sophisticated.
Charles_cunningham: We have some simple graphics for what we 
  think goes in a wallet.
Charles_cunningham: Key material. Everyone knows key material is 
  the foundation for all wallets -- the simplest definition is a 
  wallet manages that key material for you.
Charles_cunningham: Managing keys is fine for a cryptocurrency 
  wallet. Obviously credentials go right into a wallet. The analogy 
  is right there with physical wallets like driver's licenses.
Charles_cunningham: Capabilities, similar to credentials. They 
  can present signed data. In the UI for our wallets, we've 
  separated the representations.
Charles_cunningham: More in particular it's about authorization. 
  Credentials are more about presenting information about yourself.
Charles_cunningham: History and metadata. They are closely 
  related and represented in our wallets. If I'm being issued a 
  credential our issuance protocol finds a way to indicate how to 
  display the credential in the wallet.
Charles_cunningham: This metadata and the history includes all of 
  the interactions with other identities. This includes pairwise 
  identities, IDs for the credentials exchanged, so on.
Charles_cunningham: In a functional sense, wallets can be defined 
  as stores of sensitive information. But they can also be modeled 
  as agents. Presenting a credential to someone or participating in 
  some kind of interaction.
Charles_cunningham: We've included non-credential based 
  interactions, using the keys in your wallet ... looking for ways 
  to mix personal version vs. enterprise version. We've been 
  exploring this through a capabilities model.
Charles_cunningham: How an individual might interact with a 
  larger entity through capabilities.
Charles_cunningham: Through key operations.
Darrell Duane: Dang - I've lost my phone connection here.
Juan Caballero: @Joachim was there a second link/page?
Charles_cunningham: We have an image on our SDK ... we use a 
  wallet for both mobile and server side ... simple interfaces to 
  give it the full functionality.
Wayne Chang:  Katryna is up next.
Wayne Chang:  We welcome you to give a brief intro and answer 
  what's in a wallet.
Katryna: My name is Katryna Dow, founder of Meeco.
Katryna: This is all valid and interesting, but taking a slightly 
  different direction.
Katryna: Starting in this space over a decade ago. Data and 
  information that was important... working backwards from that 
  over the last few years. It's really interesting the way language 
  shapes tech.
Katryna: From the evolution of our products and services, we've 
  moved from something ... we've moved from saying all the things 
  about yourself over your life to categorizing it, to having a 
  consent layer, to having an API to connect.
Katryna: The evolution of that comes down to portability. How 
  things become light weight. The thing that's emerging in 
  listening to everyone. The idea of portable, reusability. Real 
  digital transformation vs. digitization. We've been through a 
  decade or so with taking data and information and digitizing it.
Katryna: The wallet can focus on things that are really critical 
  and light weight that you want with you in an everyday sense. And 
  then move to the digitally connected world vs. just mirroring the 
  physical world.
Katryna: Wallets also allow ecosystems to develop quickly without 
  a need for tight integration.
Katryna: The standards group that many of us are part of ... 
  interop and portability mean that ecosystems can develop quickly 
  with the individual, service provider, and trust anchor that can 
  be universally recognized.
Katryna: From our perspective, all the things we've been 
  building, uni transcript, health provider, etc. -- these things 
  are becoming more important anchor points around things that are 
  more light weight and used every day.
Katryna: The language and evolution from data storage to 
  connectivity and integration ... now down to the use of the term 
  "wallet" ... it helps give people an understanding around how 
  those things might fit into everyday life.
Katryna: Also, how do you bring this lightweight decentralized 
  human solution into the enterprise world. We've been doing 
  interesting work around OIDC around infrastructure and emerging 
  infrastructure.
Katryna: To allow people to be free and independent but also come 
  into an ecosystem and help with B2B value.
Katryna: The evolution is interesting to me and how the language 
  has helped shape the tech and create the clarity that Kaliya 
  talked about earlier on.
Orie Steele: What organization is Katryna with again?
Wayne Chang:  Feel free to email the admins as needed if you have 
  any concerns.
Wayne Chang:  Nathan, thanks for stepping in at the last minute, 
  please give a brief intro and your answer to what's in a wallet.
Nathan-lef: Nathan with Learning Economy Foundation.
Nathan-lef: We have been collaborating with gov't for running 
  pilots.
Nathan-lef: Digital wallets, enabling true ownership of education 
  credentials.
Nathan-lef: Working on an initiative ... the open wallet 
  architecture.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/4/d/e/2PACX-1vR6GMNrBzDuMvhHGlVeENEMZjijHTVKUueG5f6KshFlsIfcqt1QjsTGNgB8vjEGfDVFRB-dWhe5-Hxc/pub">https://docs.google.com/document/u/4/d/e/2PACX-1vR6GMNrBzDuMvhHGlVeENEMZjijHTVKUueG5f6KshFlsIfcqt1QjsTGNgB8vjEGfDVFRB-dWhe5-Hxc/pub</a>
Nathan-lef: We're in the initial stages of this. Working on 
  defining it and collecting data.
Nathan-lef: What's a wallet: Very high level. A wallet is an 
  abstraction that represents everything that's important enough 
  for things to be stored in it.
Nathan-lef: Focusing on how digital data is stored, not 
  specifically what -- so working with arbitrary storage.
Nathan-lef: We want to leverage the existing ecosystem and 
  looking at current solutions and  requirements so as not to 
  preclude anything.
Nathan-lef: We are calling on these use cases for the wallet 
  domains.
Nathan-lef: We want to ensure that the value of the wallet 
  appreciates over time. Tremendous value -- in interop and 
  portability.
Nathan-lef: Discussions have been there and we want to build on 
  top of that. We want to see that through setting standards for 
  more mass adoption from customer perspective.
Nathan-lef: Application and hardware agnostic -- not tied to any 
  particular user experience. Perhaps counter to some -- we want to 
  imagine the wallet being everywhere at once. Supporting remote 
  storage, hierarchies, supporting offline too with balance.
Nathan-lef: We are in agreement with most everything we've seen 
  through these presenters today and last week. We want to 
  emphasize things that might not have been before. The wallet is 
  not tied to an application.
Nathan-lef: That lets apps get some view into the wallet but the 
  customer is dealing with one wallet.
Nathan-lef: The wallet itself does not define data boundaries, 
  but has pluggable functional components for all use cases whether 
  that's local or remote storage.
Nathan-lef: Focus on VCs, etc.
Nathan-lef: From the existing ecosystem from hyperledger to 
  universal wallet, we see what's needed right now. I want to 
  encourage anyone who wants to help with this initiative to reach 
  out. We are trying to be as open and inclusive as possible and 
  want to synthesize all these efforts.

Wayne Chang:  Thanks for your contribution.
Wayne Chang:  We will move to Q&amp;A now -- please keep things to 
  about 30 seconds.
Wayne Chang:  Up to two of the people would have 30 seconds to 
  queue and answer or comment.
Christopher Allen: Wyoming Private Key Disclosure Bill "No person 
  shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key 
  known to any other person in any civil, administrative, 
  legislative or other proceeding in this state that only relates 
  to a digital security or virtual currency to which the private

  private key." <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2020/HB0041">https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2020/HB0041</a>
Christopher Allen:  One lense -- focus/direction -- that seems to 
  be missing from our models is from a legal perspective.
Christopher Allen:  I'll share a link in IRC, it's a bill that I 
  helped propose in Wyoming to help protect your private keys. 
  There's an assumption that they are yours, they can't be 
  compelled from you.
Christopher Allen:  I'd like to ask the wallet arch people -- 
  have you looked at the line where it's "yours" and where other 
  things are maybe not totally "yours".
Christopher Allen:  It stops being a wallet perhaps when people 
  can pull from it.
Manu Sporny:  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144</a> 
  [scribe assist by Wayne Chang]
Wayne Chang: Just opened this
Daniel Hardman:  I think that's fascinating and important. And 
  where you put the presentations you receive from others -- you 
  may be receiving a moral/legal responsibility to safeguard the 
  data.
Daniel Hardman:  Other entanglements there, I agree.
Adrian Gropper:  I want to say that I ascribe closest to Daniel 
  Hardman's presentation and say that we've been lax in what's an 
  agent and what's a wallet since the beginning. My definition of 
  what's a wallet is what can't be done by an agent. 
  Non-repudiation tied to biometrics and what's useful offline.
Juan Caballero: +100
Heather Vescent: Already planning to do that Manu. :-)
Curate+++
Juan Caballero: Rage-
Manu Sporny:  I just wanted to highlight a comment that Anil John 
  made earlier. It would be great if we could curate these 
  conversations and we have great perspectives on what a wallet is. 
  Next step could be driving towards consensus in the community on 
  what these things are and being able to link to them from the 
  landing page of the CG would be great.
Wayne Chang:  Great. I just opened a github issue towards exactly 
  this. It's wonderful idea, people drop a note in that github 
  issue to help contribute.
Daniel Hardman: Which repo is the github issue in?
Wayne Chang: Github.com/w3c-ccg/community
Wayne Chang: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/144</a>
Ryan Grant:  Thanks for all these presentations. What I want from 
  a wallet standard is a way to understand if my wallet 
  successfully accepts all the things it needs to and can generate 
  all the things that your wallet may need to accept so we can 
  complete whatever our thing is.
Jonathan Holt:  There is a difference perhaps between what is my 
  wallet that I use and what is a commercial wallet that is being 
  vendored.
Juan Caballero: +1
Wayne Chang:  Thanks for our great speakers!
Juan Caballero: Huge thanks to all the great presenters!
Dave Longley:  You did an amazing job with the notes, we are 
  eternally grateful [scribe assist by Wayne Chang]
Wayne Chang: Sorry i ran out of time to give a thanks
Heather Vescent: +1 Dlongley!

&gt;
&gt; Topic: Introductions &amp; Reintroductions
&gt;
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We are moving this meeting to every other
&gt;   week.  will update calendar invites.
&gt;   ... want to move to work item focus in addition to speakers
&gt;   ... want to work on deliverables and still have good slate of
&gt;   speakers
&gt;   ... next meeting in two weeks will talk about Modelling VC
&gt;   document
&gt;
&gt; Topic: Modeling Verifiable Credentials for Education
&gt;
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit</a>
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We want to come up with working examples of
&gt;   VCs.  expressing well known credentials as VC.  using ILR
&gt;   wrapper.  come up with good set of recommendations
&gt;   ... turn over to ILR group
&gt;   ... we recommend standards, incubate
&gt;   ... I will call on Jim Kelly and Nate Otto
&gt;   ... in document two topics
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit#heading=h.pqaju4ey6s0b">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit#heading=h.pqaju4ey6s0b</a>
&gt; .. 1. Xml formatted credentials
&gt;   ... do vc support XML as we thought they would, and does it
&gt;   make more sense to model this in json or json-ld
&gt;   ... json-ld is an RDF serialization and so to can XML. assumed
&gt;   therefore xml was supported, but realize now there is a bit more
&gt;   work and not as straighforward, but is doable.
&gt;   ... could be a solution for any standard expressed as XML to
&gt;   include those in VC.
&gt;   ... if we went the XML path there is some tooling work for
&gt;   supporting signature screens.  we would be adding a new
&gt;   serialization.  total work is small - bookkeeping.
&gt; Jim Kelly:  Pesc board chair and consultatnt
&gt;   ... all in XML like high school transcripts
&gt;   ... see need for move to JSON
&gt; Mano Ramachandran: Guys, do you have any India and UK specific
&gt;   numbers?
&gt;   ... we've been discussing for some time.  we have a json-ld
&gt;   task force in place for 2 or 3 years to discuss including
&gt;   geocode, edxchange
&gt;   ... we have been discussing adding json versions of our xML
&gt;   standards.  xml will not disappear.
&gt; Mano Ramachandran:  Sorry, we don't. But we are overhauling our
&gt;   connection infrastructure and will have something more
&gt;   modern/open by end of summer [scribe assist by Kim Hamilton
&gt;   Duffy]
&gt;   ... not a small feat.  easy to create carbon copies.  easy to
&gt;   create carbon copies in theory,, but not sure that's what the
&gt;   community wants
&gt;   ... Michael sessa is also on the line, and can answer quetions
&gt; Mike Sessa: Good day all...can contact me at
&gt;   <a href="mailto:michael.sessa@pesc.org?Subject=Re%3A%20%5BMINUTES%5D%20W3C%20CCG%20Verifiable%20Credentials%20for%20Education%20Task%20Force%20%20Call%20-%202020-07-13%2012pm%20ET&amp;In-Reply-To=%3CCAFmmOzf-Yf1FuaieYD3NyUryF5Svqu%2BKT441Yeodr83%3DBc3QEQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E&amp;References=%3CCAFmmOzf-Yf1FuaieYD3NyUryF5Svqu%2BKT441Yeodr83%3DBc3QEQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E">michael.sessa@pesc.org</a>
&gt;   ... there are tools that generate json from xml so creating a
&gt;   carbon copy is not difficult.  working on it.  working group is
&gt;   being put together to examine that as a standard
&gt;   ... process to standard creation that requires review and
&gt;   approval.  steps are involved.
&gt;   ... we would be able to add a json version of our pesc
&gt;   standards, but not clear when we could do json=ld
&gt; Driven and developed by PESC Members stepping up (not PESC staff)
&gt;   ... I have begun to realize the value of json=ld for our
&gt;   standards especially as a payload because the payload becomes
&gt;   semantically readable
&gt;   ... is readable as json but more valuable as json-ld
&gt;   ... I know there is a desire to have pesc formats in json but
&gt;   we don't have a timeframe but we are pulling the process to
&gt;   together to build a workgroup and gather the pieces to create a
&gt;   new standard
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The question of json vs json=ld is a good
&gt;   conversation to have in this group
&gt;   ... efforts so far have assumed linked data but that has
&gt;   additional complexity
&gt;   ... Even if we all like it it is still good to document
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json</a>
&gt;   ... Example 1 - course program certificate - this example shows
&gt;   minimal education vc.  if you were designing the minimal thing
&gt;   today that's what it would look like
&gt;   ... nate and I are teeing up discussion in a thread - what
&gt;   terminology do we want to use?  ILR LER?
&gt;   ... how to model open badge as VC, etc.
&gt; Nate Otto:  This issue here is how do we model a claim that a
&gt;   learner has gotten a certificate
&gt;   ... scroll to page 5, working example 1
&gt;   ... shows. a real world certificate and we want to put it in
&gt;   language of VC
&gt;   ... VC allows any claim about someone, e.g., is someone over
&gt;   21, favourite colour is green
&gt;   ... properties asserting about individual
&gt; Nate Otto: See the degree claim:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json#L17">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json#L17</a>
&gt;   ... line 17 - the claim is degree - this subject with DID has
&gt;   degree
&gt;   ... claiming degree is not a common claim
&gt;   ... of all the learning claims in your history very few are
&gt;   degrees
&gt;   ... Is there a common claim type to represent achievement of
&gt;   educational goal
&gt;   ... What is the core concept?
&gt;   ... An achievement level that has criteria and an issuer.  like
&gt;   open badges class - as set of properties - criteria, image,
&gt;   assessed by issuer
&gt; Phil Long: Is the problem Nate is discussing about a defined
&gt;   achievement represents a poverty of structured learning outcomes
&gt;   in the higher ed community?
&gt;   ... What does this mean - open badges calls it a badge - this
&gt;   assertion is about this.  Idea is - 'has achieved'
&gt;   ... Scroll to page 7 - 'holds' means learner holds credential
&gt;   ... A term like hasAchieved should be used.
&gt;   ... Working example 5 is same thing - hasAchieved.  same idea
&gt;   except competency is not necessarily defined by issuer of
&gt;   credential itself.  could be a shared def across issuers
&gt; Allan Third: "HasDemonstrated" seems slightly more general?
&gt;   ... What is this idea of a hasAchieved claim?
&gt;   ... I think it has more power than something like 'degree'
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I agree.  should spend time.
&gt; .. Time to turn to main topic.  People from Open University to
&gt;   talk about their deployment with solid and open badges
&gt;
&gt; Topic: Open University, Solid, and Open Badges
&gt;
&gt; John Domingue:  Joint presentation but colleagues having trouble
&gt;   getting on call.
&gt;   ... Date is important - accreditation is almost like an event.
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy: Voip noise
&gt;   ... Certain credentials have a lifespan.
&gt;   ... Now, to get into talk - going to overview our work at open
&gt;   u.  we have been looking at blockchain accreditation.
&gt;   ... This is a set of highlights of our activities, especially
&gt;   around covid-19
&gt; Phil Long: @John D's comment is important about a date as in most
&gt;   higher ed achievements they are in a defined context based on
&gt;   when they entered a degree pathway. The rules for achievements
&gt;   are bound by the contract at the time of their declared major.
&gt;   ... Slide 1 - there is a URL to our main web site.
&gt; Allan Third:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q8mDa9QjSTirtZxiTVm6p83_6N3rYXKaT_drntzBTrs/">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q8mDa9QjSTirtZxiTVm6p83_6N3rYXKaT_drntzBTrs/</a>
&gt; John Domingue:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q8mDa9QjSTirtZxiTVm6p83_6N3rYXKaT_drntzBTrs/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q8mDa9QjSTirtZxiTVm6p83_6N3rYXKaT_drntzBTrs/edit?usp=sharing</a>
&gt;   ... Slide 2 - overview of content
&gt;   ... We have a strong belief in social justice.  'open' means
&gt;   you don't need any existing quals.
&gt;   ... Some students have studied for a decade.  Something like
&gt;   20K disabled.
&gt;   ... Slide 3 - teaching at scale
&gt;   ... We have a Free learning platform
&gt; Phil Long: If you are not speaking (e.g., typing) please mute
&gt;   your mic.
&gt;   ... we founded a mooc with 10 million registered learners.
&gt;   ... we co-produce a lot of radio and tv programs with BSc.
&gt;   ... Slide 4 - lifelong learning
&gt;   ... small chunks of learning supported by accreditation
&gt;   ... Slide 5 - handing to Allan third
&gt; Allan Third:  Move to decentralization is important
&gt;   ... solid is a linked data platform started by Tim Berners lee.
&gt;   ... turns web applications into views on data
&gt;   ... Data is held by individual
&gt;   ... Slide 6
&gt;   ... You keep your data in data pods.  you permit applications
&gt;   to access your data to support what you want rather than what the
&gt;   application wants
&gt;   ... The linked data platform, solid concept, is linked data
&gt;   focused and friendly
&gt;   ... See a lot of discussion about personal data.  go to slide 7
&gt;   ... You can gain value from personal data but may have
&gt;   incentive to change it, to edit it.  if other people are going to
&gt;   give you value based on your personal data, you have to be able
&gt;   to verify it.
&gt;   ... you should be able to access and host it but also prove
&gt;   that the qualifications you derive are valid
&gt;   ... this is why we have been looking at blockchain to show your
&gt;   proofs haven't been edited
&gt;   ... Quals and work history, cv - services can be built on top.
&gt;   ... Can prove to others that you haven't tampered with vc.
&gt;   ... slide 9 - generic architecture - all purpose personal data
&gt;   store.  using solid to store data, blockchains to prove with VCs.
&gt;    Implement VC model on top of solid architecture.
&gt;   ... Pass to alex
&gt; Alexander Mikroyannidis:  Will present one of our most recent
&gt;   projects
&gt; Loïc Jeannin: @Kimhd: I'm already muted, that's interesting
&gt;   ... slide 11 - creation, piloting and evaluation of
&gt;   decentralized solutions for quals.
&gt;   ... ten partners - academic orgs and gov agencies.
&gt;   ... slide 12 - pilots
&gt;   ... slide 13 - lifelong learning pilot led by OU
&gt;   ... slide 14 - main stakeholders
&gt;   ... slide 15 main use case - personal portfolio of learner
&gt;   ... slide 16 Recommendations based on learner's skills
&gt;   ... Slide 18 Scoping landscape, understanding needs,
&gt;   consultation workshops
&gt;   ... Slide 19 Findings
&gt; Phil Long: +Q to mention is the personal eportfolio a generic
&gt;   analogy to a digital wallet?
&gt;   ... We are now moving on to next phase.  Developing
&gt;   decentralized solutions for lifelong learner
&gt; John Domingue:  Skills are important.  people study to improve
&gt;   job or get a job.
&gt;   ... There is a new eurpean standard that represents set number
&gt;   of hours of learning.
&gt;   ... Want to produce new accreditation for computing
&gt;   ... There may be a mismatch in skills
&gt;   ... Competence shows that a person can carry out work without
&gt;   supervision
&gt;   ... Slide 21
&gt;   ... Slide 22
&gt;   ... Slide 23 Gateway Descriptions
&gt;   ... slide 24 Site for Gateway Badges
&gt;   ... Slide 25 Gateway Badge Alignments
&gt; Niaz Chowdhury:  Presenting covid 19 system
&gt;   ... Slide 26 Covid-19 Antibody test / vaccination certification
&gt;   ... Builds on prior work, wanted to develop a smart phone app
&gt;   ... Slide 27 Timeline of Antibody Test / Vac Certification
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy: All: apologies that I got this session
&gt;   started late. Feel free to drop while we wrap up
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy: I'm having a hard time hearing the current
&gt;   speaker
&gt;   ... Slide 29
&gt;   ... Slide 33 - Main contributions
&gt;   ... We want to have a decentralized privacy preserving
&gt;   platform.
&gt;   ... We have been using our system for real students in UK.
&gt;   ... Our components are SOLID - to give learners control over
&gt;   data, including anayltics.
&gt;   ... Started using open badges now using VC.
&gt;   ... Use hashes on blockchain for verification
&gt; Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Slide 19 - question from Phil Long, is
&gt;   portfolio like wallet?
&gt; John Domingue:  Portfolio is layer over SOLID
&gt; Phil Long: Sorry - hung up before I could get the question out.
&gt;   I'll follow up with John D. separately.
&gt;   ... Slide 15 - semantic matching between skills you have and
&gt;   skills we are mining from jobs
&gt; Laura Jaurequi: Thank you!
&gt; Mano Ramachandran: @Kimhd thank you :)

&gt; My understanding of the FATF "travel rule" is that it applies to "VASPs"
&gt; (Virtual Asset Service Providers); i.e. exchanges and other custodial

&gt; missing something... If someone more knowledgeable of these regulations can

&gt;&gt; About wallets, has anyone thought about the Financial Action Task Force's
&gt;&gt; (FATF) “Travel Rule,” which stipulates that the originators and
&gt;&gt; beneficiaries of financial transactions over $1,000 must be identified and
&gt;&gt; that their personal data must “travel” with those transactions?  What are
&gt;&gt; the implications of such rules on what we’re doing here?

Topic: Introductions &amp; Reintroductions

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We are moving this meeting to every other 
  week.  will update calendar invites.
  ... want to move to work item focus in addition to speakers
  ... want to work on deliverables and still have good slate of 
  speakers
  ... next meeting in two weeks will talk about Modelling VC 
  document

Topic: Modeling Verifiable Credentials for Education

Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We want to come up with working examples of 
  VCs.  expressing well known credentials as VC.  using ILR 
  wrapper.  come up with good set of recommendations
  ... turn over to ILR group
  ... we recommend standards, incubate
  ... I will call on Jim Kelly and Nate Otto
  ... in document two topics
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit#heading=h.pqaju4ey6s0b">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit#heading=h.pqaju4ey6s0b</a>
.. 1. Xml formatted credentials
  ... do vc support XML as we thought they would, and does it 
  make more sense to model this in json or json-ld
  ... json-ld is an RDF serialization and so to can XML. assumed 
  therefore xml was supported, but realize now there is a bit more 
  work and not as straighforward, but is doable.
  ... could be a solution for any standard expressed as XML to 
  include those in VC.
  ... if we went the XML path there is some tooling work for 
  supporting signature screens.  we would be adding a new 
  serialization.  total work is small - bookkeeping.
Jim Kelly:  Pesc board chair and consultatnt
  ... all in XML like high school transcripts
  ... see need for move to JSON
Mano Ramachandran: Guys, do you have any India and UK specific 
  numbers?
  ... we've been discussing for some time.  we have a json-ld 
  task force in place for 2 or 3 years to discuss including 
  geocode, edxchange
  ... we have been discussing adding json versions of our xML 
  standards.  xml will not disappear.
Mano Ramachandran:  Sorry, we don't. But we are overhauling our 
  connection infrastructure and will have something more 
  modern/open by end of summer [scribe assist by Kim Hamilton 
  Duffy]
  ... not a small feat.  easy to create carbon copies.  easy to 
  create carbon copies in theory,, but not sure that's what the 
  community wants
  ... Michael sessa is also on the line, and can answer quetions
Mike Sessa: Good day all...can contact me at 
  <a href="mailto:michael.sessa@pesc.org?Subject=Re%3A%20%5BMINUTES%5D%20W3C%20CCG%20Verifiable%20Credentials%20for%20Education%20Task%20Force%20Call%20-%202020-07-13%2012pm%20ET&amp;In-Reply-To=%3C5f0f386b.1c69fb81.b1ba7.5221%40mx.google.com%3E&amp;References=%3C5f0f386b.1c69fb81.b1ba7.5221%40mx.google.com%3E">michael.sessa@pesc.org</a>
  ... there are tools that generate json from xml so creating a 
  carbon copy is not difficult.  working on it.  working group is 
  being put together to examine that as a standard
  ... process to standard creation that requires review and 
  approval.  steps are involved.
  ... we would be able to add a json version of our pesc 
  standards, but not clear when we could do json=ld
Driven and developed by PESC Members stepping up (not PESC staff)
  ... I have begun to realize the value of json=ld for our 
  standards especially as a payload because the payload becomes 
  semantically readable
  ... is readable as json but more valuable as json-ld
  ... I know there is a desire to have pesc formats in json but 
  we don't have a timeframe but we are pulling the process to 
  together to build a workgroup and gather the pieces to create a 
  new standard
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  The question of json vs json=ld is a good 
  conversation to have in this group
  ... efforts so far have assumed linked data but that has 
  additional complexity
  ... Even if we all like it it is still good to document
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json</a>
  ... Example 1 - course program certificate - this example shows 
  minimal education vc.  if you were designing the minimal thing 
  today that's what it would look like
  ... nate and I are teeing up discussion in a thread - what 
  terminology do we want to use?  ILR LER?
  ... how to model open badge as VC, etc.
Nate Otto:  This issue here is how do we model a claim that a 
  learner has gotten a certificate
  ... scroll to page 5, working example 1
  ... shows. a real world certificate and we want to put it in 
  language of VC
  ... VC allows any claim about someone, e.g., is someone over 
  21, favourite colour is green
  ... properties asserting about individual
Nate Otto: See the degree claim: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json#L17">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/blob/master/docs/edu/university-degree-verifiable-credential.json#L17</a>
  ... line 17 - the claim is degree - this subject with DID has 
  degree
  ... claiming degree is not a common claim
  ... of all the learning claims in your history very few are 
  degrees
  ... Is there a common claim type to represent achievement of 
  educational goal
  ... What is the core concept?
  ... An achievement level that has criteria and an issuer.  like 
  open badges class - as set of properties - criteria, image, 
  assessed by issuer
Phil Long: Is the problem Nate is discussing about a defined 
  achievement represents a poverty of structured learning outcomes 
  in the higher ed community?
  ... What does this mean - open badges calls it a badge - this 
  assertion is about this.  Idea is - 'has achieved'
  ... Scroll to page 7 - 'holds' means learner holds credential
  ... A term like hasAchieved should be used.
  ... Working example 5 is same thing - hasAchieved.  same idea 
  except competency is not necessarily defined by issuer of 
  credential itself.  could be a shared def across issuers
Allan Third: "HasDemonstrated" seems slightly more general?
  ... What is this idea of a hasAchieved claim?
  ... I think it has more power than something like 'degree'
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I agree.  should spend time.
.. Time to turn to main topic.  People from Open University to 
  talk about their deployment with solid and open badges

Topic: Open University, Solid, and Open Badges

John Domingue:  Joint presentation but colleagues having trouble 
  getting on call.
  ... Date is important - accreditation is almost like an event.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Voip noise
  ... Certain credentials have a lifespan.
  ... Now, to get into talk - going to overview our work at open 
  u.  we have been looking at blockchain accreditation.
  ... This is a set of highlights of our activities, especially 
  around covid-19
Phil Long: @John D's comment is important about a date as in most 
  higher ed achievements they are in a defined context based on 
  when they entered a degree pathway. The rules for achievements 
  are bound by the contract at the time of their declared major.
  ... Slide 1 - there is a URL to our main web site.
Allan Third:

  ... Slide 2 - overview of content
  ... We have a strong belief in social justice.  'open' means 
  you don't need any existing quals.
  ... Some students have studied for a decade.  Something like 
  20K disabled.
  ... Slide 3 - teaching at scale
  ... We have a Free learning platform
Phil Long: If you are not speaking (e.g., typing) please mute 
  your mic.
  ... we founded a mooc with 10 million registered learners.
  ... we co-produce a lot of radio and tv programs with BSc.
  ... Slide 4 - lifelong learning
  ... small chunks of learning supported by accreditation
  ... Slide 5 - handing to Allan third
Allan Third:  Move to decentralization is important
  ... solid is a linked data platform started by Tim Berners lee.
  ... turns web applications into views on data
  ... Data is held by individual
  ... Slide 6
  ... You keep your data in data pods.  you permit applications 
  to access your data to support what you want rather than what the 
  application wants
  ... The linked data platform, solid concept, is linked data 
  focused and friendly
  ... See a lot of discussion about personal data.  go to slide 7
  ... You can gain value from personal data but may have 
  incentive to change it, to edit it.  if other people are going to 
  give you value based on your personal data, you have to be able 
  to verify it.
  ... you should be able to access and host it but also prove 
  that the qualifications you derive are valid
  ... this is why we have been looking at blockchain to show your 
  proofs haven't been edited
  ... Quals and work history, cv - services can be built on top.
  ... Can prove to others that you haven't tampered with vc.
  ... slide 9 - generic architecture - all purpose personal data 
  store.  using solid to store data, blockchains to prove with VCs. 
   Implement VC model on top of solid architecture.
  ... Pass to alex
Alexander Mikroyannidis:  Will present one of our most recent 
  projects
Loïc Jeannin: @Kimhd: I'm already muted, that's interesting
  ... slide 11 - creation, piloting and evaluation of 
  decentralized solutions for quals.
  ... ten partners - academic orgs and gov agencies.
  ... slide 12 - pilots
  ... slide 13 - lifelong learning pilot led by OU
  ... slide 14 - main stakeholders
  ... slide 15 main use case - personal portfolio of learner
  ... slide 16 Recommendations based on learner's skills
  ... Slide 18 Scoping landscape, understanding needs, 
  consultation workshops
  ... Slide 19 Findings
Phil Long: +Q to mention is the personal eportfolio a generic 
  analogy to a digital wallet?
  ... We are now moving on to next phase.  Developing 
  decentralized solutions for lifelong learner
John Domingue:  Skills are important.  people study to improve 
  job or get a job.
  ... There is a new eurpean standard that represents set number 
  of hours of learning.
  ... Want to produce new accreditation for computing
  ... There may be a mismatch in skills
  ... Competence shows that a person can carry out work without 
  supervision
  ... Slide 21
  ... Slide 22
  ... Slide 23 Gateway Descriptions
  ... slide 24 Site for Gateway Badges
  ... Slide 25 Gateway Badge Alignments
Niaz Chowdhury:  Presenting covid 19 system
  ... Slide 26 Covid-19 Antibody test / vaccination certification
  ... Builds on prior work, wanted to develop a smart phone app
  ... Slide 27 Timeline of Antibody Test / Vac Certification
Kim Hamilton Duffy: All: apologies that I got this session 
  started late. Feel free to drop while we wrap up
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I'm having a hard time hearing the current 
  speaker
  ... Slide 29
  ... Slide 33 - Main contributions
  ... We want to have a decentralized privacy preserving 
  platform.
  ... We have been using our system for real students in UK.
  ... Our components are SOLID - to give learners control over 
  data, including anayltics.
  ... Started using open badges now using VC.
  ... Use hashes on blockchain for verification
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Slide 19 - question from Phil Long, is 
  portfolio like wallet?
John Domingue:  Portfolio is layer over SOLID
Phil Long: Sorry - hung up before I could get the question out. 
  I'll follow up with John D. separately.
  ... Slide 15 - semantic matching between skills you have and 
  skills we are mining from jobs
Laura Jaurequi: Thank you!
Mano Ramachandran: @Kimhd thank you :)

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of iProov?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.iproov.com/">iProov’s</a> mission is to make the internet a safer place for businesses and consumers. We provide trusted biometric authentication that is seamless, secure and effortless. Our vision is for all  governments and enterprise institutions to  be confident that the remote user is real and can be trusted. iProov strongly believes that the user and usability should be the heart of any solution and as such must be accessible to all users irrespective of their abilities, literacy and digital capability.</p>



<p>iProov ensures trust online through Genuine Presence Assurance. Governments, financial institutions and other enterprises are using iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance technology to ensure that an online user is not only the right person, but that they are a real person and authenticating right now. This unique approach protects against impersonation and criminal attacks, providing the highest levels of security alongside effortless usability. </p>



  



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>One of the most significant challenges with digital service is establishing trust. A key element of which is how to bind the digital identity attributes of a person, to the person and assuring only they can assert that identity. As online digital becomes the primary channel to interact with services, customers and citizens are increasingly vulnerable to impersonation attacks from fraudsters compromising their identity. It is crucial to have consented, secure and effortless identity verification and authentication for everyone.</p>



<p>In many economies, parts of the citizen population have no formal identity documentation. Embracing digital identities will enable all members of society to be included, enabling them to unlock access to services previously not possible.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does iProov address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identities are the cornerstone of doing businesses in the 21st century, they offer speed and flexibility in remote interactions which creates greater competition, economical efficiency, and greater citizen empowerment and inclusion.</p>



<p>iProov provides governments and enterprises with a very high level of assurance that the person interacting with their service is the legitimate user while protecting against criminal attacks. iProov Genuine Presence Assurance technology ensures trust by validating and authenticating users online to the highest level of certainty i.e. that a user is a real person, the right person, and authenticating right now.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>DIACC is playing a critically important role in coordinating a national digital identity and framework in a way that is notably lacking in the US and UK. By showing how a liberal democracy can successfully empower citizens with a nationally structured system of digital identity, Canada will exert a very powerful influence on both sides of the Atlantic and help lead the G7 to a better place.</p>



<p>5. Why did iProov join the DIACC?</p>



<p>iProov believes that trust between a provider and its citizens or customers must be achieved alongside two critical objectives:</p>



  Accessibility and inclusion – providing services which offer maximum access, irrespective of their abilities, literacy and digital savviness.  Sustainable security – ensuring a secure environment, business processes and centralized management controls to flexibly evolve and manage future, unknown risks.  



<p>It is this experience and insight that iProov brings to DIACC and can help DIACC in developing digital identity standards. </p>



<p>6. What else should we know about iProov?</p>



<p>The iProov solutions are trusted at national scale levels today with institutions such as:</p>



  The UK National Health Service – iProov provides strong authentication to onboard citizens in the UK to the NHS Login mobile app. With iProov, citizens registering for the NHS app are able to authenticate themselves in real-time with the image on their passport or driver’s license, allowing them to book medical appointments, order repeat prescriptions, and gain access to their patient record.   The UK Home Office – the EU Settled Status scheme is utilizing iProov to assure the genuine presence of remote users and to verify that the applicant is the rightful holder of the validated ID document. Over 3 million EU citizens have used the service to apply for permanent residency status.  



<p>It is this experience and insight that iProov brings to DIACC and can help DIACC in developing digital identity standards. </p>



<p>iProov’s proven, simple and inclusive user experience is critical to the service we offer to our Government and Enterprise customers, and has been a key contributor to our successful engagements with some of the world’s most security-conscious and user-friendly organizations. </p>

<p>Kantara To Share Its Digital Identity Assurance Program Learnings, Schemes, Specifications, Best Practice Guidelines To Support Digital Identity New Zealand’s Mission&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA and WELLINGTON, New Zealand – July 15, 2020 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> announced today that it has agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity New Zealand</a> (DINZ) to support the goal of energizing New Zealand’s digital identity ecosystem development, where everyone can prove who they are digitally to organizations in a secure and trusted way.&nbsp; Kantara will share its digital identity assurance program learnings, schemes, specifications and best practice guidelines with DINZ in support of its mission.</p>
<p>With headquarters in the United States and the European Union, Kantara is the leading global consortium improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice.&nbsp; Kantara has similar collaboration agreements in Canada and Europe as well as being <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">the only organization providing third party assessment and assurance against the US National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-63-3 for identity</a> and authentication.</p>
<p>DINZ is a purpose driven, inclusive, membership funded organization, whose members have a shared passion for the opportunities that digital identity can offer. DINZ supports a sustainable, inclusive and trustworthy digital future for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Kantara Executive Director and Native New Zealander Colin Wallis said, “For a decade, Kantara has worked with governments and standards-bodies internationally sharing its assurance program knowledge, schemes, specifications and best practices in the digital identity and privacy space with the goal of building trustworthy networks and ensuring people have agency over their data. We’ve worked hard to align these programs for multi-jurisdictional adoption and believe that Kantara’s global mission and DINZ’s national goals are mutually supportive.&nbsp; We look forward to working together and sharing knowledge, not only to drive forward ecosystem development in New Zealand but also to support improved global interoperability of digital identity. The effort will work hand in hand with the public sector digital identity initiatives – the Department of Internal Affairs in New Zealand, the Digital Transformation Agency in Australia and the US Postal Service – all of whom support the Kantara Initiative.”</p>
<p>Andrew Weaver, Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, said, “Collaboration is at the heart of our work here at Digital Identity New Zealand. We are excited to be working with the Kantara Initiative, drawing from the depth of wisdom and experience they have built up over the last ten years.&nbsp; In return we hope to share some of our digital identity journey here in Aotearoa/New Zealand with the wider Kantara community.&nbsp; Since our establishment late in 2018 we have been introduced to and explored the concept of ‘Identity as Taonga’, Taonga being a Maori word that describes something precious and treasured, worthy of the highest levels of dignity, care and respect.&nbsp; We look forward to exploring these ideas with other communities around the world, learning together what it means to build truly inclusive and diverse identity ecosystems”</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>
<p>The Kantara Initiative is the leading global consortium improving trustworthy use of digital identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. Kantara provides real-world innovation through its development of specifications, applied R&amp;D and operational conformity assessment programs for the digital identity and personal data ecosystems.

         My understanding of the FATF "travel rule" is that it applies to "VASPs"
(Virtual Asset Service Providers); i.e. exchanges and other custodial
platforms. I don't think it applies to personal wallets, but I may be
missing something... If someone more knowledgeable of these regulations can
jump in to clarify on the matter, I'd appreciate it.

  Some of my feedback to the IAB will be that the document is too oriented toward a client-server view, and more particularly, a view in which the user's interests are communicated via a "user agent" that mediates between the user and the services that the user is accessing. &nbsp; But the web is not accurately viewed as a client-server system any more, but rather a large-scale distributed system wit

  It isn't just the words; it's the metaphorical framing out of which the words arise. You can see that framing in marketing verbs such as "target," "capture," "own," "manage," "control" and "lock in." These say that, to the marketers using those verbs, that customers are wild animals to be kept as cattle or slaves.

Also, since client-server (a euphemism for slave-master) became the default architecture for web services, we're kind of stuck with those expressions until we successfully introduce a better frame that starts with people. It's an uphill effort, but I am sure it can (and should) be done.  <br>  Doc   <br>

 About wallets, has anyone thought about the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) “Travel Rule,” which stipulates that the originators and beneficiaries of financial transactions over $1,000 must be identified and that their personal data must “travel” with those transactions?

<div class='wrap'>

<p>One of the key deterrents in the adoption of blockchain/DLT today is that it is perceived as a complex technology, with a time-consuming network setup and operations. Accenture’s <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/future-systems/future-ready-enterprise-systems">Future Systems</a> research shows that, for companies across the world, the biggest barrier to innovation at scale is the ability to build flexible, uniform architectures capable of responding to market demands. This is in line with what we hear from our blockchain clients who want to know how to scale a blockchain trial to a production environment while safeguarding their investments.</p>



<p>The presence of a variety of enterprise DLT providers today such as Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Indy, Hyperledger Besu, R3 Corda, Quorum and more, each with their own architecture and disparate services, compound the complexity in the world of DLT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We get it. Getting started can be hard.</p>



<p>Setting up a new DLT network or maintaining an existing DLT network in a production-scale environment is not straightforward. For the existing DLT platforms, the steps in setting up one DLT network cannot be applied to others. When blockchain developers are asked to use an unfamiliar DLT platform, it requires a great deal of effort for even experienced technicians to properly setup the DLT network. This is especially true in large-scale production projects across multiple corporate environments more focused on other key aspects such as security and service availability.</p>



<p>Another problematic trend across many different organizations’ blockchain/DLT implementations is the PoC (Proof of Concept) first approach. While this is a sound way to test whether the technology can work, scalability and security are not part of the design at the outset, and so significant efforts are required to rearchitect and rebuild for production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud vendors such as AWS and Azure offer managed blockchain services (aka Blockchain as a Service or BaaS) to help alleviate various pain points during the process of preparing a production-scale DLT network. However, these solutions have network size limitations, lock all nodes into a single cloud provider, or offer few choices for DLT platforms, which may be deal-breakers in some scenarios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if it didn’t have to be?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine if the several weeks of development time required to set up and deploy a DLT network could be reduced to a matter of hours. What if the same framework developed for a PoC could scale to pilots and production, evolving along with the applied solution for faster innovation and more seamless innovation?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With these opportunities in mind, our team at Accenture Blockchain and Multiparty Systems started conceptualizing “Blockchain Automation Framework.” BAF helps developers rapidly set up and deploy secure, scalable and production-ready solutions that also allow new organizations to be easily onboarded on the network. BAF accelerates delivery and lets developers focus on building blockchain applications without having to waste precious time standing up the environment or worrying whether the network will scale and meet production requirements.</p>



<p>How does it work?</p>



<p>Using a single configuration file, you deploy the distributed network on a cloud infrastructure of your choice, including certificate management and smart contract installation. Whether developing an early stage PoC, late stage pilot, or scaling for production, Blockchain Automation Framework can reduce the time required to bring up the network from days to hours. The secure, fault tolerant framework helps to ease onboarding of new organizations and accelerate testing or production deployments in multicloud or multiparty systems.</p>



<p>Here is a quick look at the components and features BAF uses to automate network deployment:</p>



  <a href="https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyConcepts/ansible.html">Ansible</a> playbooks and role definitions that follow a specific order to automate the entire DLT network setup  <a href="https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyConcepts/vault.html">HashiCorp Vaults</a> to securely store tokens, passwords and certificates  <a href="https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyConcepts/kubernetes.html?highlight=kubernetes">Kubernetes services</a>, including Ambassador or HAProxy Ingress Controller, to route traffic and enable inter cluster communication  <a href="https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyConcepts/gitops.html">GitOps</a> method for continuous deployment to Kubernetes clusters via Flux operator  <a href="https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyConcepts/helm.html">Helm Charts</a> for designing and configuring the architecture  The ability to share a configured <a href="https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations/setting_dlt.html?highlight=network.yaml#edit-the-configuration-file">network.yaml file</a> without disclosing any confidentiality

People are rushing to find solutions, and people who were procrastinating are committed to changing,” explained Patrick Drolet, VP, Operations and Product Strategy, <a href="https://diacc.ca/2016/05/05/spotlight-on-notarius/">Notarius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional sectors, like the legal sector, banking, education, and government, are particularly impacted by requirements to stay physically distant. As organizations that are heavily reliant on paper documents, witnesses, and face-to-face meetings, working in a new digital and decentralized format can present challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What has amazed me is the variety of people who want to go digital,” Marc St-Jacques, VP, Sales and Marketing at Notarius said. “Everything from government to industry, health, [and] universities.”</p>



<p>Making the transition to digital isn’t always straightforward. For many of these secure, highly sensitive industries, a foundation of strong, trusted, and protected digital identity is necessary to continue operating. As individuals and businesses shift their focus and, in some cases, scramble to quickly adapt, a delta is opening up between those who were already moving towards digital transformation – and those who were dragging their feet.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“It is not business as usual. People are rushing to find solutions, and people who were procrastinating are committed to changing.” </p></blockquote>



<p>“On the one hand, individuals forced into digital are going now. It also illustrates the disparity between approaches. The shift has made everyone stand out,” St-Jacques explained. Whether it’s because they’re practiced in offering digital solutions or because they’ve been holding off, St-Jacques says it’s easy to see how different businesses operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>, can help close the gap between early adopters and laggards, and ensure everyone has a clear path to operating in an increasingly digital-first world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Notarius, there are two product lines that have been in high-demand in the wake of COVID-19. The traditional “old fashioned identity” that is consistently a big part of their business, and renewed interest in the document part. Secure, remote digital signatures and document execution are presenting a lot of opportunities for their clients to move forward. At the onset of the pandemic, they offered 60-day free trials and special offers, helping make the transition even easier for clients.<br></p>



<p>Witnessing the Shift in Industries</p>



<p>The industries who are showing the most interest are traditional sectors that may have been slow to adopt and adapt to digital technologies. “We are seeing a lot of appetite from the government. It is refreshing to see, as [the sector] has been slow to adopt. The biggest uptake, though, is in the university marketplace, both inside and outside of Quebec. They have moved quickly,” St-Jacques said.</p>



<p>“In many instances, organizations were held back by a department or two,” St-Jacques explained. “Legal departments were often the roadblock.” Those departments, including IT and government sectors, are now transforming rapidly to keep up.</p>



<p>The change is not – and cannot – only happen at the organizational level, though. From provincial to federal governments, the pandemic is accelerating change. “There is a long list of laws that were not ID-friendly. Government used to be so slow. They are moving now, which is super exciting,” Drolet said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One example is the notary bar in Quebec, a completely paper-based line of work. Although digital transformation was under consideration for the past four or five years, in the COVID-19 era, it took just three weeks for a temporary law to be passed so notaries can work in a digital format.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across the board, attitudes are changing and, in many cases, charting a digital path forward is no longer an option – it’s necessary for survival. The <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> ensures businesses from all industries will be able to interact seamlessly with government and other industries, creating more efficiencies and helping all Canadian industries meet a baseline for privacy, security and usability.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Digital ID Helps Maintain Connections Across Closed Borders</p>



<p>In a highly connected, global environment, these tools offer more options to continue connecting internationally. “Foreign students need their transcripts, they want to do their exams. Transcripts are like the identity of organizations,” St-Jacques explained, connecting the trends in education to other sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through Notarius, these identifying documents are connected with a digital signature that it is clear and immediate, appealing to teams around the world. “We’re seeing requests from Europe, Asia, and the US,” St-Jacques shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the international part, we are the only one recognized by Adobe. We were the only platform certified with EIDAS, with the highest standards,” Drolet explained.<br></p>



<p>Looking Ahead as Old Barriers Come Down</p>



<p>While the situation has not been ideal for anyone, the speed with which many have had to respond to this serious outbreak has led to some positive changes. “Usually it would be a structured and siloed process. Now, everyone is scrambling and can take initiative,” Drolet shared. “They see the value and what used to take weeks, now takes 15 minutes. Unfortunately, the pandemic was the driver.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what does the future look like?</p>



<p>For digital identity, Drolet predicts a surge in interest and adoption. “Who are your competitors in the ID space? The bad guy used to be the pen, now even that guy is going away,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For industries, St-Jacques envisions lasting change. “I really don’t see people going back,” St-Jacques predicts. Old concerns about security, processes, and reluctance to change are being dissolved, as the rapid changes set precedent for what’s possible.</p>

         Yeah the first external auditing option you mentioned is what we have been
trying out.
But that basically confirms that the way we are trying is reasonable, and
no need to make it more complicated.
I had just never seen a VC as an attribute inside a single signer VC
before, so just had to try it out.

&gt; Blinded threshold signatures wouldn’t be a good fit for a use case like
&gt; that. Instead, this would be an example where a single issuer would likely

&gt; want the person who performs the checks on behalf of the school to be
&gt; internally logged assuming it was built for internal auditing.
&gt;
&gt; In the case where external auditing is necessary, this may be a good case
&gt; for making a VC an attribute of another VC within the credentialSubject
&gt; field, where the first attribute is signed by the person who performed the
&gt; check on behalf of the school and the then school signs the VC with it
&gt; contained in it.
&gt;
&gt; If you wanted to use some fancier crypto though, a regular threshold
&gt; signature (BLS signature which is unblinded) would be a good option
&gt; instead. However, I’m not certain the example you provided would warrant
&gt; using something heavier like this given the tradeoffs you’d likely
&gt; encounter because of it.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I just want to shoot in another use case where there might be an obvious
&gt; solution that I dont know about.
&gt;
&gt; That is a course certificate, or a grade certificate.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is usually issued by the school itself. The school is the
&gt; representing DID/group.
&gt;
&gt; But it is also signed but the person who basically checked the records and
&gt; approved this student to be elgible for passing.
&gt;
&gt; This person is an important factor for having some kind of accountability
&gt; on who said this was OK.
&gt;
&gt; Is that internal audit, or should it be external audit, meaning the
&gt; teacher/administrator or teacher(s)/administrator(s) who clicked the button
&gt; should be represented in a VC?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Should the school DID be the single issue/signatory, or the group as Kyle
&gt; represents it as.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And the audit of who accepted this certificate to be issued is covered by
&gt; blinded treshold signatures?

&gt;
&gt; There's a few tradeoffs that I'd point out when it comes to single-issuer
&gt; / single-signer VCs:
&gt;
&gt; A non-exhaustive list of advantages are:
&gt;
&gt;    1. It's easier to build a flow like this using more mature aspects of
&gt;    the ecosystem already defined such as how to issue and verify a credential
&gt;    over things like CHAPI, DIDComm, OIDC, etc.
&gt;    2. Issuer correlation is explicit (more on when you might not want
&gt;    this below)
&gt;
&gt; A non-exhaustive list of dis-advantages are:
&gt;
&gt;    1. This requires the holder to go collect VCs from more issuers
&gt;    (meaning discovery, collection, and storage can be a bit more difficult in
&gt;    a limited set of cases - but not impractical)
&gt;    2. This makes the amount of data sent to a verifier redundant and
&gt;    larger (e.g. I'm redundantly sending the same credentialSubject data, but
&gt;    with new signatures for each one from different issuers - the ZKP
&gt;    verifiable presentation nullifies this problem by allowing credentials to
&gt;    be aggregated together in a proof though)
&gt;    3. It limits capabilities of issuers which more advanced cryptography
&gt;    can help with (see below for a use case)
&gt;
&gt; In general, *I find that Manu is correct though that using single-issuer
&gt; / single-signer flows can address most of what's needed* and in the case
&gt; where multiple issuers are needed the holder can just gather multiple
&gt; credentials and present them together to the verifier.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As an example where multi-signatures using advanced crypto may be useful
&gt; think of this use case:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A group of issuers want to get together and issue a credential. They set
&gt; two requirements. The first requirement is that the issuer of the
&gt; credentials must be the group rather than multiple individual participants
&gt; representing the group. This is because they want the group to be the
&gt; authority not any particular individual participant of the group.
&gt; Furthermore, there's a second requirement that due diligence should be done
&gt; by multiple parties of the consortium and they must all sign off, without
&gt; explicitly linking to who performed the verification. In this case blinded-threshold
&gt; signatures &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1">https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1</a>&gt; can address this
&gt; use case in a way that would best fit the requirements of the (theoretical)
&gt; use case and using multiple credentials wouldn't meet the first
&gt; requirement. I'm sure there's other use cases that are similar to this, but
&gt; as Manu pointed out they're likely to be very limited and in general the
&gt; holder collecting multiple credentials should be the preferred path.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; However, even in the limited cases where this may be necessary its
&gt; possible that an LD Proof suite can be defined to do so and in my opinion
&gt; would be the preferred path.

&gt; The Veres One DID Method uses set signatures for writing DID Document

&gt; proof that you are the DID controller.
&gt;
&gt; That said, multi-sig use cases are often more complex than they need to
&gt; be and when you break down the use case, the sort of verifiable

&gt; paper is often bad data modelling, and we can be more precise in the
&gt; digital world.
&gt;
&gt; I suggest you try to solve your problem by using simple single-issuer /
&gt; single-signer VCs. We have come across very few use cases that require
&gt; multisig -- including the use case that I think you're asserting needs
&gt; to be solved with a multisig.
&gt;
&gt; If you find that you absolutely need multisig, LD Proofs can do it (set

I meant to address this by #2 (saying that the baseline spec has those contents), but failed to mention it will be a ccg repo. I think the addition (in bold) gets it to the state I intended.

1. Combine vc-issuer-http-api[1] and vc-verifier-http-api[2] into 1 w3c-ccg repo called vc-http-api
2. Update new baseline spec to these contents: <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-http-api/">https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-http-api/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftransmute-industries.github.io%2Fvc-http-api%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C0d61667f58ff4aa3e17508d827915336%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637302852421127685&amp;sdata=H5v7QEst">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftransmute-industries.github.io%2Fvc-http-api%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C0d61667f58ff4aa3e17508d827915336%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637302852421127685&amp;sdata=H5v7QEst</a>g6i%2BzxporpKYJqfkSilOFTtuimmPWMkf3s8%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;
3. Update the accounting on the CCG work items page[3] to reflect 1 work item instead of 2.

Yes, I believe not mentioning that we'll move the repo at Transmute into
the W3C CCG's purview was an oversight. All official CCG work items end
up in the CCG's Github repo, usually sooner than later, and often when a
proposal to adopt/merge reaches consensus (which should happen after the
call tomorrow, unless someone objects).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just want to shoot in another use case where there might be an obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt; solution that I dont know about.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a course certificate, or a grade certificate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is usually issued by the school itself. The school is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; representing DID/group.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is also signed but the person who basically checked the records
&gt;&gt;&gt; and approved this student to be elgible for passing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This person is an important factor for having some kind of
&gt;&gt;&gt; accountability on who said this was OK.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that internal audit, or should it be external audit, meaning the
&gt;&gt;&gt; teacher/administrator or teacher(s)/administrator(s) who clicked the button
&gt;&gt;&gt; should be represented in a VC?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Should the school DID be the single issue/signatory, or the group as
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kyle represents it as.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; And the audit of who accepted this certificate to be issued is covered
&gt;&gt;&gt; by blinded treshold signatures?

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a few tradeoffs that I'd point out when it comes to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single-issuer / single-signer VCs:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A non-exhaustive list of advantages are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    1. It's easier to build a flow like this using more mature aspects
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    of the ecosystem already defined such as how to issue and verify a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    credential over things like CHAPI, DIDComm, OIDC, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    2. Issuer correlation is explicit (more on when you might not want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    this below)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A non-exhaustive list of dis-advantages are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    1. This requires the holder to go collect VCs from more issuers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    (meaning discovery, collection, and storage can be a bit more difficult in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    a limited set of cases - but not impractical)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    2. This makes the amount of data sent to a verifier redundant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    larger (e.g. I'm redundantly sending the same credentialSubject data, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    with new signatures for each one from different issuers - the ZKP
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    verifiable presentation nullifies this problem by allowing credentials to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    be aggregated together in a proof though)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    3. It limits capabilities of issuers which more advanced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    cryptography can help with (see below for a use case)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In general, *I find that Manu is correct though that using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single-issuer / single-signer flows can address most of what's needed*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in the case where multiple issuers are needed the holder can just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gather multiple credentials and present them together to the verifier.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As an example where multi-signatures using advanced crypto may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; useful think of this use case:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A group of issuers want to get together and issue a credential. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set two requirements. The first requirement is that the issuer of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credentials must be the group rather than multiple individual participants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representing the group. This is because they want the group to be the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authority not any particular individual participant of the group.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, there's a second requirement that due diligence should be done
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by multiple parties of the consortium and they must all sign off, without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explicitly linking to who performed the verification. In this case blinded-threshold
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; signatures &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1">https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1</a>&gt; can address
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this use case in a way that would best fit the requirements of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (theoretical) use case and using multiple credentials wouldn't meet the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first requirement. I'm sure there's other use cases that are similar to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this, but as Manu pointed out they're likely to be very limited and in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; general the holder collecting multiple credentials should be the preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; path.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, even in the limited cases where this may be necessary its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible that an LD Proof suite can be defined to do so and in my opinion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be the preferred path.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that Linked Data Proofs have supported unordered set signatures
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered set signatures for a number of years now:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Veres One DID Method uses set signatures for writing DID Document
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operations to the ledger, where the first signature is a proof to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you have the authority to write to the ledger and the second is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proof that you are the DID controller.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, multi-sig use cases are often more complex than they need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be and when you break down the use case, the sort of verifiable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credential being issued is slightly different. That is, what we do on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paper is often bad data modelling, and we can be more precise in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; digital world.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suggest you try to solve your problem by using simple single-issuer /
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single-signer VCs. We have come across very few use cases that require
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multisig -- including the use case that I think you're asserting needs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be solved with a multisig.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you find that you absolutely need multisig, LD Proofs can do it (set
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or chained).

         <a>George, I think that last question of yours is very suiting for the working
group Kim is running. And not necessarily this thread, as it is a bit off
topic.
But contact </a><a href="mailto:kimhd@mit.edu?Subject=Re%3A%20Multi-sig%20credentials%3F&amp;In-Reply-To=%3CCAE8zwO1ZE3F3Ebo3W%2BZh0gtbGrL4d_nAvUtQtmXv-hOTkNyB-Q%40mail.gmail.com%3E&amp;References=%3CCAE8zwO1ZE3F3Ebo3W%2BZh0gtbGrL4d_nAvUtQtmXv-hOTkNyB-Q%40mail.gmail.com%3E">kimhd@mit.edu</a> and see how you can raise that question or see if
they have any good discussions going on that subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a few tradeoffs that I'd point out when it comes to
&gt;&gt;&gt; single-issuer / single-signer VCs:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; A non-exhaustive list of advantages are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;    1. It's easier to build a flow like this using more mature aspects
&gt;&gt;&gt;    of the ecosystem already defined such as how to issue and verify a
&gt;&gt;&gt;    credential over things like CHAPI, DIDComm, OIDC, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;    2. Issuer correlation is explicit (more on when you might not want
&gt;&gt;&gt;    this below)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; A non-exhaustive list of dis-advantages are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;    1. This requires the holder to go collect VCs from more issuers
&gt;&gt;&gt;    (meaning discovery, collection, and storage can be a bit more difficult in
&gt;&gt;&gt;    a limited set of cases - but not impractical)
&gt;&gt;&gt;    2. This makes the amount of data sent to a verifier redundant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;    larger (e.g. I'm redundantly sending the same credentialSubject data, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;    with new signatures for each one from different issuers - the ZKP
&gt;&gt;&gt;    verifiable presentation nullifies this problem by allowing credentials to
&gt;&gt;&gt;    be aggregated together in a proof though)
&gt;&gt;&gt;    3. It limits capabilities of issuers which more advanced
&gt;&gt;&gt;    cryptography can help with (see below for a use case)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In general, *I find that Manu is correct though that using
&gt;&gt;&gt; single-issuer / single-signer flows can address most of what's needed*
&gt;&gt;&gt; and in the case where multiple issuers are needed the holder can just
&gt;&gt;&gt; gather multiple credentials and present them together to the verifier.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As an example where multi-signatures using advanced crypto may be useful
&gt;&gt;&gt; think of this use case:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; A group of issuers want to get together and issue a credential. They set
&gt;&gt;&gt; two requirements. The first requirement is that the issuer of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; credentials must be the group rather than multiple individual participants
&gt;&gt;&gt; representing the group. This is because they want the group to be the
&gt;&gt;&gt; authority not any particular individual participant of the group.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, there's a second requirement that due diligence should be done
&gt;&gt;&gt; by multiple parties of the consortium and they must all sign off, without
&gt;&gt;&gt; explicitly linking to who performed the verification. In this case blinded-threshold
&gt;&gt;&gt; signatures &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1">https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1</a>&gt; can address
&gt;&gt;&gt; this use case in a way that would best fit the requirements of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; (theoretical) use case and using multiple credentials wouldn't meet the
&gt;&gt;&gt; first requirement. I'm sure there's other use cases that are similar to
&gt;&gt;&gt; this, but as Manu pointed out they're likely to be very limited and in
&gt;&gt;&gt; general the holder collecting multiple credentials should be the preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt; path.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, even in the limited cases where this may be necessary its
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible that an LD Proof suite can be defined to do so and in my opinion
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be the preferred path.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that Linked Data Proofs have supported unordered set signatures and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#multiple-proofs">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#multiple-proofs</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Veres One DID Method uses set signatures for writing DID Document
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operations to the ledger, where the first signature is a proof to assert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you have the authority to write to the ledger and the second is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proof that you are the DID controller.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, multi-sig use cases are often more complex than they need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be and when you break down the use case, the sort of verifiable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credential being issued is slightly different. That is, what we do on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paper is often bad data modelling, and we can be more precise in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; digital world.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suggest you try to solve your problem by using simple single-issuer /
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single-signer VCs. We have come across very few use cases that require
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multisig -- including the use case that I think you're asserting needs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be solved with a multisig.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you find that you absolutely need multisig, LD Proofs can do it (set
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or chained).

&gt;
&gt; A non-exhaustive list of advantages are:
&gt;
&gt;    1. It's easier to build a flow like this using more mature aspects of
&gt;    the ecosystem already defined such as how to issue and verify a credential
&gt;    over things like CHAPI, DIDComm, OIDC, etc.
&gt;    2. Issuer correlation is explicit (more on when you might not want
&gt;    this below)
&gt;
&gt; A non-exhaustive list of dis-advantages are:
&gt;
&gt;    1. This requires the holder to go collect VCs from more issuers
&gt;    (meaning discovery, collection, and storage can be a bit more difficult in
&gt;    a limited set of cases - but not impractical)
&gt;    2. This makes the amount of data sent to a verifier redundant and
&gt;    larger (e.g. I'm redundantly sending the same credentialSubject data, but
&gt;    with new signatures for each one from different issuers - the ZKP
&gt;    verifiable presentation nullifies this problem by allowing credentials to
&gt;    be aggregated together in a proof though)
&gt;    3. It limits capabilities of issuers which more advanced cryptography
&gt;    can help with (see below for a use case)
&gt;
&gt; In general, *I find that Manu is correct though that using single-issuer
&gt; / single-signer flows can address most of what's needed* and in the case
&gt; where multiple issuers are needed the holder can just gather multiple
&gt; credentials and present them together to the verifier.
&gt;
&gt; As an example where multi-signatures using advanced crypto may be useful
&gt; think of this use case:
&gt;
&gt; A group of issuers want to get together and issue a credential. They set
&gt; two requirements. The first requirement is that the issuer of the
&gt; credentials must be the group rather than multiple individual participants
&gt; representing the group. This is because they want the group to be the
&gt; authority not any particular individual participant of the group.
&gt; Furthermore, there's a second requirement that due diligence should be done
&gt; by multiple parties of the consortium and they must all sign off, without
&gt; explicitly linking to who performed the verification. In this case blinded-threshold
&gt; signatures &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1">https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751059?seq=1</a>&gt; can address this
&gt; use case in a way that would best fit the requirements of the (theoretical)
&gt; use case and using multiple credentials wouldn't meet the first
&gt; requirement. I'm sure there's other use cases that are similar to this, but
&gt; as Manu pointed out they're likely to be very limited and in general the
&gt; holder collecting multiple credentials should be the preferred path.
&gt;
&gt; However, even in the limited cases where this may be necessary its
&gt; possible that an LD Proof suite can be defined to do so and in my opinion
&gt; would be the preferred path.

&gt;&gt; The Veres One DID Method uses set signatures for writing DID Document
&gt;&gt; operations to the ledger, where the first signature is a proof to assert

&gt;&gt; proof that you are the DID controller.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That said, multi-sig use cases are often more complex than they need to
&gt;&gt; be and when you break down the use case, the sort of verifiable
&gt;&gt; credential being issued is slightly different. That is, what we do on
&gt;&gt; paper is often bad data modelling, and we can be more precise in the
&gt;&gt; digital world.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I suggest you try to solve your problem by using simple single-issuer /
&gt;&gt; single-signer VCs. We have come across very few use cases that require
&gt;&gt; multisig -- including the use case that I think you're asserting needs
&gt;&gt; to be solved with a multisig.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you find that you absolutely need multisig, LD Proofs can do it (set

The Veres One DID Method uses set signatures for writing DID Document
operations to the ledger, where the first signature is a proof to assert
that you have the authority to write to the ledger and the second is a
proof that you are the DID controller.

That said, multi-sig use cases are often more complex than they need to
be and when you break down the use case, the sort of verifiable
credential being issued is slightly different. That is, what we do on
paper is often bad data modelling, and we can be more precise in the
digital world.

I suggest you try to solve your problem by using simple single-issuer /
single-signer VCs. We have come across very few use cases that require
multisig -- including the use case that I think you're asserting needs
to be solved with a multisig.

If you find that you absolutely need multisig, LD Proofs can do it (set
or chained).

Hi all,
This is following up on a proposal from the owners of the vc-issuer and vc-verifier work items, in which they'd like to merge the 2 separate work items into one.

We discussed this on a previous call, and there was broad support among the owners for merging these items, so I don't think a full 1-week waiting period is needed to approve this. This is effectively a bookkeeping update.

We'll briefly discuss during the action item review tomorrow and move forward unless there are any objections.

PROPOSAL:
1. Combine vc-issuer-http-api[1] and vc-verifier-http-api[2] into 1 repo called vc-http-api
2. Update new baseline spec to these contents: <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-http-api/">https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-http-api/</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftransmute-industries.github.io%2Fvc-http-api%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7Cdbf857d26ed14a1e985a08d827658dd4%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C1%7C637302664424201311&amp;sdata=tuNAOHRR">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftransmute-industries.github.io%2Fvc-http-api%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7Cdbf857d26ed14a1e985a08d827658dd4%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C1%7C637302664424201311&amp;sdata=tuNAOHRR</a>6xMya0O0XzhbzxpF7Qi3X26QFFVIrf4cjXc%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;
3. Update the accounting on the CCG work items page[3] to reflect 1 work item instead of 2.

This is important in parallel signature workflows such as two partners/spouses signing a property purchase agreement or a lease where neither is necessary signing the other person’s signature.  This differs from the case where you have a notary (or equivalent) that is signing “over” previous signatures.

In that context, not only do we have the issues raised by Dmitri and the VC data model and Daniel about DID’s, but you also may have to address issues with the canonicalization of the data format being signed (eg. JSON/JSON-LD).

Hi Keerthi,

As Daniel mentioned, this is an important question, and has come up several times.

Hello everyone,

I thought this community might be able to provide some direction. I am still on the learning curve, apologies if I missed some earlier work done by yourselves.

I am currently working on a problem which I think may have already been solved, I would appreciate it if you can kindly point me in the right direction.

I understand and I have previously built POCs using Hyperledger Indy/Aries that allows for verifiable credentials to be issued by a single party (issuer). The question is, how do we issue verifiable credentials issued by multiple-parties?

Contracts and other legal documents are sometimes signed between multiple (more than two) parties. In a paper based approach, it is relatively straightforward, signatures are obtained serially.  A similar approach is adopted in electronic signing where copies of PDF are signed serially, internally, the system generates a 'certificate of completion' which captures metadata for legal purposes.

In the real-estate use-case I am currently working on similar 'certificate of completion' to hold multiple cryptographic signatures of contracting parties over an digital artifact i.e. 'smart legal contract' (for simplicity, consider the artifact as a file containing some text and source code before they are deployed on a DLT or VM). I was thinking the SSI + VC model could be appropriate for this 'certificate of agreement or completion' but I am happy to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

Many thanks in advance.

Best wishes,
Keerthi Thomas

         Yes, there has been some thought around this.

The simple way would be to exert control over an issuer DID using a
multisig scheme. This would mean that issuance itself is trivial, and so is
the signature block and the revocation handling in the credential; all the
complexity shifts into what generates the signature from the DID
controller. The only DID method that I know of that explici

the signature block and the revocation handling in the credential; all the
complexity shifts into what generates the signature from the DID
controller. The only DID method that I know of that explicitly describes
how to do this today is peer DIDs, but it would not be helpful in VC
issuance, since it isn't anchored to a ledger. Perhaps there are other
methods that support multisig as a verification method, that I'm not aware
of.

The other option is to make issuance itself a multisig process. Some design
work has been completed on this in Hyperledger Ursa discussion circles, but
it's only a little more than whiteboard, AFAIK. This would allow holders to
start with a credential signed by one issuer, and then to go around and
collect endorsements from other issuers until the endorsements hit a
critical mass, at which point the VC becomes valid. There are also some
other usage models it would enable. How revocation would be handled with
such a credential is not obvious, however.

Bottom line is that I think you're asking an important and interesting
question. It's received some attention already, but I don't believe there's
any mature solution yet.

<p>Webinar: DLT Labs &amp; Walmart Use Blockchain to Improve Margins, Visibility &amp; Transparency Throughout the Supply Chain</p>



<p>Tune in at 10:00 a.m. ET on July 15 to hear a presentation from Loudon Owen of DLT Labs on an out-of-the-box platform with configurable modules called Samepaging. Samepaging can integrate with legacy systems and enable two companies looking to share information in order to do business to ensure agreements are being followed. Each participant in the process knows the integrity of the data is inherently accurate and up to date. This improvement to the process enables participants to forecast predictions that directly impact revenue and margins for the entire company. Samepaging is used today, in full production, by Walmart and its national network to improve their supply chain.</p>

<p>Rosalie Dowding interviews Natalie Smolenski, Head of Business Development at Hyland Credentials.</p>
 What do you do? 
Natalie Smolenski
<p>I lead business development for Hyland Credentials, which specializes in verifiable digital credentials using blockchain technology. Until the beginning of this year, we were a separate company called Learning Machine. I’m part of the Learning Machine founding team, so I’ve been here since the very beginning.</p>
<p>Learning Machine itself actually grew out of another company that specialised in admission systems for higher education. Blockcerts came out of conversations we regularly had with admissions offices around the world about the difficulties they regularly have verifying official records. We found they were all keen to see a full portfolio package from each applicant: that means fully validated, verifiable credentials, consolidated official records. That technology didn’t exist yet, so we began working with one of our customers – MIT – to build it. We were pulled in on a research project, at the time called Trustless Transcripts, which later became Blockcerts, or blockchain certificates. We released Blockcerts in 2016 under an MIT open source license.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, we’ve been committed to open standards for digital credentials and digital identity. A standards-based future is essential for establishing a successful digital identity ecosystem. It’s really at the core of our mission – there was no way to scale email or the World Wide Web without interoperable and open standards that everyone can use.</p>
<p>In 2017, Learning Machine went to market with the first product for issuing verifiable credentials at scale. We got quite a bit of customer traction, and in 2020 we were bought by Hyland. It’s been a really wonderful journey – focusing on building the open standards as a company, and then personally taking responsibility for making adoption happen as Head of Business Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Learning Machine has recently been acquired by Hyland – what does this mean? 
<p>There’s been a lot of momentum in the digital identity and credentialing space in recent years, and this really validates that market. Credentialing has been the most mature application of blockchain technology outside of cryptocurrency. In fact, a lot of the large players and multinationals have been developing blockchain credentialing solutions, or saying they’re going to, as are a growing crop of startups.</p>
<p>The Hyland acquisition demonstrates that a large, established software player can find a fruitful partnership with a lean start up like Learning Machine, to deliver a leading-edge solution to its vast portfolio of customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You’ve got a whole range of clients across sectors – so how easy is it to support different companies? 
<p>We were fortunate in when we launched our product back in 2017, as it was the peak of the blockchain hype cycle. That generated a lot of inbound interest from institutions who wanted to learn everything they could about blockchain credentialing. People wanted to see blockchain in action, so I became sort of an educator, explaining the underlying technology, doing demos, and showing how our product could be used for standards-compliant credentialing implementations. All to a really receptive audience. Of course, each institution is slightly different – their priorities will vary, but there’s a lot of commonality in how people learn and metabolise a change in the market like this.</p>
<p>The majority of our customers are in education, because that’s the space we grew out of and where Learning Machine had an established reputation as a brand. However, there are countless adjacent use cases. We’ve grown to having customers around the world, ranging from educational institutions (Higher Ed and K-12) to governments and professional licensing organisations. Ultimately, any document officially issued by a provider could be a verifiable credential; for example, vital records, licenses, passports, and property or land titles/deeds. Right now we’re seeing particular interest from healthcare organisations for things like physician and practitioner credentialing, and even prescriptions or medical records of patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Does that education around blockchain trickle down to the end user? 
<p>There are a number of different categories of end users. For those using the credentialing system (our direct customers), they get trained and onboarded, and then we work closely with them to reach out to the students or civil servants (their “customers”) that are using the credentials. We help our clients educate their end users with anything from emails to webinars to partnering with local organisations or people impacted by the change. There’s a whole range of communication methods that helps all people using or affected by the technology to make sure they understand it.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a whole range of communication methods that helps all people using or affected by the technology to make sure they understand it.</p></blockquote>
 As someone with paper based education certificates, I feel like I really need this 
<p>Haha! Yes, I love to say that I sell what I want, which makes my job so much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What does a normal week look like for you? 
<p>It’s kind of a blessing that I don’t really have a normal week. One day I might be in Malta on customer visits with the Ministry of Education – one of the organisations in the country that we work very closely with. Another week I might be in New York doing a workshop with a multinational organisation or working on a proposal for a major US university school system. The great thing about business development is you fly as fast as you can, so each week can be considerably different to the next.</p>
<p>In this role, you have to very adaptive due to the range of challenges each week. One of the things I learned early on is that being “right” actually doesn’t matter very much – it’s all about communicating in a meaningful way to your audience. People respond as much to who you are as to what you say. If they don’t see you as a partner, as someone who is in this process of transformation together with them, it will be hard to build trust.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s critical in a business development role is that you have your own principles and reason from them, adapting to the cultural context of your audience. Listen to people’s concerns and priorities to find a solution that really works for them. As long as you can forge a joint trajectory that you’re both on, then there’s a path forward together.</p>
<p>An essential part of this is that I never assume that someone I’m talking to shares my vocabulary or understands the context for a particular term or value I hold. So there’s a constant stream of diplomacy underlying my work. It’s kind of a social analogue for open standards being fundamental for establishing common understanding. In my previous life, I was an anthropologist and had to learn multiple languages and cultural idioms. This has come in very handy in my current role.</p>
<blockquote><p>Being “right” actually doesn’t matter very much – it’s all about communicating in a meaningful way to your audience</p></blockquote>
 Do you have to explain the fundamentals of blockchain now? Or do you find people are now starting to understand it more generally? 
<p>In the early days, all people wanted to talk about was, “What is blockchain?” Today, some still want to talk about this, but more people want to talk about the value of blockchain; what problems it can actually solve, rather than concerns about what the technology is. In the same way that most people who use other software applications don’t really care about all the details of what’s going on underneath, they just want to know the features of the service and whether it will make their lives easier or not.</p>
<p>Because we’re in a more mature market today, people often have a better sense for what they want blockchain to do for them. From that I can dissect their business problem and then start working through a solution—if there is one. Blockchain isn’t a panacea; there are many problems it can’t solve, but some things it does extremely well. It’s all about finding if there’s a fit. Today, anything having to do with credentialing is something we can address at Hyland—from issuing the verifiable credential to all the case management work that happens prior to the credential issuance. The products we have are extraordinarily flexible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Were you always interested in technology? 
<p>Both of my parents were software engineers, so I was always around it, but my interests and expertise were in the social sciences. I’m a trained anthropologist, so I’m primarily interested in the social origins and impacts of technologies. One of the things I found really compelling about blockchain is how it’s created this space for experimenting with new governance models, in an era when existing institutions are coming under really intense political scrutiny.</p>
<p>Sovereignty is also fascinating, and was one of the areas of social theory I specialized in during my graduate work. I’m currently working on a research paper on sovereignty in general and self-sovereignty more specifically. When we use these words, what do we mean? For example, how does our understanding of sovereignty affect our view of currency? What would it mean for currency to be de-nationalised (i.e. through Bitcoin)? What would be the implications for the sovereign state and ultimately capitalism? What happens to the form of political economy that we currently live in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 If you were CEO what would you make compulsory and what would you ban? 
<p>My answers to both of these questions have less to do with setting rules than with looking for certain qualities in the character of the people that I would bring onboard.</p>
<p>I would ensure that people in my company are skilled in what they do, or demonstrate a capacity to learn, but most importantly that they have a capacity to work closely with others to achieve a common goal. A number of studies of successful organisations have shown that this ability to work well as part of a team has more impact on a company’s long-term success than even the skills that people have. This is because people who feel safe and in solidarity with the rest of their team are able to move mountains; even top performers’ abilities are amplified when they can rely on their colleagues to have their back. That said, if you’re trying to build cutting-edge technology and successfully take it to market, you do also need to be able to attract and retain top talent. That is why leading these kinds of organizations is no easy task.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who feel safe and in solidarity with the rest of their team are able to move mountains</p></blockquote>
<p>The one thing I would ban is bad faith, by which I mean people who demonstrate they’re engaging in anything other than good faith interactions. Bad faith is toxic regardless of where people are in a hierarchy. Each person in an organisation is a pillar that supports the success of that company. Conflict is natural and often healthy, but bad faith is a character issue that is tenacious and quickly spreads to others. It is fundamentally at odds with solidarity and just needs to be rooted out.</p>
 What book/film/music/art would you recommend to others? 
<p>There are so many, but I would have to say the most extraordinary film I’ve seen in recent years is Arrival. I actually wrote an essay about it because it showed how science can be a diplomatic endeavour. In the film, scientists are deployed to be mediators between humans and a completely alien species. Their patient proximity to the aliens enables them to learn a fundamentally new form of language. The courage of the scientists is especially moving—they could have been killed at any point in the encounter, but they persisted—for everyone’s sake. It’s a film that’s deeply inspired me.</p>

We’ll take a deeper dive into:</p>
 
 the extra security in FAPI-RW 1.0 and FAPI 2.0 
 the security checks done in the certification suites (is this just the FAPI suite or do the OBIE tests cover some security checks?) 
 the security advantages of the OB directory model vs eIDAS

 how the certification programs attempt to ensure both security and interoperability 
 
<p>OIDF and OBIE continue to collaborate to help drive global open banking initiatives with the following goals:</p>
 
 To update participants on the latest developments in both the OIDF Financial-Grade API (FAPI) profile and the OBIE Standard. 
 To demonstrate the respective conformance tools and the benefits of certification including why conformance and certification is critical to ensuring standards are secure and interoperable. 
 To provide participants with help and support in using these tools. 
 To encourage a greater number of certifications. 
 Ultimately to help grow the open banking ecosystem, enhancing security and benefits for participants and end customers.

Gregory Rocco is scribing.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Gregory Rocco works with Wayne on the Spruce 
  team
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Anyone else new to the call that wants to 
  introduce themselves
Tyler Adams:  I work on moonlight and vivid SSI project
Kyle Kemper:  Presenting a little bit - great to be here, founder 
  of Swisskey, crypto since 2013. Technology will help us unlock 
  golden age.
Heather Vescent: Love it Kyle! New golden age, I am with you!
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We'll have another opportunity for intros 
  next week - this is also where we ask for reintroductions. Will 
  jump over the list. Joe Andrieu, Adrian Gropper are you here?
Adrian Gropper:  Volunteer cto of a non-profit, I lead a project 
  for many years trying to demonstrate self sov. technology, not 
  just ID but how we use other standards to let people run their 
  own authorization servers where we process VCs and DIDs

Topic: Announcements &amp; Reminders

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Next is Anil -
Anil John:  Save it for the Q&amp;A
Kaliya Young:  John jordan was in a bad accident, I created a 
  virtual card for folks to sign - will put the link in the chat
Kaliya Young: <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kp34wZs=/">https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kp34wZs=/</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy: <a href="http://www.cvent.com/d/fhqnf3/4W">http://www.cvent.com/d/fhqnf3/4W</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you, sorry to hear about that 
  accident. For the other announcements and reminders, I'm 
  including a link where we track - not a whole lot going on but we 
  do have Identiverse which turned into a virtual conference and 
  that series began in June and is going through the 6th of August. 
  So in case you are still interested in participating, joining the 
  link is here.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Our other ongoing reminders: usual CCG 
  timeslot, we do have a couple of taskforces associated but the 
  first one is the VC for Education taskforce which is at mondays 
  8am PST, 11 EST, DID resolution calls are at 1PM PST, 4PM EST.

Topic: Progress on Action Items

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  That's it for the announcements and 
  reminders - next in the agenda, we have a bit on products and 
  action items.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action%3A+review+next%22">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action%3A+review+next%22</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  So progress on action items - a couple we're 
  working through. I'll include a link to it in IRC - there are two 
  items and we're hoping to move through these quickly. Basically 
  we don't need to resolve these, just identify blockers and figure 
  out any steps.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/109">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/109</a>
Manu Sporny: +1 That item belongs to DID WG.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Issue #109: closed out, issue there is that 
  the CCG believes this is going to be passed over to the DID 
  working group and so it looks like we just want confirmation that 
  it belongs to that group and we can close it.
Manu Sporny:  It's confirmed that it's on Dan B's plate from the 
  DID working group and we'll be handing that over to the wg so 
  they can finish that off to get the tech/architecture group 
  input.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/3">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/3</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I've added a comment and will follow up. 
  Next item: complete update to RSA signature suite. We had a bit 
  of a discussion, what we wanted to do - no traction on the work 
  item but we identified a related issue to create a new issue. 
  Effectively what manu proposed: specific concerns around JWS 2020 
  so the current proposal is to close this one and create a new one 
  to track those concerns. Thoughts or objections?
Kaliya Young:  I was on q for announcements for jj
Orie Steele: Related: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/lds-jws2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/lds-jws2020</a>
Orie Steele: It covers the NIST curves and ed25519 and secp256k1
Manu Sporny:  Right so the RSA sig suite discussion resulted in 
  Orie proposing a JWS signature suite like a jose signature suite, 
  that discussion will likely happen in a DID special topic call - 
  we need to figure out how we're going to integrate that with --- 
  used for expressing legacy signature suite, RSA, things like that 
  b26r1, if anyone's interested in participating -- based on the 
  outcome of that, we may want to discuss the outcome of that in 
  the communit[CUT]
Manu Sporny:  Not this week but next week we'll have a special 
  topic announced - outcome of call will be made public, CCG will 
  decide if they want to discuss the outcome.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I will add an update to this issue and we 
  will follow up.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Okay great - that is it for action items
Wayne Chang: 
  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jun/0203.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jun/0203.html</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jun/0203.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jun/0203.html</a>
Wayne Chang: Call for objections sent almost 2 weeks ago
Kim Hamilton Duffy:   Before we move into the meat of the call, 
  want to talk about method registry - we moved it over to the DID 
  working group and that means we're retiring it from CCG - so 
  Wayne sent a call for objections two weeks ago. Wayne - what was 
  the deadline?
Wayne Chang:  I think it was almost two weeks - if there's no 
  objections, we're clear.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Last call for objections - we have not 
  received anything so far so we can proceed with closing it out so 
  we'll move forward.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  If you heard some choppy audio, in addition 
  to our communication issues we had a gremlin muting speakers. We 
  should remind everyone if you can speak clearly and slowly, that 
  would help a lot. Now we are ready for the roundtable
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I'm going to ask Wayne to set up 
  expectations for discussion

Topic: Roundtable: “What’s in a wallet?” Part 1

Wayne Chang:  Basically, we are growing as an ecosystem, whenever 
  that happens you run the risk of people talking over each other - 
  just going on guidelines will help us have productive discussions 
  to get to outcomes we like instead of flame wars.
Wayne Chang: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/140</a>
Wayne Chang:  There's a bunch of emotional energy spent - how do 
  we keep the conversation on track. We opened this communication 
  culture issue and we captured 4 links so far - just some reading 
  material, just some good social guidelines to follow rather than 
  people showing off deep intellect and to be kind to one another.
Wayne Chang:  Just to cherry pick: some social rules: no "well 
  actually" - when you try to make a point and someone wants to nit 
  pick that's tangential and serves no purpose. That doesn't move 
  anything forward. No surprise - especially for newcomers, also 
  subtleisms - avoid - if you're trying to make an example, think 
  carefully and make sure the analogies are extensible and 
  welcoming. These are some examples of behaviors to avoid as a 
  community - no hard and[CUT]
Wayne Chang:  Last of all, let's try to listen to listen - I hope 
  that sets a pretty good headspace for everyone to be in this 
  week.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you Wayne - we have 4 speakers today, 
  Manu, Chris, Dan, Kyle K - each are scheduled for 5 minutes with 
  the remainder for Q&amp;A. So I'm going to kick off Manu - i'll be 
  aggressively booting people off after 5 min.
Manu Sporny:  Thanks Kim - and thanks to the chairs for the 
  invitation. I apologize, the diagram I put together is overly 
  technical so I'm going to ground the discussion a bit.
Manu Sporny:  There are many different views - what it is, what 
  it does, some people think of wallets like cryptocurrency and 
  they deal with cryptographic material, others think of them in an 
  analog to your physical wallet. You keep credit cards, loyalty 
  cards, you know, pieces of paper that are important for you when 
  interacting with the world.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Manu's diagram fyi: 
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y6zKKm3hGVL6Z9cRfDGQvLXxHBE79ODw/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y6zKKm3hGVL6Z9cRfDGQvLXxHBE79ODw/view?usp=sharing</a>
Manu Sporny:  Many different variations in between - there's no 
  clear understanding about what is, what isn't, and what a digital 
  wallet should and shouldn't do. I'm going to outline standards 
  that in pre-standards work that we've been doing here as well as 
  work in the DIF storage working group in a tech architecture kind 
  of way. Apologies to the non-technical or those not following the 
  work.
Manu Sporny:  What I'm getting to is a simple wallet 
  architecture: from my perspective: a wallet is something that you 
  use that is digital, on mobile phone/in web browser, holds 
  digital things (pictures, your ID docs, your dependents 
  healthcare certs,), it stores that for you, it's yours, you 
  control access to the information, and basically you use it to 
  manage critical parts of digital life.
Manu Sporny: 
  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jul/att-0006/2020_W3C_CCG_Simple_Wallet_Architecture.pdf">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jul/att-0006/2020_W3C_CCG_Simple_Wallet_Architecture.pdf</a>
Manu Sporny:  At a high-level - one definition we can use - I'm 
  sharing the link in the chat to a diagram I sent yesterday around 
  what these things that make up a wallet look like. These are the 
  technical bits and pieces that we've been working on and how 
  they're used together to provide this digital wallet experience. 
  To interact with issuers, verifiers, etc.
Manu Sporny:  There are three components that we've identified - 
  number of companies in this group that have done work around 
  encrypted data vaults that have wallet front-end services and 
  have some kind of key management - there are three pieces.
Manu Sporny:  First - the one we all interact with - the wallet 
  service. It's a website, an app, has buttons you click on and 
  basically interact-with. This is the GUI to manage the digital 
  things in your wallet. That's the lowest purple box - we use 
  something called a credential handler API to move things in and 
  out of your wallet -
Dave Longley: Credential Handler API == "CHAPI"
Manu Sporny:  The wallet is backed by two other things - the 
  wallet facade is in the front, but behind the scenes: 1. key 
  service - this is what deals with your pub priv keys and gives 
  you the security you need around the wallet. Public private 
  cryptography backed by hardware modules that are difficult to 
  compromise so there's a digital signature aspect of the wallet 
  and you get access via web kms service.
Dmitri Zagidulin: For those interested in CHAPI - this repo has 
  link to the CHAPI spec, as well as demo sites: 
  <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/credential-handler-polyfill">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/credential-handler-polyfill</a>
Orie Steele: I wish WebAuthN supported raw signatures... and 
  could be used for things other than authentication.
Dmitri Zagidulin: Encrypted Data Vault spec (as part of the 
  Secure Data Store spec) - 
  <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/</a>
Manu Sporny:  And then the other thing behind the scenes is the 
  encrypted data vault: the thing that stores and protects the data 
  from prying eyes and ensures consent. Those encrypted data vaults 
  hold aspects of your life -credentials that you need for work, 
  music that you listen to but you keep in another vault, and maybe 
  one for family photos in another. We use the vault api to get to 
  it
Manu Sporny:  In it's most simplistic view, that is the 
  fundamental technical part that goes into a wallet and 
  more-or-less how we view the most basic form of wallet.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you so much - chris you're up
Christopher Allen: 
  <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/whats-wallet.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/whats-wallet.md</a>
Christopher Allen: 
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/master/topics-and-advance-readings/media/ExpandedDecentralizedIdentityNetworkComponents.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/master/topics-and-advance-readings/media/ExpandedDecentralizedIdentityNetworkComponents.png</a>
Christopher Allen:  So i'm sharing the general paper that this 
  came from and I'm now sharing the very specific diagram in there.
Christopher Allen:  Basically I wanted to walk folks through this 
  diagram to explain what we're trying to do and say what we felt 
  was missing - Joe and I initially took a look at a simplified 
  diagram around digital ID wallets which is included in the paper, 
  and then also we tried to do the same for digital currency 
  wallets and basically developed a more advanced look at both of 
  those because a lot of the things are common but areas where 
  they're different.
Christopher Allen:  What you see here: a lot of nodes and 
  different aspects of what is in your wallet, clearly toward the 
  center you see what people perceive as the wallet (going down - 
  human interfaces, trusted interfaces to hardware - need to trust 
  we're getting the right information) - upward we have various 
  kinds of storage and relationships that the wallet needs to do
Christopher Allen:  Then we have this red line: the trust line 
  where the wallet has to trust cryptographic surfaces through API, 
  airgapped, but that line needed to be marked as important that 
  leads to cryptographic services under control of the wallet and 
  then of course going right as we go toward network interface, we 
  have a trust surface of the wallet's network interface to the 
  broader network.
Ryan Grant: Sorry, the dottet lines represent what?  the gremlin 
  cut you off.
Christopher Allen:  Dotted lines represent ---- API that there 
  was state information or other information being conveyed whether 
  or not it was a proof - or things that weren't strictly an API. 
  Had hoped to take this to the next level, felt that a number of 
  these nodes were named differently by different platforms in the 
  self-sov community, some of these nodes should be 2-3 stacked 
  items with different names as a stack.
Christopher Allen:  I am also fairly certain and know that we're 
  missing nodes and anything in here about 
  recovery/revocation/delegation/reputation/onboarding/TOU, various 
  kinds of evaluative components, and updates and pricing - if 
  you're going to have a cryptocurrency thing in here. We had hoped 
  we can get 1-each from the different wallet vendors on different 
  SSI platforms to help us take this to the next level but also 
  start naming the arrows. We didn't [CUT]
Christopher Allen:   Was a mistake - we needed to name the arrows 
  as well as defining the nodes - that's where we left the project.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thanks so much - now we have dan b
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Need to come back to him - kyle would you be 
  ready to go
Kyle Kemper:  Alright - thank you kim for having me and first 
  off, want to say big thank-you to this community who is 
  developing the core infrastructure on which this tech will play 
  out. My name is Kyle Kemper - been in crypto since 2013, in 2015 
  I had my wallet vision download around what will be truly 
  possible when we have SSI and have self-custody wallets that are 
  unified.
Kyle Kemper:  I wrote a book called "unified wallet" - it's a 
  vision on how we can unlock seamless experiences. Personally I'm 
  not a deeply technical person, I am a developer - my journey has 
  brought me to the point where I'm building a brand called 
  SwissKey - problem in the ecosystem of trust.
Kyle Kemper:  Closely aligned (digtial currency and ID), currency 
  is the cash slip and the card slots are the verified claims, 
  assets, objects in our super wallets. Been building swisskey for 
  the last year being in switzerland and being impressed with their 
  values and sensibilities - hallmarks of neutrality, and their 
  strong and subliminal messages -
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Daniel said he was muted fyi. Have we muted 
  him here?
Kyle Kemper:  It represents safety at the subliminal level - I'm 
  seeking to build out a suite of wallet products to enable 
  secure/simply operate in this new digital paradigm. We are going 
  to be holding keys for different solutions be it money, identity, 
  loyalty. I am grateful to be here to express this project that 
  I'm working on and make myself available to everyone on the call. 
  I feel we all share this transformational purpose.
Kyle Kemper:  Make this all accessible to the masses.
Wayne Chang:  Hey kyle - really quickly, the topic is what is a 
  wallet - wanted to leave some room for that.
Daniel Buchner: Hey Kim
Daniel Buchner: On IRC now
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Hi Daniel, we found the culprit. You 
  shouldn't have to do anything to unmute. We unblocked you
Manu Sporny: <a href="https://swisskey.io/">https://swisskey.io/</a>
Kyle Kemper:  In terms of the technical path, I'm working with 
  edge wallet, and then we are working with Tangem who are the 
  makers of a hardware wallet, NFC card, they're exploring into the 
  ID space so we can have a physical card as well - the digital 
  wallet is important but there's a need for hard cards. These 
  represent the "DVDs" for netflix.
Kyle Kemper:  That's basically kind of it from me in terms of 
  this - thank you - I yield back my time.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you so much, now we figured out the 
  root of the issue - we muted daniel - can you try to speak.
Daniel Buchner:  Dan Buchner, work at Microsoft. We have a wallet 
  in the market doing legacy identity things like logins, etc. 30M 
  users on that current app and that's what we're delivering some 
  of our stuff with (DID) - so users have keys
Daniel Buchner:  Part of the aspiration is to create portability 
  specs so you can re-instantiate it on other wallets. 3 
  components: 1. encrypted outer envelope: data you need to encrypt 
  needs multiple types of encryption strategies, shamir, whatever 
  you want to do to secure it. 2. There's a lot of data over time 
  in this payload - need to make it something that isn't 100s of 
  MBs of JSON. Something that can be inflated and understood.
Daniel Buchner:  What goes into that payload may include things 
  like keys but context as well. Context to use your DIDs in - many 
  people might think "well, good enough to have keys for DID and 
  re-instantiate" but context is a sensitive security thing to 
  protect, but if I had 1000 DIDs and didn't know what I used them 
  for, I would be lost.
Daniel Buchner:  If I just use random DIDs with people, I would 
  slowly be leaking sensitive context and relationships with 
  people. Whatever we do should be able to handle that goal. Those 
  are the major pieces we hope to standardize and we're here to 
  work with folks on that.
Manu Sporny: +1 To what Daniel said! :)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Fantastic, thank you so much -we've gone 
  through our speakers and it's good time for Q&amp;A
Kyle Kemper: <a href="mailto:Kylejjkemper@gmail.com?Subject=Re%3A%20%5BMINUTES%5D%20W3C%20Credentials%20CG%20Call%20-%202020-07-07%2012pm%20ET&amp;In-Reply-To=%3C5f076ba6.1c69fb81.615d7.8812%40mx.google.com%3E&amp;References=%3C5f076ba6.1c69fb81.615d7.8812%40mx.google.com%3E">Kylejjkemper@gmail.com</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Any questions - just add yourself
Kyle Kemper: <a href="http://swisskey.io">http://swisskey.io</a>
Kyle Kemper: My mission: make crypto and DID accessible to the 
  masses
Wayne Chang:  So I wanted to summarize a bit and people feel free 
  to type in the chat. We heard "what is a wallet" - we heard a 
  bunch of different perspectives - interfaces to capabilities and 
  mapping - what's that. Philosophically, what does a wallet make 
  someone feel or how is it used by a person - and what are the 
  technical requirements we have on scalability and security.
Wayne Chang:  Common thread: interfaces and the ability to make 
  components for these interfaces. Also mention what prompted this 
  conversation was the recent presentation of what was called the 
  universal wallet spec by Ori at Transmute - as we begin to see 
  these emergent standards - that's all the comments I have.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We have adrian
Orie Steele: Good question :)
Adrian Gropper:  Quick comment - I am certainly a user not a 
  developer, I'm trying to figure out the business model as what 
  are essential vs. optional. My question: how is a SSI wallet 
  going to differ from my 1Password wallet which right now is the 
  closest in terms of business models and functionality as far as I 
  can tell - in other words, has a lot of characteristics plus APIs 
  and it's self sov to a large extent because it doesn't share 
  data.
Kyle Kemper: If interested go to <a href="https://dl.edge.app/swisskey">https://dl.edge.app/swisskey</a> to 
  download Edge Wallet; we are working with Edge to rebrand their 
  wallet...
Heather Vescent: Great question Adrian
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Did any speakers have a response to that? If 
  more than one we'll let the first person go.
Kyle Kemper:  In terms of the business model in the self 
  sovereign wallet they all speak to our project and we are making 
  revenues when people are buying and selling crypto, trading, 
  redeeming - we're selling the physical cards as well - we're 
  going to be utilizing the physical cards as recovery methods - 
  comparing a 1Pass or a LastPass to the wallet, those are 
  excellent examples of keychains but they're dumb. The assets 
  can't speak to each other
Daniel Buchner: We hope wallets are as free and open as browsers, 
  and should cost users $0 to run (possibly with sane constraints 
  for consumption, if there are any major cost incurrences)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I'm talking with the chairs about 
  key-management was going to call out Christopher and Manu or if 
  they wanted to respond.
Kyle Kemper: Wallets definitely need to be free
Christopher Allen:  I'm actually fairly concerned about wallets - 
  I feel that a lot of the business models for them are subtly 
  corrupting in the cryptocurrency field or selling some hardware 
  or you're making your money from accepting a particular 
  cryptocurrency so you'll get 100-200k if you do some oddball 
  currency.
Manu Sporny: +1 To the corrupting influence of cryptocurrency 
  wallets :)
Dave Longley: "Free" has a cost :)
Dave Longley: "Facebook" is "free"
Daniel Buchner: Wallets, DID Networks, and other core infra/UA 
  stuff should be so mind-numbingly commoditized as public 
  utilities, it should cost you more to monetize them than you 
  would make in doing so
Christopher Allen:  Or you'll get a bunch of tokens from a 
  company that you can speculate with and turn into a return. I 
  worry about that trend happening in our environment - right now 
  every platform developer has their own wallet to incentivize 
  their own DIDs and VCs scenarios but people aren't going to want 
  to have 8 of these wallets - people want 1 wallet that works with 
  Sov, Ion, DIDWeb and whatever else that their vendors/issuers 
  want them to use.
Christopher Allen:  That makes for a difficult business model for 
  the wallet vendor at the bottom - if you look at my diagram, 
  there's a lot of pieces so it's not like a wallet is an easy 
  thing to build.
Moses Ma: Can someone compile a list of DID-friendly open source, 
  templates and reference wallets that developers can review?
Daniel Buchner: Just so freaking, absurdly open and cheap that 
  it's not even something we consider trying to squeeze $ from
Christopher Allen:  You're building 3 layers - trustable layer 
  for security implications, --- i'm concerned.
Kyle Kemper: Agree on all points...listing fees are definitely an 
  issue and creates gatekeepers...how do we allow tokens and 
  projects to freely list themselves vs paying to play
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  So we can work through questions 30 second 
  replies is the going-amount. What we'll do - we'll work through 
  the q in order.
Phil Long:  Thank you kim - curious about what the community 
  thinks or what the presenter thinks are the minimum viable 
  functions, and the distinction between OSS and value added 
  services layer that take advantage of the contents of wallets 
  with the consent of the owner.
Dave Longley: Dbuc, just want to make sure we're wary of wallets 
  becoming like facebook wrt data model (that would represent the 
  antithesis of the work here, IMO)
Kyle Kemper: Send, Receive, Request, Transaction History, 
  Recoverability...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you phil -
Daniel Buchner: Sure, definitely not surveillance wallets
Daniel Buchner: That's a given
Daniel Buchner: I just mean that it should be like Firefox
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm doing tech research - dan can answer first as 
  most active wallet. What are the most compelling reasons 
  individuals will adopt wallets.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Dan if you add to q
Orie Steele:  Wanted to respond to adrian's question around 
  password managers - they're the most familiar analogy for storing 
  credentials (in this case logins) - I think structurally if you 
  look at their business models, a lot of them have similar 
  structures to Manu's diagrams with encrypted data vault - they 
  rely on client-side encrypt, they have various different data 
  model structures for storage and that's a point of 
  differentiation - some of them support [CUT]
Orie Steele:  Some structure data. A lot of them charge for 
  multi-device replication, I think password managers are an 
  excellent thing to consider when we think about what wallets are 
  and how they integrate with other systems
Manu Sporny: +1 To Orie's point on a good analog.
Anil John:  My organization is investing in these things - 
  standardized APIs, goodness of a wallet but what I didn't hear 
  about is the user experience of a wallet. One of the things - we 
  like putting time and pressure behind consent, we are having a 
  competition for user interfaces for wallets. How do you interact 
  with issuer, selective disclosure, presentations - so from UI 
  perspective, focus is on that. Is that something that is going to 
  be of value t[CUT]
Anil John:  Confidence in transaction and user-comfort is 
  important. Is there value in putting money where our mouth is.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I'm excited that you're doing that, if you 
  have comments add to q
Orie Steele: Interesting to note that password manager have 
  "autofill" feature... and CHAPI has a similar functionality for 
  send credentials from the wallet to the websites.
Christopher Allen: I'd like to see a formal information 
  information lifecycle model created for wallets to start a UX 
  requirements
Moses Ma: Again, can the chairs arrange to have someone compile a 
  list of DID-friendly open source, templates and reference wallets 
  that developers can review? My belief aligns with Daniel's... a 
  wallet is a feature, not a product.
Daniel Buchner:  I think there's a variety of reasons re: use 
  cases that identity is still a powerful - we don't charge for 
  wallets or snoop on your stuff - we own a few properties like 
  LinkedIn that would benefit from people creating credentials and 
  exchanging them. Adding that level of trust helps those 
  properties - imagine if recruiter tools said for $1 more we can 
  scan trusted profiles that have the right credentials.
Daniel Buchner:  That's valuable to microsoft - we don't care 
  about monetize, we just want stuff that happens on top of it. 
  This is why we do this for free and not do the thing that other 
  companies do.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thanks daniel -
Manu Sporny:  Wanted to add to dan and adrians question - what's 
  the nearest analog? Password managers are very good analogies and 
  that's good, the thing that makes what we're doing here different 
  is the standards. No interop between password managers - can't 
  move information between them. One key thing is the interop 
  standards where you can move contents from one wallet to another 
  without it being a disruption in your work life.
Manu Sporny:  So again, not surprisingly standards are the key 
  binding characteristic that makes this different.
Orie Steele: +1 To standards and interoperability
Drummond Reed: +1 To full portability between wallets from 
  different vendors / projects
Manu Sporny: +1 To rocco
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  And I have a special callout - we want to 
  thank Rocco for his excellent note-taking -
Ryan Grant: +1
Wayne Chang: +1 Rocco
Heather Vescent: +1 Rocco thanks for scribing!
Markus Sabadello: +1
Mike Prorock: What is the best way to address wallet usage by non 
  technical users? e.g. we work extensively with users that have 
  limited access to tech and sometimes limited literacy rates, but 
  they have smart phones.... have thoughts been put into those 
  types of usability issues?
Drummond Reed: +1
Dave Longley: +1
Christopher Allen: +1 To scribe
Anil John: +1
Phil Long: +1 Rocco
Dmitri Zagidulin: +1 Thanks rocco!
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you for all the speakers for this 
  excellent conversation, thank you and ahve a good day.
Kyle Kemper: +1 Rocco post your doge address
Tim Bouma: +1 Rocco
Moses Ma: Bye peeps
Heather Vescent: Thanks Manu.
Heather Vescent: We have another set of speakers for next week.
Manu Sporny: +1 To that, expect turnout will be about the same, 
  feels like we're just scratching the surface.

 Today, ID2020 announced its newest Alliance partner, the National Cybersecurity Center&nbsp;(NCC). <p>ID2020 was founded in 2016 to ensure that all people have access to better forms of digital ID, bringing together nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by the former Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC) is a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit committed to promoting cyber innovation and awareness.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome the National Cybersecurity Center to the ID2020 Alliance,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “Because technology is evolving so quickly, many of the transactions that once took place in person and required traditional forms of ID are today being conducted digitally. Cyber threats, whether criminal or state-state sponsored, underscore the urgency and importance of ID2020 and the NCC’s collective efforts. We look forward to sharing our expertise and learning from their world-class team of cybersecurity experts.”</blockquote><p>With a mission to “secure the world”, the NCC has four main initiatives:</p><p>● Secure the Vote seeks to increase voter confidence in the U.S. on the accuracy of vote-counting, and to generate greater awareness of possible solutions to critical gaps in the voting infrastructure. Secure the Vote supports jurisdictions’ efforts to offer a secure, auditable mobile voting option for overseas voters through coordinating, and evaluating pilots across the&nbsp;country.</p><p>● Secure Smart Cities: Hyper-connectivity amongst smart devices and urbanization drive the need for cities to become more efficient in their operations as they continue to grow, but the concern of security impedes the overall advancement of several cities with “Smart”&nbsp;agendas.</p><p>● The NCC’s Cyber Education Program provides cybersecurity leadership, and one of the main pillars is K-12 education. As our nation addresses the critical gap in skilled cybersecurity talent, NCC addresses the importance of cyber education through programs and partnerships that invite students to participate in an ecosystem that encourages them to learn, explore, and build their&nbsp;skills.</p><p>○ The NCC’s K-12 initiative, the National Cybersecurity Center Student Alliance (NCCSA) offers opportunities for middle and high school students to improve technical literacy through fun, interactive, and challenging camps, field trips, workshops, and events. NCC encourages STEM education for all students, with special attention towards creating inviting and collaborative opportunities for girls and other underrepresented groups in the cyber ecosystem.</p><p>● The Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a separate nonprofit organization, has the mission to facilitate collaboration across the global space industry to enhance our ability to prepare for and respond to vulnerabilities, incidents, and threats; to disseminate timely and actionable information among member entities; and to serve as the primary communications channel for the sector with respect to this information.</p><blockquote>“Digital citizenship is an increasingly critical space as more of our identity is online,” said NCC Director of Business and Government Initiatives, Forrest Senti. “The NCC’s work to secure cyberspace intersects directly with ID2020’s work to protect individuals’ online identity and to ensure that policies created around that protection are fair and equitable and ensure the utmost security for citizens around the world. We look forward to working with ID2020 to pioneer new ways to secure the future of identity.”</blockquote><p>The future of digital ID is at an important crossroads. As policymakers in the US and around the world struggle to confront the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, some are considering plans for digital identity-based health credentials to facilitate a return to work, school, and other social activities. The risks to privacy and security are high, as are the rewards of doing it right. ID2020 is working urgently with its partners and other stakeholders to ensure that privacy and data security are built into the technical architecture of these systems and that the appropriate legislative and regulatory are developed to guide their implementation.</p><p>ID2020 and the National Cybersecurity Center share a common mission to secure our individual and collective privacy and security. We welcome them to the Alliance and look forward to working collaboratively to advance our shared&nbsp;goals.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions. By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.ID2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About National Cybersecurity Center</p><p>Established in 2016, The National Cybersecurity Center exists to help secure the world using knowledge, connections, and resources to solve global cybersecurity challenges and develop a protected cyber ecosystem. An independent and non-profit think tank based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the NCC provides cyber innovation and awareness and is a leader in cyber education, workforce development, and informing public&nbsp;policy.</p><p><a href="http://www.cyber-center.org">www.cyber-center.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-welcomes-the-national-cybersecurity-center-to-the-alliance-a8af0261e69f">ID2020 Welcomes the National Cybersecurity Center to the Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite, LoginWithFIDO.com, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers. As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers – the results of which we’ll be sharing on this webinar. Join us to see the findings from our research and to learn how you may be able to utilize the data for your own FIDO offerings and/or deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to hear:&nbsp;</p>



  How many different passwords consumers really use for their online accounts  What tactics they use for password management and how often they are resetting passwords and&nbsp;  Their familiarity with various types of authentication technologies including SMS OTPs, biometrics and others  The types of apps and services where consumers most want to use FIDO  How consumers want to be communicated with about FIDO at enrollment and login  



<p>We will also give the audience a detailed look at LoginWithFIDO.com and how you can consider using it for your own educational initiatives around FIDO. You’ll learn:</p>



  How to navigate through the microsite and its two landing pages  How you can reference the site and its materials for your own offerings and deployments  Added insights into how to utilize FIDO’s consumer-facing marks

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Peer Social?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://peer.social">Peer Social</a> is a team of dedicated decentralists who are researching and developing new architectures and technologies to solve some of the most pressing problems of our time—starting with social media. We are committed to eliminating the dynamic of user exploitation, which has become commonplace on the social internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social networks and centralized Cloud service providers require users to agree to terms which include giving up control of their personal data in return for using their network or service. They use this agreement as a blanket authorization to host, track and store, their users’ online activities and behaviours. The <a href="https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/">Surveillance Capitalism</a> business model represents the worst excesses of the social Internet—we are here to change it.</p>



<p>Over the past 2 years we have assembled a super-talented team of security architects, designers, developers, and some of the world’s best academic researchers to build a secure, distributed, mobile networking app, which allows users to create their own private network (using a secure blockchain)—it’s called <a href="https://peer.social/manyone/">Manyone</a>. Manyone is a safe, digital environment where users control their personal information, connections, and unique personas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to fix content moderation, content hosting, and the ownership problems of today’s social Internet by giving users decentralized ownership and control of their data. We want everyone to have a self-sovereign, self-hosted, digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



 <a href="https://peer.social/"></a> 



<p>2. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users having a real, verifiable, trusted, digital identity solution is the ambition of every person, country and every business. Enabling one true digital identity for every human would improve access to services like healthcare, government, and banking by uncoupling this access from traditional identity issuers—this would give the under-privileged and under-banked the ability to establish their own unique digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economies around the world, including Canada, are going to need to rebuild quickly. Imagine a world where all people had their own self-sovereign digital identity. By establishing immutable links to every citizen at the individual level—we would remove the friction (measured in both time and money) associated with accessing online services/support. Digital access that is efficient, secure, and convenient for everyone is key in helping rebuild and transform economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How does your organization address the needs of this&nbsp;transformation? </p>



<p>Peer Social focuses on an increasingly important component to any digital identity architecture by enabling true, verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any individual user, business or government wanting to create a self-sovereign digital identity can do so by recording it on a personal blockchain and securely sharing it with other people and institutions over a private distributed network.</p>



<p>We aim to deliver the simplest, yet most powerful, self-sovereign, verified, decentralized digital identity platform we can for our users.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have as a leader in this space?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada is in a unique position to take a leadership role in the global digital identity market by already possessing a foundation of ‘trust’—essential for any successful solution. Brand Canada has a lot of admirers around the world and it is easy to imagine a robust and cutting edge, Canadian-built digital identity solution gaining wide acceptance at a global level.</p>



<p>In today’s world, Canadians are more likely to trust a self-sovereign, digital identity solution that is architected and built in Canada. In fact, a digital identity solution produced in Canada is more likely to be accepted as a global standard due to Canada’s reputation as a fair and open society.</p>



<p>5. Why did your Peer Social join the DIACC and what else should we know about your organization?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peer Social joined DIACC to become more engaged (at the policy level) in the Canadian digital identity conversation. We live in interesting times, where a lot of attention is being paid to digital identity and how to produce the best solution to meet the needs of traditional identity issuers like banks and governments—while still respecting individual users’ civil liberties. Joining DIACC is a great way to connect and listen to what others have to say—as well as add our voice to the discussion.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on <a href="https://peer.social">Peer Social</a>. We are launching our first generation, decentralized, self-sovereign, digital identity mobile App, <a href="https://peer.social/manyone/">Manyone</a>, very soon— allowing each of us to take our first steps towards a self-sovereign, digital future.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director at the FIDO Alliance, offers an update on the group’s efforts to reduce reliance on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inforisktoday.com/identity-access-management-c-446">passwords</a>&nbsp;and discusses how to overcome barriers.</p>



<p>In the next phase of the effort, developers will start building websites that can support the FIDO2 standards. “The Web authentication protocol and the FIDO2 standards, for the first time, present an open, public API that any developer can use to add FIDO to their site,” he explains.</p>



<p>In a video interview with Information Security Media Group, Shikiar discusses:</p>



  How the alliance is working to reduce the reliance on passwords;  FIDO’s efforts to educate consumers;  The barriers to establishing a password-free environment – and how to overcome them.  



<p>Shikiar is the executive director and chief marketing officer at the FIDO Alliance, a global consortium working to create open standards and an interoperable ecosystem for simpler, stronger user authentication. He previously led market development efforts for the Tizen Association, the LiMo Foundation and the Liberty Alliance Project.</p>

         <a>Hello Everyone,

A reminder that that the (single) application deadline for this funding opportunity closes on Friday, 10 July 2020 @ 12:00 PM PT.
I am attaching a copy of the slides that were used during the Industry Day webcast as an FYI (You can also find them on the official application website)
As we requested during that event and in many other venues, if your network touches relevant technology startups and founders in Black, LatinX and underserved communities of color, I would very much appreciate if you could share this opportunity with them. The SVIP "business model" does not take startup equity or IP (see industry day slides for more details) which often tends to be a concern of both startup founders and their commercial investors.  While we do not have quotas or dedicated funding for those communities, we are fiercely dedicated to ensuring that EVERY APPLICANT gets evaluated on the same level playing field!

Subject: DHS S&amp;T SVIP Call (Re-Release) || Blockchain/DLT/SSI Solutions to Prevent Forgery &amp; Counterfeiting of Certificates and Licenses

Hello Everyone,
We have re-opened the DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) Call for Blockchain/DLT/SSI solutions i.e. Funding Opportunity for Startups, with additional problem sets that are being faced by our Operational Components and Programs.
This work will be both separate (different problem sets &amp; in one case a different problem sponsor) and similar (we are building on top of, and doubling down on, the very real standards based interoperability work that has already been accomplished and demonstrated by the original cohort of companies that we awarded contracts to).
While members of the original cohort that remain part of the program will continue to focus on their product build out in Phase 2, we are seeking additional companies to address additional problem sets. To find out more, please take a look at the details below and our full solicitation.
As an FYI, the Virtual Industry Day is an opportunity to get your questions (both business and technical) answered, before you decide whether or not to apply to the program.
We hope that you will consider working with us to enable an ecosystem that contains a pluralism of operators and technologies, is truly interoperable and diverse, and prevents technology and vendor lock-in.
Best Regards,

Anil

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), on behalf of DHS Operational Components and Programs, invests in startup companies from across the nation and around the world to adapt, develop and harness cutting-edge capabilities that are commercially sustainable while simultaneously meeting the needs of DHS.

Decentralized and distributed registry and time-stamping implementations such as Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), from a government perspective, holds the potential for enhanced transparency and auditing of public service operations, greater visibility into multi-party business operations, and automation of paper-based processes to improve delivery of services to organizations and citizens.
DHS Operational Components and Programs,  such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the DHS Privacy Office (PRIV) have common needs across their mission sets for the use of interoperable implementations of these technologies that also support the growth and availability of a competitive marketplace of diverse technology implementations for government and industry to draw upon to deliver cost effective and innovative solutions.
This SVIP Call i.e. Product Development Funding Opportunity for Startup Companies, is seeking solutions that apply decentralized identifiers and resilient registries to the issuance and verification of identifiers and credentials in order to enhance their security, while employing privacy respecting mechanisms that implement standards based multi-platform interoperability.
It reflects the needs of DHS Operational Components and Programs, with applicants expected to use one or more of following DHS specific scenarios to frame their applications:

  *   Alternative Identifier to the Social Security Number (PRIV)
  *   Food Supply Chain Safety and Visibility (CBP)
  *   Supply Chain Traceability of Natural Gas Imports (CBP)
  *   Supply Chain Traceability of Direct-to-Consumer E-Commerce Shipments (CBP)
  *   Privacy Respecting Essential Work and/or Task License (USCIS)

Andy Miller IMS Global - supporting CLR &amp; Open Badges, etc.
Jim Kelly - Formerly ECE, currently ind. consultant and chair of 
  PESC board, was tech advisor on ILE (now LER) Wrapper spec
Victoria - competency-based digital credentials, help 
  international applicants to reduce process time
Kerri Lemoie will talk about recent US ED report
  ...

Topic: US Dept of Education Blockchain in Education Report

Kerri Lemoie:  Project part of phase 1 of Ed Blockchain project
Kerri Lemoie:  What is going in in the ecosystem to inform a 
  challenge, to be launched soon
Kerri Lemoie:  40 Entities/experts interviews, lit review, online 
  research
Kerri Lemoie:  Findings - 70 active initiatives, many in pilot 
  stages, many academic and digital credentials, blockcerts
Joshua Marks: I was supposed to scribe today, but got waylaid. 
  WHo is scribing?
Kerri Lemoie:  Newer efforts using hyper-ledger, portfolios, CVs, 
  prof. evaluations, identity protection, etc.
Kerri Lemoie:  This is a top priority - many understand this is 
  important, and 2nd big theme was life-long-learning
Kerri Lemoie:  3Rd theme - connecting ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Many credentials not being used, need more success 
  in leveraging power of connected ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Underuse of digital credentials...lot of issuing, 
  not use
Kerri Lemoie:  Questions remain - what does it mean to control?
Kerri Lemoie:  Digital divide - 29% dont't have smart phones, 46% 
  don't have computers...need to consider who can't access digital 
  creds.
Kerri Lemoie:  Can we find ways to pilot with groups that don't 
  currently have access
Kerri Lemoie:  Standards still in development...good we are 
  workingnn together to move forward.
Kerri Lemoie:  Privacy by design
Kerri Lemoie:  More adoption in higher ed than in K12 (some 
  transcript uses in high schools)... Question is what value this 
  brings beyond the status quo
Victoria Feng:  How long will it take for usage to take off?
Kerri Lemoie:  Open Badges has been in existence over a decade 
  and is still underutilized... pilots for a couple more years, 
  then not sure
Kerri Lemoie: Directory of efforts: 
  <a href="https://usedgov.github.io/blockchain/directory">https://usedgov.github.io/blockchain/directory</a>
J. Philipp Schmidt:  Asking about tension between centralized 
  platform business models vs. decentralized models and 
  self-sovereign
J. Philipp Schmidt: Thank you!
Kerri Lemoie:  Business models not yet fully considered for 
  decentralized...pilots often in private networks
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What problems do solutions solve... 
  interesting that many pilots are in private networks... What was 
  your read on nuance behind "why" using blockchain?
Loïc Jeannin: I'd like to ask a question, what is the process ? 
  :)
Kerri Lemoie:  I think many are looking at centralized models, 
  considering characteristics of blockchain that are useful (e.g. 
  verification), but not enough use cases ....then can consider how
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Recommendation from report: focus on 
  ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Other main use case is to encourage use of 
  standards
Kerri Lemoie:  Greenlight is  a private network that is working 
  well because it improves processes for students, e.g to apply for 
  college
Kerri Lemoie:  In Open Badges we said "It's not about the badge" 
  , about how it is used
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Q about Dalas Comm. College and Greenlight
Kerri Lemoie:  Joe May (sp?) started with seeing challenges for 
  students to apply for multiple colleges
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Interesting to see use case around student 
  needs

  ...

Topic: US Dept of Education Blockchain in Education Report

Kerri Lemoie:  Project part of phase 1 of Ed Blockchain project
Kerri Lemoie:  What is going in in the ecosystem to inform a 
  challenge, to be launched soon
Kerri Lemoie:  40 Entities/experts interviews, lit review, online 
  research
Kerri Lemoie:  Findings - 70 active initiatives, many in pilot 
  stages, many academic and digital credentials, blockcerts
Joshua Marks: I was supposed to scribe today, but got waylaid. 
  WHo is scribing?
Kerri Lemoie:  Newer efforts using hyper-ledger, portfolios, CVs, 
  prof. evaluations, identity protection, etc.
Kerri Lemoie:  This is a top priority - many understand this is 
  important, and 2nd big theme was life-long-learning
Kerri Lemoie:  3Rd theme - connecting ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Many credentials not being used, need more success 
  in leveraging power of connected ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Underuse of digital credentials...lot of issuing, 
  not use
Kerri Lemoie:  Questions remain - what does it mean to control?
Kerri Lemoie:  Digital divide - 29% dont't have smart phones, 46% 
  don't have computers...need to consider who can't access digital 
  creds.
Kerri Lemoie:  Can we find ways to pilot with groups that don't 
  currently have access
Kerri Lemoie:  Standards still in development...good we are 
  workingnn together to move forward.
Kerri Lemoie:  Privacy by design
Kerri Lemoie:  More adoption in higher ed than in K12 (some 
  transcript uses in high schools)... Question is what value this 
  brings beyond the status quo
Victoria Feng:  How long will it take for usage to take off?
Kerri Lemoie:  Open Badges has been in existence over a decade 
  and is still underutilized... pilots for a couple more years, 
  then not sure
Kerri Lemoie: Directory of efforts: 
  <a href="https://usedgov.github.io/blockchain/directory">https://usedgov.github.io/blockchain/directory</a>
J. Philipp Schmidt:  Asking about tension between centralized 
  platform business models vs. decentralized models and 
  self-sovereign
J. Philipp Schmidt: Thank you!
Kerri Lemoie:  Business models not yet fully considered for 
  decentralized...pilots often in private networks
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What problems do solutions solve... 
  interesting that many pilots are in private networks... What was 
  your read on nuance behind "why" using blockchain?
Loïc Jeannin: I'd like to ask a question, what is the process ? 
  :)
Kerri Lemoie:  I think many are looking at centralized models, 
  considering characteristics of blockchain that are useful (e.g. 
  verification), but not enough use cases ....then can consider how
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Recommendation from report: focus on 
  ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Other main use case is to encourage use of 
  standards
Kerri Lemoie:  Greenlight is  a private network that is working 
  well because it improves processes for students, e.g to apply for 
  college
Kerri Lemoie:  In Open Badges we said "It's not about the badge" 
  , about how it is used
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Q about Dalas Comm. College and Greenlight
Kerri Lemoie:  Joe May (sp?) started with seeing challenges for 
  students to apply for multiple colleges
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Interesting to see use case around student 
  needs

 Getting involved, contributing, and following along will be easier than&nbsp;ever <p>The DIF has an active core of startups and dedicated teams at larger corporations known for their swift co-development within the foundation. Over time, this has led to rapid deployment of several useful specifications, reference implementations, and cross-competitor conversations that have solidified a vision of the broadly-interoperable decentralized identity stack. A healthy and diverse market is coming into focus today, due in large part to these&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>Limiting participation to dues-paying members proved more of a barrier to entry than expected, however, and it is clear that the paywall to participation limits inclusiveness and community-wide discussion. As both of these are critical components for building a solid and lasting foundation for truly decentralized identity solutions, DIF will be shifting to a more open modus operandi.</p><blockquote>Effective 18 June 2020, DIF has opened up participation to all technical working groups for companies under 1000 employees.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZbZuNj1j414">Ahnaf Tahsin&nbsp;Rafi</a><p>Going forward, attendance and substantial participation in all DIF-governed working group meetings, including IPR-protected ones, will be free to join as “contributors” for small- and medium-sized interested parties, with these defined as companies with under 1000 employees. Individual/freelance contributors without relevant IPR obligations to their clients will continue to be eligible to participate for free under appropriate legal agreements. Working Groups co-hosted with other organizations will continue to benefit from community-wide free participation regardless of organization type and&nbsp;size.</p><blockquote>More information on how to join&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/join">here</a>.</blockquote><p>Small- and medium-sized enterprises are encouraged to join as DIF full members, which have their logos listed on the site and are highlighted in DIF’s external communications. Other benefits to full membership include programming access to forthcoming special interest groups to guide the formation of industry-focused markets and other non-IPR-protected initiatives within the organization. More information on those initiatives is forthcoming.</p> The Genealogy of the Grand&nbsp;Opening <p>DIF was founded over 3 years ago to create a neutral space for co-developing and co-designing the key elements and protocols of a decentralized interoperable identity stack made up of interchangeable parts. Over the years, the member companies and individual contributors to the foundation have helped to raise the profile of decentralized identity on a global scale. Its contribution-first philosophy, pre-competitive cooperation ethos, and professionalism around IPR protection and recordkeeping have allowed it to make many substantial, useful, and agile contributions to various commercial and non-commercial stacks.</p><p>The shift really began at IIW28, when Oliver Terbu and Rouven Heck convened a session which produced a useful <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-self-sovereign-identity-stack-8a2cc95f2d45">overview</a> of the decentralized identity stack as a more grokkable whole, seemingly visible on the horizon by the end of 2019. A few months later, Daniel Buchner, then Executive Director, co-wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/rhythm-and-melody-how-hubs-and-agents-rock-together-ac2dd6bf8cf4">article</a> with Sam Curren addressing the false dichotomy between Microsoft’s Identity Hub design principles and the agent-focused architecture of the Aries community. Were there other mirages making practical interoperability seem further away than it really&nbsp;was?</p><p>Then, at the second DIF semi-annual meeting of 2019, traditionally an update meeting where for different workstreams to compare notes and coordinate, executive director Rouven Heck gave a keynote presentation before the updates. He invited DIF’s membership to reflect on how DIF related to adjacent decentralized-identity communities and development organizations. Were we siloing research and risking double-work? How could we bring about greater convergence of the stack, by harmonizing with and optimizing for the work already underway elsewhere?</p><p>DIF might not have changed much in the previous six months, but the landscape was changing. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has finalized the core VC specification and was ramping up to finalize the core DID specification in the coming half-year; what came next? The Hyperledger Foundation’s focus, having restructured and set an ambitious roadmap for interoperability after pushing forward the next iteration of the Indy blockchain at the core of many SSI systems, was getting a lot of attention outside the decentralized identity community with its promises of production-grade systems. If DIF continued on its code-driven, “build it first” trajectory, could we end up competing with, more than complementing, these adjacent projects?</p><p>With his quick slideshow presentation, Rouven started socializing and recruiting support for a vision of DIF that did as much coordination as co-development. A key feature of this strategy was identifying cross-community development work that would benefit from IPR protection and DIF infrastructure and inviting communities to come together in the repositories.</p><p>The first of these joint efforts was the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-starts-didcomm-working-group-9c114d9308dc">DIDComm</a> working group, identifying ways to accelerate the interoperability of wallet-to-wallet communications beyond the Indy stack, a working group that is still doing important and influential work to this day, including sending the first draft proposal to the IETF from a DIF WG. More recently, the Secure Data Storage working group has followed the same co-hosting approach, bringing a work item from the W3C community and an under-socialized contribution open-sourced by Microsoft Research together as the two model implementation inputs to what could well prove to be a widely-usable decentralized standard across all compliant stacks and most web-based contemporary topologies.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/4hcpIbqQM8c">Robert&nbsp;Bye</a> Conclusion <p>In 2020, the co-development of the widely-interoperable decentralized identity stack is turning a corner, and now more than ever it feels like we are in a crucial moment for structured and transparent cooperation to pre-empt any enclosure of the Commons. With the widest possible cooperation, we can build unity and grow the market before dividing it up into fiefdoms and brands. DIF is aiming to return to its roots and pitching a bigger tent than ever to make sure we get this right, together.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates about new working groups and new ways to get involved.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>At its WWDC, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10670/">detailed</a> that its upcoming release of Safari in iOS and MacOS 14 will enable users to use Touch ID and Face ID for web logins, and we couldn’t be happier. It marks a giant step forward in the industry’s quest to move beyond passwords in favor of cryptographically secure authentication based on FIDO standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The functionality, based on the WebAuthn API in the FIDO2 standard, will make logging in to a website as easy as it is to unlock your iPhone or iPad using whichever biometric option is available. Apple’s built-in support in its stock web browser means that every modern device platform now has built-in FIDO support, which furthers our aim of making FIDO Authentication as ubiquitous as other critical internet protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To that end, we’ve recently provided a resource that shows the latest progress for FIDO support across browsers and platforms.&nbsp; This image (shown below) is permanently hosted on our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthn resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s been really cool to watch this diagram grow both wider&nbsp; (adding in the Apple operating systems) and greener over the past 12 months or so since Apple ramped up its FIDO support. This rapid maturation and support for WebAuthn is accelerating adoption; with over 85 percent of today’s browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, many service providers are now actively working to deploy FIDO to their customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance was founded on a singular mission: To eliminate dependence on passwords by creating and driving adoption of open standards for simpler, stronger user authentication. Today, we’re closer to reaching that audacious goal that the FIDO ecosystem has been working on for the past several years. Thanks, Apple!</p>

<p>Banks in Europe have deployed customer authentication solutions for several years. These solutions have served their purpose well and enabled customers to safely log in to their bank accounts. In the world of e-commerce, these solutions, when used, have been successful in combating online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and its associated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) dramatically change the payment landscape, considering:</p>



  The mandate for strong, multi-factor authentication,&nbsp;  The emergence of Third Party Providers (TPP) accessing accounts via open APIs  



<p>The success of PSD2 will ultimately be determined by how well banks can balance user convenience with security obligations, while maximizing reach. As such, they may want to evaluate how well their legacy authentication solutions meet this new need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication standards have been proposed as a way for banks to meet all requirements in a PSD2 world — but is the change from a legacy method to FIDO worthwhile?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to learn more about FIDO Authentication standards and how they compare with legacy authentication methods used to access an account or secure an online payment. The methods compared are SMS OTPs, hardware OTP generators, CAP readers, and proprietary smartphone and biometrics-based solutions in terms of PSD2 compliance, security, usability and scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us to find out: Why change to FIDO?</p>

<p>While the Hyperledger community was gathered in Phoenix at Hyperledger Global Forum, many members took the time to sit down, on camera, and explain what happens in the array of Hyperledger working groups, special interest groups (SIGs) and technology projects. These videos are great introductions to the community-driven activities in the Hyperledger ecosystem. Geared towards anyone looking to take on a more active role in the effort to advance open source enterprise blockchain, the “How To Get Involved” video series provides an overview of the goals, key initiatives and target use cases each for each group or project. The message in each case is that you are invited to join and all are welcome here.</p>



<p>In this final post, we are spotlighting four special interest groups that are hard at work applying blockchain to core infrastructure challenges. Learn more about how to help drive industry adoption in capital markets, public sector, supply chain and telecom with these videos:</p>

<p>We set up Women in Identity just over a year ago with a mission ‘to inspire, elevate and support a more diverse workforce in the digital identity industry’. We understand the vital importance of representation within our sector. And we are committed to ensuring that the voices of all&nbsp; under-represented groups – whether through their gender, race, age, sexual-orientation, socio-economic status – can be heard.</p>
<p>We’ve made progress. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far. But, it isn’t enough.</p>
<p>We don’t pretend to have all the answers; but we do understand the problems.&nbsp; And we want to work together with our industry to find the answers. It’s not about diversity as a general issue. It is about identifying and addressing solutions that fundamentally don’t work for large elements of our planet’s population. When we get it wrong, we deny people access to services that – in some cases – are enshrined in Human Rights and Equality laws.</p>
 To tackle this we need your help. 
<p>You will no doubt have issued a statement in support of Black Lives Matter following the murder of George Floyd. You will also, most likely, have celebrated PRIDE month in your organisation. But what comes next? Words are not enough.</p>
 
 We need allies. 
 Allies who have powerful connections and networks that can help us achieve change. 
 Allies who will walk the walk with us …. 
 
<p>Systemic inequality is deeply ingrained throughout our society and our sector is not immune. More than other areas of technology, we have a moral responsibility to ensure that identity systems intended FOR all are built BY all.</p>
<p>That’s why we have decided to create a D&amp;I Code of Conduct &amp; Implementation Framework specifically for the identity industry. This will offer organisations a toolkit to adopt a more diverse and inclusive approach, particularly in the development of identity products.</p>
 Will you work with us? We need your allyship: 
 
 Spread the word among your colleagues and wider network 
 Share our updates on LinkedIn and Twitter (#womeninID; #womeninidentity; #ForAllByAll #DiversitybyDesign) 
 Join our network:<a href="http://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member"> www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member</a> 
 Pledge your support by contributing to our research fund via<a href="https://womeninidentity.org/donations/"> https://womeninidentity.org/donations/</a> 
 
<p></p>
<p>Let’s use this moment in time to transform our industry into something that is fair, just, and representative of ALL the people that will ultimately have to use our products.</p>
<p>We thank you for your support,</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we wrote a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/04/21/trustid-a-new-approach-to-fabric-user-identity-management">post</a> for the Hyperledger blog about how we were working in <a href="https://blockchain.telefonica.com/">Telefónica</a> to face the challenges of managing identities in a new and actually decentralized way. Based on the interest raised by this work, we proposed TrustID as a new project under the umbrella of Hyperledger Labs. <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/TrustID">TrustID</a> was accepted and has moved to Hyperledger Labs so, from now on, the open source community will contribute to the evolution of the solution initially developed by Telefónica. The aim is to develop a new standard to simplify identity management in blockchain networks regardless of the underlying technology of the networks.</p>



<p>Over the past few years, we have witnessed the development and creation of digital identity solutions based on blockchain technology. However, most of these solutions are in silos, not interoperable, and dependent on the underlying technology.</p>



<p>The same credentials used to access your owned Bitcoins and manage your tokens in Ethereum should let you update the state of a Hyperledger Fabric asset. This is the rationale behind TrustID. In the end, the goal that we have set for TrustID is to create a cross-platform mechanism to manage one unique identity to have access to any blockchain. It doesn’t matter if the network you are operating on is based on Hyperledger technologies (Fabric, Besu, Indy, etc.) or other common blockchain technologies.</p>



<p>In Hyperledger Fabric, identities are centralized by the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that have issued those identities. Initially, TrustID implements identity management in Hyperledger Fabric as a decentralized alternative to CAs by using the DID standard specified by the W3C. However, we expect to make it compatible with more Hyperledger platforms like Besu or Indy and even other blockchain technologies other than Hyperledger ones.</p>



<p>Going into a deeper level, TrustID is made up of two components: (1) a library (SDK) that implements the management of a single identity and (2) a chaincode to implement this logic in the blockchain in a decentralized way. That single identity will be interoperable with other identities on different blockchain platforms wallets.</p>



<p>At Telefónica, we started TrustID as a module to make it easier to enable identity management for our product <a href="https://trustos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">TrustOS</a>. Beyond our product need, TrustID solved a common issue for many blockchain projects. We realized it could be more than a module and instead be a standalone project itself. As we shared this vision with other members in the community, we confirmed the interest in the TrustID approach for managing identities, so we decided the best way to make it really awesome was to open source it. Hyperledger Labs became the best option.&nbsp;In the roadmap, we are envisioning a compatibility of TrustID with the proposal of the Sidetree protocol and Verified Credentials from the DIF (<a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>), and its integration with other projects of the ecosystem such as Hyperledger Cactus, Indy and Besu.</p>



<p>We expect TrustID to grow thanks to its inclusion as an Hyperledger Lab. Last but not least, we’d appreciate any feedback and contributions from the Hyperledger community. We hope and&nbsp; believe that TrustID is the starting point to allowing a level of interoperability between blockchain platforms for identity management. And remember, TrustID is looking for your contribution…We want you!</p>



<p>Check out the TrustID lab <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/TrustID">here</a> to see the code and start contributing.</p>

I wanted to endorse this video as well. Very interesting. One application in the VC space (perhaps there are others, but this one occurs to me) might be to monitor which fields are selectively disclosed to a specific verifier (in one or multiple proving interactions), and apply the mathematics to know how close the holder is getting to being strongly identified. I was familiar with this idea already, but unaware that there were formally proven mathematics to measure it. Cool stuff!

A new global framework for regulating the crypto industry is coming into place this year. One of the most important new rules that businesses interacting with crypto has to implement is what is known as the Travel Rule. The Travel Rule, which is also known as The Wire Transfer rule, requires a business managing crypto on behalf of their user to transfer KYC’d (Know-Your-Customer) Identity Information to a receiving institution. Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of Notabene, will share his insights and explain how his company is tackling this business challenge for the industry.

Complying with this rule provides many challenges for the industry. Several industry groups have already started to invent several new protocols to solve this. Notabene helps financial companies be compliant with new, global anti-money laundering (AML) regulations for crypto transactions coming into effect right now. Pelle believes this is a critical use case for SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity). In this talk, he will go over the rule itself, industry protocols, how he sees SSI can help here, and how they are helping to solve it.

In Saturn JSF is not only a security solution, it is also used for counter-signatures to simplify state-holding in payment systems.  That is, a two-phase payment works as follows:
Merchant - Bank

1. Signed request for a RESERVATION -&gt;  Create and store a unique identifier in a reservation-record
2. &lt;- Return signed authorization embedding the request as well as the unique identifier.
3. Signed request for a TRANSACTION embedding the previous message -&gt; Bank verifies that it was the signer in #2, find the record associated with the unique identifier and that's about it.

<a href="https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/saturn/hybrid-payment.html#6">https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/saturn/hybrid-payment.html#6</a>

By securely embedding related messages in each other (aka "Russian doll"), there is no need for external references to previous messages.

Enjoy!

<p></p>
<p>On Thursday 25 June, we officially launched Women in Identity in New Zealand and Australia, hosted and facilitated by Andrew Weaver, Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ. We chose to focus on Digital Equality in Aotearoa (Maori name for New Zealand) and our panel of amazing women brought a wealth of experience and knowledge to the table:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kim Connolly-Stone, Policy Director at Internet NZ;</p>
<p>Pamela Moss, Director of Planning at the University of Auckland;</p>
<p>Janelle Riki-Waaka, Relationships Manager and Kaihuawaere at CORE Education;</p>
<p>Elena Higgison, Principal Advisor on the Digital Identity Transition Programme at the Department of Internal Affairs and</p>
<p>Kaye-Maree Dunn, Engagement Specialist and Founder of Āhau</p>
 What is creating the digital divide? 
<p>We see a lot of digital transformation but rarely does it focus on diversity and inclusion. The panel looked at issues that are widening the digital divide in our country:</p>
 
 Reliable and affordable internet connectivity is essential in New Zealand to narrow the digital divide 
 Access to digital devices and resources is essential if our tamariki (“children and young people”) are to have equitable opportunities to learning 
 A big chunk of those underserved in our communities are indigenous people and our education system has not been designed for them 
 The need to differentiate between diversity (who is in the room) and equity (who is trying to get in the room) 
 The gap between our younger generation’s learning vs their parents’, especially among indigenous people, is creating a digital divide that can lead to a breakdown in bonding 
 A need to focus on broadening our workforce to bring in more indigenous people 
 How to diversify the tech industry by addressing the mathematics literacy gap, starting with schools 
 Learn from community leaders that are addressing digital inclusion and participation 
 
 Education is key … 
<p>We focused much of our discussions on education and home learning (specifically online learning). The gaps that exist today may have a huge impact on the future of our communities.&nbsp; These were my main takeaways from the session:</p>
<p>Janelle highlighted that the education system was not actually designed to be inclusive of, and accessible to, indigenous people, it was designed from a Western perspective and the content and the way we deliver it becomes a barrier. Add in a requirement for access to technology and financial means and we start to pile inequality on top of inequality. The divide between the “haves” and “have nots” is going to have to change at a fundamental level.&nbsp; We cannot afford to allow the next generation to enter the workforce already disadvantaged. Many of those already affected are indigenous people. Inclusion needs to start with&nbsp; them – not see them as an exception. We cannot choose one ’identity’ or one world view on which to build our society.</p>
<p>Pamela noted we could do more to diversify our workforces by improving the levels of mathematics literacy throughout the education system.&nbsp; Many digital products and solutions would benefit from greater diversity in thinking. This can only come from a more diverse workforce. We need to change the pedagogy of teaching and learning. If we want a wider range of people to engage in the tech sector, we need to figure out how to teach them better!</p>
 …. but we also need more, affordable, technology 
<p>On availability of devices, we agreed that the government in New Zealand had moved quickly to get devices out to kids who needed them for home-learning.&nbsp; However, there were discrepancies between top-performing schools and those in lower socio-economic parts of our communities. Janelle has worked to support the Ministry of Education in getting devices out the door; the government ordered the kit for connectivity to support the new ways of learning but these arrived too late. Often the schools had already gone back and, in a large number of cases, users struggled to access platforms and materials due to weak internet connectivity.</p>
<p>On affordability, Pamela shared how this is a further barrier for many students. Some families simply do not have space for home-learning. Many have economic priorities higher than the, often prohibitive, costs of an internet connection. Even at University and College level, students struggled to access the platforms needed for online learning. There is a huge divide between the well-off and the non well-off.</p>
<p>On internet accessibility, Kim highlighted how Internet NZ were pushing for ‘internet for all and internet for good’ whilst trying to address affordability and connectivity issues in Aotearoa. The government needs to invest into this space. Having access to reliable internet should be as common as access to a reliable power connection. As a country we are not there yet.</p>
<p>Elena shared&nbsp;that we need to take an “inside out approach”. We need to reimagine a future state where those that are impacted most by exclusion can work alongside community leaders to design solutions that reflect the needs of all.</p>
 
 Policy and decision makers need to visibly ‘walk the talk’. 
 Encourage our entrepreneurs to do amazing things within the public sector 
 Work closely with the movers and shakers to diversify our workforces 
 Amplify the work and leadership of those already driving change in our communities to drive for greater digital inclusion” 
 
<p>This Meet-Up was a session that sparked immense curiosity among those of us not exposed to the education sector, The conversation wasn’t about ‘how can we get more women into tech/identity’. Nor was it about ‘what is the best digital identity technology out there today’.</p>
<p>It was, at its core, about our communities and how we serve them better. As one attendee commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This has been an enlightening discussion for me on the wide-ranging considerations around identity.&nbsp; It has made me question my approach to “Digital Identity” which started quite narrowly on the basis of what individuals need to get verified online in a national system, often in order to access basic systems like government services, banking, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Identity is about real people in all their diverse communities and we must ensure that every aspect of their ‘identity’ is considered – not just the elements attributed to them by their government.</p>
<p>A sincere and personal thank you to everyone who participated in this event.</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When we discussed this at the Solid summit, I hosted a session on a 'contractors wallet' trying to understand the basic semantics a 'pod' could hold so I could make a prototype against that. There must be multiple drafts of this from each party, is this something we can share as a group and work from or towards unifying? 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm joining this group to ensure that the credentials we are offering in our products will not just stay relevant but push the standard forward. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some questions... How much of the conversation will be highly technical? What is the balance of commercial/government/independent attendees? Is there some sort of survey we can offer at the end of the call to establish the breakdown of the group and intentions and motivations of the majority?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; That's the motivation and the intention (you got it).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We want to be able to move wallet content, and we want to know which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; parts of that content are usable before and after the content has been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; moved.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The challenge is that we can't say __how__ a feature is implemented, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; we still want to know __if__ it is supported.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Our first stab at a solution to this problem, was to describe the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; interfaces as a set of abstract functions which operate on the data
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; model, and yield data model objects and side effects.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We think that's sufficient, and we have tests to show that it works for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ethereum transfers and credential issuance... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We're working towards testability regarding multiple credential formats,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; for example JWT, LD Proofs and ZKPs... We think if we can show that we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; have modeled functionality support in a way that works for these, that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; an indication that the general approach works.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We also think it's helpful to have a list of wallet features, which have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; descriptions which exist in one place... and which explain how those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; features related to other standards... but just to be clear, we don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; see describing how those features are implemented as in scope.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just a thought -- being able to list supported features in a Web app
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manifest for Web-based wallets could be quite useful, especially to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; users that are "just in time" installing a wallet via a CHAPI interaction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, agreed. This highlights that there are at least two questions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; related to wallet portability:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of data?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; functionality?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe what you're saying is that EDVs will enable us to answer #1
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; above with a definite "yes".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The Universal Wallet 2020 work will enable us to answer #2 above with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; definite yes/not for every standardized wallet feature.

         TLDR: The chairs have decided to archive the CCG-hosted DID Method Registry at https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-registry because it has been moved to https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/. Without a sustained objection, we will proceed to archive the GitHub repository two Tuesdays from now after the scheduled weekly CCG meeting, on July 7th.

         <a>TLDR: The chairs have decided to archive the CCG-hosted DID Method Registry at </a><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-registry">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-registry</a> because it has been moved to <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/">https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/</a>. Without a sustained objection, we will proceed to archive the GitHub repository two Tuesdays from now after the scheduled weekly CCG meeting, on July 7th.

Background:
The DID Method Registry was started at the CCG and contains a list of DID methods known to the community, added by community members. The DID Working Group has now taken on this work, and you can now find the DID method list here:
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods</a>

This archival action was initiated by this CCG issue:
<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-registry/issues/82">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-registry/issues/82</a>

There is now an issue in the DID WG to ensure the repository history is migrated as well:
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/issues/72">https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/issues/72</a>

Considerations:
- There now exist further defined contribution guidelines: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries#ci-tests">https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries#ci-tests</a>
- There are now additional interoperability criteria for DID methods: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries</a>

If you have any feedback, please reply to the list with a summary of your issue. Indicate if it is an OBJECTION, which if sustained would halt this action and potentially begin Special Topic Call(s) on this action, or a CONCERN, which would not affect this action but only serve inform the community about important considerations related to this action.

Best,

Topic: GC Talent Cloud

Matt Lisle is scribing.
Val/David: discoverability of talent and skill recognition... 
  focused on federal public service
Val/David: current HR is too focused on formal creds... data is 
  disconnected... no way to show real-time KSAs
Valerie Thomas:  Worker signals of KSA that is credible and 
  trusted... Canada rise of gig economy - gov't spending billions 
  to recruit/hire talent, can be improved... "more than my job 
  title"
Valerie Thomas:  Talent Cloud a grassroots effort... pilot live 
  in 10/18. talent repository for project-based work
Valerie Thomas:  Talent Cloud is public sector "gig 
  marketplace"... skills/credential recognition engine for 
  employment
Valerie Thomas:  TC - first openbadges pilot for Canada gov't... 
  also blockcerts pilot. Involved with T3 network.
Valerie Thomas:  Differentiators - takes too long to onboard 
  staff... get good talent in faster... more data for better 
  matching between manager/worker... diversity/inclusion (more 
  later)... promoting remote work by default... skills/competneices 
  credential recognition
Valerie Thomas:  Skills profile for workers... tools for 
  recruiting/hiring for managers and HR... onset of COVID: 
  repurpose tools to find matches for critical roles/skills... 
  developing indigenous talent portal - indigenous people create 
  profile, identify skills, by and for indigenous people
Joshua Marks: Q
Valerie Thomas:  TC Skills Architecture... comes out of much 
  research on future of skills studies... TC included in their 
  skills database... being part of open skill ecosystem, want to 
  connect to bigger space
Valerie Thomas:  Current state... data from those who go through 
  hiring process, but not hired, are lost. not tracking skills data 
  through interviews, assessments, etc. missed opportunity.
Valerie Thomas:  Process map for verifiable skill assessment 
  records... person creates profile, claim skills (work, personal, 
  education, etc), application is assessed, once candidate passes 
  assessment it triggers record and goes into profile... added to 
  profile/wallet and reused for other applications/jobs
Valerie Thomas:  Working with private sector, not-for-profit, 
  academia, public sector... end of high level overview of TC. now 
  overview of UX/UI work
Valerie Thomas:  Walkthrough of process between applicant 
  claiming skill, hiring manager verifying skill, adding that skill 
  to applicant record
Valerie Thomas:  Demo... worker claims a skill (design research). 
  opportunity to tap into open taxonomies/ontologies to speak same 
  language as others. worker claims level of skill, evidence, etc.
Valerie Thomas:  Manager sees claim from worker... invited worker 
  to assessment... takes notes during assessment (e.g. written 
  exam)... creates assessment record
Valerie Thomas:  Back to candidate... has captured all data from 
  process in their profile and can reuse in the future.
Valerie Thomas:  Demo of verifiable credentials skills prototype 
  from David...
David I. Lehn:  User profile page... merge web app with world of 
  decentralized data and wallet. using open libraries... user 
  chooses "create skill"
David I. Lehn:  Skill on worker profile... mangaer now has 
  "verify" button... click it, skill becomes VC...
David I. Lehn:  User presents credential from wallet... (hope to 
  support multiple wallets)... select credential... credential 
  handler api to store credential to wallet
David I. Lehn:  Going forward... interest in relevant UX 
  studies... merging centralized and decentralized worlds... they 
  want to remain open source, but able to integrate... looking for 
  most suitable and highest quality libraries and staying connected 
  with community
Simone Ravaoli: Congrats, Val and David awesome work !
Joshua Marks:  Skill architecture question... interested in 
  transferable skills... where are they formatted and how can we 
  crosswalk/integrate? implmenting CASE or other standards?
Valerie Thomas:  Trying reach out into different communities... 
  met with CAS (?)... looking to structure data to become 
  interoperable... to date, been ad-hoc... but hoping to connect 
  with bigger broader systems.
David Mason: CAS is CASS <a href="https://cassproject.org/">https://cassproject.org/</a>
David I. Lehn:  Correction CASS... CASS is a specification not a 
  standard. recommendation from joshua_marks to focus on 
  interoperable/crosswalk efforts
Joshua Marks:  How picking assessment, particularly for

Joshua Marks: <a href="http://opensalt.org/">http://opensalt.org/</a>
Valerie Thomas:  No perfect answer, they have a process where 
  applicant applies for Canada gov't job... hiring manager has to 
  have assessment process with rubric... TC creates tool to capture 
  that data
Valerie Thomas:  No standardized assessments for every skill... 
  hiring manager already building tools/rubrics, goal is to create 
  a library of tools... also to help with documentation of 
  assessment/hiring (data gets missed). collect data so it becomes 
  part of record. another manager can trust it. won't solve 
  ambiguity of assessment, but can reflect light on process that 
  already exists.
Joshua Marks:  Suggestion... less about assessment, more about 
  work task evaluations. Val: part of idea of dynamic record of 
  worker/assessments
Nate Otto:  Ability accept VC from other systems/wallets... what 
  is claims structure that you're accepting? what would external 
  person who wants to recognize a skill, how would they get 
  credential processed?
Nate Otto:  Asked if they'd seen the prototypes from VC for Edu 
  for things like skill recognition?

David I. Lehn:  Not yet... looking for partners/info...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  David mentioned using many of same protocols 
  that we're using in CCG... David's wallet screenshots use 
  credential handler api, available through CCG.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Good place to collaborate... exchanging 
  protocols, data model of credentials, etc.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Interested in further alignment work around 
  taxonomies. would like to hear more about Joshua's work in 
  Broward. on technical side, collaborating on protocols.

Group page: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/gnap/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/gnap/</a>

Charter: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-gnap/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-gnap/</a>

This group is chartered to develop a fine-grained delegation protocol for
authorization and API access, as well as requesting and providing user
identifiers and claims. This protocol will allow an authorizing party to
delegate access to client software through an authorization server. It will
expand upon the uses cases currently supported by OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
(itself an extension of OAuth 2.0) to support authorizations scoped as
narrowly as a single transaction, provide a clear framework for interaction
among all parties involved in the protocol flow, and remove unnecessary
dependence on a browser or user-agent for coordinating interactions.

The delegation process will be acted upon by multiple parties in the protocol,
each performing a specific role. The protocol will decouple the interaction
channels, such as the end user’s browser, from the delegation channel, which
happens directly between the client and the authorization server (in contrast
with OAuth 2.0, which is initiated by the client redirecting the user’s
browser). The protocol will include a means of specifying how the user can
potentially be involved in an interactive fashion during the delegation
process. The client and Authorization Server (AS) will use these interaction
mechanisms to involve the user, as necessary, to make authorization decisions.
This decoupling avoids many of the security concerns and technical challenges
of OAuth 2.0 and provides a non-invasive path for supporting future types of
clients and interaction channels.

The group will define interoperability for this protocol between different
parties, including
 - client and authorization server;
 - client and resource server; and
 - authorization server and resource server.

The group will seek to minimize assumptions about the form of client
applications, allowing for:
- Fine-grained specification of access
- Approval of AS attestation to identifiers and other identity claims
- Approval of access to multiple resources and APIs in a single interaction
- Support for multiple access tokens in a single request and response
- Support for directed, audience-restricted access tokens
- Separation between the party authorizing access and the party operating the
client requesting access

The group will define extension points for this protocol to allow for
flexibility in areas including:

- Cryptographic agility for keys, message signatures, and proof of possession
- User interaction mechanisms including web and non-web methods
- Mechanisms for conveying user, software, organization, and other
information used in authorization decisions
- Mechanisms for presenting tokens to resource servers and binding resource
requests to tokens and associated cryptographic keys
- Optimized inclusion of additional information (including identifiers and
identity assertions) through the delegation process

Additionally, the group will provide mechanisms for management of the protocol
lifecycle including:

- Discovery of the authorization server
- Revocation of active tokens
- Mechanisms for the AS and RS to communicate the access granted by an access
token

Although the artifacts for this work are not intended or expected to be
backwards-compatible with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, the group will attempt
to simplify migrating from OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to the new protocol
where possible.

This group is not chartered to develop extensions to OAuth 2.0, and as such
will focus on new technological solutions not necessarily compatible with
OAuth 2.0. Functionality that builds directly on OAuth 2.0 will be directed
to the OAuth Working Group, including functionality back-ported from the
protocol developed here to OAuth 2.0.

The group is chartered to develop mechanisms for applying cryptographic
methods, such as JOSE and COSE, to the delegation process. This group is not
chartered to develop new cryptographic methods.

The group is chartered to develop mechanisms for conveying identity
information within the protocol including existing identifiers (such as email
addresses, phone numbers, usernames, and subject identifiers) and assertions
(such as OpenID Connect ID Tokens, SAML Assertions, and Verifiable
Credentials). The group is not chartered to develop new formats for
identifiers or assertions, nor is the group chartered to develop schemas for
user information, profiles, or other identity attributes, unless a viable
existing format is not available.

The initial work will focus on using HTTPS for communication between the
client and the authorization server, taking advantage of optimization
features of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 where possible, and will strive to enable
simple mapping to other protocols such as COAP when doing so does not
conflict with the primary focus.

Milestones to include:
- Core delegation protocol
- Key presentation mechanism bindings to the core protocol including TLS,
detached HTTP signature, and embedded HTTP signatures
- Conveyance mechanisms for identifiers and assertions
- Guidelines for use of protocol extension points
- (if needed) Guidelines on migration paths, implementation, and operations

Where possible, the group will seek to make use of tools to guide and inform
the standardization process including formal analysis, architecture documents,
and use case documents. These artifacts will not be considered as working
group milestones or deliverables.

The working group will cooperate and coordinate with other IETF WGs such as
OAUTH, and work with external organizations, such as the OpenID Foundation,
as appropriate.

Milestones:

  Jul 2021 - Core delegation protocol in WGLC

  Oct 2021 - Key presentation mechanism binding to the core protocol, TLS, to
  WGLC

  Oct 2021 - Key presentation mechanism binding to the core protocol, 
  detached HTTP signatures, to WGLC

  Oct 2021 - Key presentation mechanism binding to the core protocol,
  embedded HTTP signature, to WGLC

  Dec 2021 - Guidelines for use of protocol extension points to WGLC

  Feb 2022 - Guidelines on migration paths, implementation, and operations to
   WGLC

The arc of her career moved to even smaller organizations, culminating with start-ups and eventually entrepreneurship. Over her career, she honed her product management skills, developing particular love for industry standards development work and software usability.<br><br>Lisa currently works in a private foundation (Wrethinking, the Foundation) where her activities focus on usable technology and industry standards that put the user in control of their digital life. In October 2018, Lisa pitched the long-germinating idea of a consumer-facing certification mark to let people know if technology is treating them with dignity. Thus, the Me2B Alliance emerged from a nine-year hibernation, and was born. Mirroring the problem scope of traditional product management, the Me2B Alliance glues multiple disciplines and existing initiatives together to help consumers make better technology choices, increasing the number of good choices through consumer demand and awareness.<br><br><a href="https://meetinglab.zoho.com/meeting/register?sessionId=1082607744">Register Today!</a>*<br><br>*Please note: you will be prompted to enter a minimal amount of information when registering for the webinar.

&gt;
&gt; I wonder if we can/should use this plugin in CCG broadly (i.e. other

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I do not know for a fact, but I do not believe it is easy to do. It is a

&gt; also more codified) than the CG’s.

&gt; It is a home-grown tool, meaning that it is open source:

&gt; WHAT IS IT?
&gt;
&gt; This is basically the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) process which
&gt; covers Verified Credentials (VC) spec maintenance for VCWG (Verified
&gt; Credentials Working Group). The VCWG finished the 1.0 spec and is now only
&gt; responsible for maintenance. Any new changes to the VC spec should come
&gt; through the CCG as a PR (pull-request), which will then be sent to the
&gt; VCWG. Then the PR will be reviewed by the VCWG for IPR requirements and if
&gt; passes be added as a maintenance change.

&gt; Thank you to Manu and Dan B. for this draft.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have provided some replies to the comments in that document.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; One more practical note that is worth noting (for those who have not yet
&gt; participated similar activities). If anyone makes a PR to the repository
&gt; (ie, a proposed change on the Model specification) then an add-on to github
&gt; will automatically do an IPR check.  If the submitter is an official member
&gt; of the VC Working Group, then the system will recognize this and the
&gt; submission will be accepted as part of the IPR disclosure mechanism in
&gt; place for the Working Group participants. Otherwise, the PR will be
&gt; temporarily blocked and the submitter will be asked to make some IPR
&gt; declaration (the modalities will depend on whether he/she represents a W3C
&gt; Member organization or not).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The check can be shortcut (essentially switched off) by the WG’s staff
&gt; contact (ie, yours truly) if the PR is non-substantial, meaning that it
&gt; does not affect any normative statement (which is something the document
&gt; editors should tell me, it is not my decision).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; To avoid complications, two good practice steps:
&gt;
&gt;  • The submitter should have his/her W3C account “bound” to the github
&gt; account (go to [1], and look for ‘connected accounts’ on the left column).
&gt; It is a good idea for everyone to just make that connection once and for
&gt; all (and forget about it:-)
&gt;
&gt;  • The best is if substantial PR-s are submitted by genuine WG members...

         This is useful Ivan, thanks. I am going to add this as a note to the
document so we don't forget.

I wonder if we can/should use this plugin in CCG broadly (i.e. other
repos), but instead of checking VCWG membership, we check CCG membership.

&gt;
&gt; WHAT IS IT?
&gt;
&gt; This is basically the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) process which
&gt; covers Verified Credentials (VC) spec maintenance for VCWG (Verified
&gt; Credentials Working Group). The VCWG finished the 1.0 spec and is now only
&gt; responsible for maintenance. Any new changes to the VC spec should come
&gt; through the CCG as a PR (pull-request), which will then be sent to the
&gt; VCWG. Then the PR will be reviewed by the VCWG for IPR requirements and if
&gt; passes be added as a maintenance change.

&gt;
&gt; Thank you to Manu and Dan B. for this draft.

&gt;
&gt; - Link to the document:
&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpmxkY0mefzZf47GXNM0qC83lBEhyaRSBmf4NJpaa6M/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpmxkY0mefzZf47GXNM0qC83lBEhyaRSBmf4NJpaa6M/edit</a>
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have provided some replies to the comments in that document.
&gt;
&gt; One more practical note that is worth noting (for those who have not yet
&gt; participated similar activities). If anyone makes a PR to the repository
&gt; (ie, a proposed change on the Model specification) then an add-on to github
&gt; will automatically do an IPR check.  If the submitter is an official member
&gt; of the VC Working Group, then the system will recognize this and the
&gt; submission will be accepted as part of the IPR disclosure mechanism in
&gt; place for the Working Group participants. Otherwise, the PR will be
&gt; temporarily blocked and the submitter will be asked to make some IPR
&gt; declaration (the modalities will depend on whether he/she represents a W3C
&gt; Member organization or not).
&gt;
&gt; The check can be shortcut (essentially switched off) by the WG’s staff
&gt; contact (ie, yours truly) if the PR is non-substantial, meaning that it
&gt; does not affect any normative statement (which is something the document
&gt; editors should tell me, it is not my decision).
&gt;
&gt; To avoid complications, two good practice steps:
&gt;
&gt;    - The submitter should have his/her W3C account “bound” to the github
&gt;    account (go to [1], and look for ‘connected accounts’ on the left column).
&gt;    It is a good idea for everyone to just make that connection once and for
&gt;    all (and forget about it:-)
&gt;    - The best is if substantial PR-s are submitted by genuine WG
&gt;    members...

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Medium technical abilities here* 
&gt;&gt;&gt; When we discussed this at the Solid summit, I hosted a session on a 'contractors wallet' trying to understand the basic semantics a 'pod' could hold so I could make a prototype against that. There must be multiple drafts of this from each party, is this something we can share as a group and work from or towards unifying? 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm joining this group to ensure that the credentials we are offering in our products will not just stay relevant but push the standard forward. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some questions... How much of the conversation will be highly technical? What is the balance of commercial/government/independent attendees? Is there some sort of survey we can offer at the end of the call to establish the breakdown of the group and intentions and motivations of the majority?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; That's the motivation and the intention (you got it).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We want to be able to move wallet content, and we want to know which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; parts of that content are usable before and after the content has been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; moved.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The challenge is that we can't say __how__ a feature is implemented, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; we still want to know __if__ it is supported.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Our first stab at a solution to this problem, was to describe the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; interfaces as a set of abstract functions which operate on the data
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; model, and yield data model objects and side effects.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We think that's sufficient, and we have tests to show that it works for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ethereum transfers and credential issuance... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We're working towards testability regarding multiple credential formats,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; for example JWT, LD Proofs and ZKPs... We think if we can show that we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; have modeled functionality support in a way that works for these, that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; an indication that the general approach works.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We also think it's helpful to have a list of wallet features, which have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; descriptions which exist in one place... and which explain how those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; features related to other standards... but just to be clear, we don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; see describing how those features are implemented as in scope.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just a thought -- being able to list supported features in a Web app
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manifest for Web-based wallets could be quite useful, especially to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; users that are "just in time" installing a wallet via a CHAPI interaction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, agreed. This highlights that there are at least two questions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; related to wallet portability:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of data?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

         Hi all,
Sorry for the confusion. The chairs have just now learned there is a DID WG
F2F that runs into our time and we expect to have quite a few cancellations.

Therefore we are canceling this week's CCG Tuesday meeting.

Thanks,
Kim

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Just a thought -- being able to list supported features in a Web app

&gt; &gt; We're working towards testability regarding multiple credential formats,
&gt; &gt; for example JWT, LD Proofs and ZKPs... We think if we can show that we
&gt; &gt; have modeled functionality support in a way that works for these, that's
&gt; &gt; an indication that the general approach works.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We also think it's helpful to have a list of wallet features, which have
&gt; &gt; descriptions which exist in one place... and which explain how those
&gt; &gt; features related to other standards... but just to be clear, we don't
&gt; &gt; see describing how those features are implemented as in scope.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought -- being able to list supported features in a Web app
&gt; manifest for Web-based wallets could be quite useful, especially to
&gt; users that are "just in time" installing a wallet via a CHAPI interaction.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;     Yes, agreed. This highlights that there are at least two questions
&gt; &gt;     related to wallet portability:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     1. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of data?
&gt; &gt;     2. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of
&gt; &gt;        functionality?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I believe what you're saying is that EDVs will enable us to answer #1
&gt; &gt;     above with a definite "yes".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     The Universal Wallet 2020 work will enable us to answer #2 above
&gt; with a
&gt; &gt;     definite yes/not for every standardized wallet feature.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Did I understanding you correctly?

Heather Vescent:  Welcome to the call - standard IP note - 
  standard queueing notes.

Topic: Introductions / Reintroductions

Heather Vescent:  Anyone want to introduce themselves / 
  reintroduce yourself?
Lucy Yang:  I'm currently involved in COVID-19 credentials 
  initiative... here to learn.
Heather Vescent:  Sam, Dan?
Sam Smith:  Hi Sam Matthews Chase, founder of Venn Agency - 
  actively building in VC space for last couple of years, very 
  involved in community early on, Kim brought me in, worked w/ Kim 
  a lot on Loci (our product) - credential system to replace fire 
  evacuation maps and safety training, to ensure anyone going into 
  a building has a basic copy of map and prove that they've seen 
  it.
Sam Smith:  Creates credential w/ BC government and orgbook guys 
  - keep people safe - about to go to market in Vancouver, excited 
  to be back with everyone again.
Heather Vescent:  Sounds great, maybe when you're ready, you can 
  give us a presentation of what we've been working on.
Dan Pape:  Hi Heather, congrats on the new Chair position, 
  working on an off with Digital Contract Design, BTCR DID Methods, 
  get that going.
Dan Pape:  Haven't been here lately, conflict with another call, 
  but wanted to join this one to hear new Chair soapbox.
Heather Vescent:  Maybe you can give us an update of BTCR later.

Topic: Announcements and Reminders

Sam Smith: Thnks for this link @by_caballero

Heather Vescent:  Not hearing anyone, moving on. Happening now, 
  Anil John's Industry day - beginning of the call - happening now 
  - interested in call details, applications, on what he just sent.
Heather Vescent:  Mention recurring CCG meetings - in addition to 
  additional call today - VCEDU monday 8am PT - led by Kim.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Verifiable Credentials for Education Task 
  Force - run by me (MIT) and James (McMaster Univeristy) - that's 
  where digital credentials consortium talks about 
  standards/prototypes for educational use cases, but joined by 
  other communities including well known groups in EDU space - IMS 
  GLobal, PESC, IEEE groups.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We're working on surveys, what's out there, 
  relevant standards, different geographic areas. Now we're 
  identifying different use cases, credentials in pilots, how can 
  you link to competency use cases.
Heather Vescent: ANNOUNCEMENTS: 
  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/</a>
Dan Burnett: Voip, who's making noise?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Folks from the publishing group have pointed 
  out overlap - in general, deciding to talk about how these 
  systems will get used in real world, every monday - 8am PT, 11am 
  ET.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Will send the link to our page.
Heather Vescent:  DID Resolution calls... Mondays at 1pm... 
  Markus Sabadello is running those.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: VC-EDU: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/</a>
Heather Vescent:  Secure Data Storage WG calls - Dmitri is one of 
  the Chairs in that group.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Secure Data Storage - joint W3C CCG and DIF 
  group - working on specification that is related to alot of 
  credential identity work, once we have identities, keys, VCs... 
  how can we store them securely - multilayer storage stack can be 
  used to build higher level data servers like Solid like Identity 
  Hubs and similar projects... we meet weekly, free to join if you 
  sign IPR agreement, encourge folks interested in that stuff to 
  drop by.
Heather Vescent:  There is an OpenID Connect SIOP happening this 
  Thursday, tickets are sold out - is anyone here planning to 
  attend? Can you do a report out next week?
Wayne Vaughn:  I will be attending and I will take the lead to 
  give brief update next week.
Heather Vescent:  Anything else that we didn't cover?
Heather Vescent: Q

Topic: Action Items

Heather Vescent:  A little update - when getting up to speed on 
  Co-Chair, there are a lot of action items.
Heather Vescent:  One of the challenges we have is completing 
  items...
Heather Vescent:  It might make sense to go back to participants 
  to check in and see where things are... lot has changed in 
  context of need for these things, capabilities for technology, as 
  we have new leadership, it makes sense to go through and see what 
  status is on these things.
Heather Vescent:  Let's have an honest look at where we are - 
  true possibility of completing these - if you've been working on 
  one of these items, I'll send an email asking questions about it 
  - just an opprotunity to tell me what state is and either 
  recommit or get it off of your plate. Will be contacting you in a 
  week.
Heather Vescent:  Wayne, kim, anything else regarding that?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I have one thing, Action item -- process 
  summary for VCWG - resolved over email - wanted to make sure.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/94">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/94</a>
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Sounds like Dan has written something up, 
  Dan will ping group with that.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Some combination of Dan and Manu will follow 
  up.
Heather Vescent: Link to document: 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpmxkY0mefzZf47GXNM0qC83lBEhyaRSBmf4NJpaa6M/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpmxkY0mefzZf47GXNM0qC83lBEhyaRSBmf4NJpaa6M/edit</a>
Dan Burnett:  The link is in issue, please take a look - Manu and 
  I worked it up - manu came up with most of it, outline there, it 
  should be turned into something fuller. We think it might be good 
  to start with this process.
Dan Burnett:  We can figure out where to send this next.
Dan Burnett:  The context  for this -- the Verifiable Credentials 
  Maintenance WG is active now, that WG exists solely to provide 
  IPR and scope charter checks, but not do any work... the 
  expectation is that W3C CCG  will do work and make proposals as 
  pull requests and send to VCWG for review. That gorup will then 
  gather long enough to review document pull request, see if it 
  meets IPR requirements, if yes, goes forward as a maintenance 
  change.
Wayne Vaughn: Oops
Heather Vescent:  What's the next step?
Dan Burnett:  People should comment.
Heather Vescent:  What is the timeline? Is there a deadline?
Dan Burnett:  There are people that have said they want to make 
  some modifications. Orie wants to make some changes, for example. 
  Feel free to set deadline if you wish, otherwise, when folks want 
  to do something.
Heather Vescent:  SHould we set two weeks for deadline for 
  comments?
Dan Burnett:  Sure, that's fine.
Dan Burnett:  I don't wnat to create work for group, if people 
  don't want to change document, ...
Heather Vescent:  Yes, but don't want it to fall off... welcome 
  to heather's project management... get ready to get pinned to 
  deadlines. :)
Heather Vescent:  I'll follow up with email to list, please make 
  comments within two weeks, give it another week, have this be a 
  topic for CCG... In three weeks from today, we'll discuss this, 
  anyone make comments can make comments at that point, then dialog 
  during this call, then week after that, we'll lock this down. In 
  four weeks, this'll be knocked off of our todo list.
Heather Vescent:  Juan, you're up.

Topic: DIF Virtual Face to Face Update

Heather Vescent: Q
Juan Caballero:  I'm reading from my notes, soon to be a Medium 
  post.
Juan Caballero:  Just wanted to provide structure and major news 
  items... all videos going on  youtube. There will be a Medium 
  post and links as well as links people can share in chat.
Juan Caballero:  There were a good number of people there - about 
  101 people were observed in one of the sessions -- interop 
  session -- update session -- somewhere near the middle.
Juan Caballero:  After kick off logistics, first after 
  introduction - code of conduct - IIW29 made an expanded code of 
  conduct, voted on as we speak, within steering committee of DIF - 
  more structure, more friendly to first timers, etc.
Juan Caballero:  That is going live soon - then there was interop 
  WG - had previously been interop project.
Juan Caballero:  The refactoring/restructuring into WG is to have 
  non-IPR protected WG that does not build anything, does not write 
  specs, simply exists for coordination for DIF and adjacent groups 
  - identify roadblocks to interop, best possible non-redundant 
  home for roadblocks.
Juan Caballero:  The new vision for interop group won't work w/o 
  steady reliable attendance that are connected to adjacent 
  communities.
Juan Caballero:  That is being hashed out, first meeting was open 
  to public, Friday 9am PT, 12pm ET, 6pm CET.
Juan Caballero: <a href="https://bit.ly/DIF-interop-kickoff">https://bit.ly/DIF-interop-kickoff</a>
Juan Caballero:  If anyone is interested in joining that, that is 
  a long free-form session, Anil spoke a bit about how interop 
  relates to Aries interop, SVIP interop, W3C interop processes, 
  the goal of interop is to be as open as possible and as 
  productive as possible.
Juan Caballero:  Anyone that has been coming to CCG, folks are 
  welcome from here, but if CCG doesn't show up, we're shutting it 
  down! no pressure :)
Juan Caballero:  Test suites, who hosts and maintains, big fan of 
  modular things so that might be a big part of conversation friday 
  - do come to that.
Juan Caballero:  Three 1 hour sessions that were a cluster of WGs 
  and work items.
Juan Caballero:  What's going on in those groups report out, lot 
  of comments on people sort of new to DIF, new to a lot of these 
  groups, things they're working on that may or may not be 
  congruous.
Juan Caballero:  First of these was DID Layer and Protocol Layer 
  groups, ID and Discovery group, sidetree WG - ion things, 
  highlights there, if you haven't been -- ID and Discovery group, 
  obviously connected to Markus' group at CCG, two sides of same 
  kind, Universal Resolver -- little more production ready/grade.
Juan Caballero:  Philip from Danube, making instances that are 
  CI/CD - audit releases, integrate everything up to date, mark 
  which drivers aren't updated, autodeprecate things falling out of 
  compliance, exciting project, that's progressing.
Juan Caballero:  Also talked about 3 things that are open sourced 
  - key recovery schemes, Microsoft research -- from sam smith - 
  john callahan, open sourcing biometric key recovery scheme.
Juan Caballero:  These three things are going to be documented as 
  complementary solutions, modular combinable solutions.
Juan Caballero:  Did:peer going to be open sourced in coming 
  months as well.
Juan Caballero:  Something you can follow on Github...
Heather Vescent: Q
Adrian Gropper:  We also have our Trust Over IP and reconstituted 
  Sovrin Foundation come on the scene... not a question for Juan, 
  but rather a comment or placeholder for our group here - I am 
  getting confused by these parallel efforts and sort of feel like 
  we need to address this - partition work around 
  itnerop/governance - does someone have something more useful than 
  what I just said?
Heather Vescent:  I'm hearing concern around multiple work 
  efforts and division of labor.
Adrian Gropper:  I'm seeing an exploding number of parallel 
  efforts.
Heather Vescent:  There are some efforts to try and bring 
  conversations between different groups to reduce these types of 
  activities - the desire is always to minimize overlap. Reality is 
  that no matter how much we want there to be one place to go, it 
  just never seems to happen in tech space. But don't want to jump 
  ahead to the soapbox, trying to facililate/streamline efforts. Is 
  this a conversatin we should have in CCG?
Heather Vescent: Q
Sam Smith:  I think best way to discuss is write an article... 
  isn't really a here problem.
Juan Caballero:  As far as interop group - I would make sure to 
  show up in DIF group... maybe not a here problem.
Sam Smith: +1 Manu
Manu Sporny:  YYY
Heather Vescent:  Yes, these things happen elsewhere and we need 
  to engage, not ideal, but it happens and we need to engage.
Heather Vescent:  Any other comments around DIF F2F?
Juan Caballero: Correct: I would make sure to show up to THIS 
  group (CCG)

Topic: New Chair Soapbox

Heather Vescent:  We wanted to set stage for things we're 
  thinking about doing in course of new leadership with this group. 
  Kim, Wayne, one of you want to go first?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I can go first, tried to convince Chairs not 
  to have me do this, but it was a good idea. :)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Looking forwrad to next year - just to 
  reiterate some things I've said in the past - I've been in EDU 
  space for a while. it's been interesting trying to merge 
  educational credentials and use cases with emerging Decentralized 
  Standards.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What makes it better/worse is the prior art 
  - ther eis a lot of work already done in defining schemas, but 
  not based around decentrlaized trust, direct transfer between 
  orgs, getting these to work in a decentrlaized framework to 
  promote learner/recipient control is challenging. We have made 
  progress.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Some efforts in T3 Innovatio nNetwork and 
  W3C CCG VCEDU - got VCs being used as interop wrapper, so that's 
  good... but still have to make progress on value proposition, 
  identity related standards, and also little focus on exchange 
  protocols. Lot of work on data models, less on exchange 
  protocols.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Those are one of the intersting areas, other 
  thing that comes up - first vertical where we find ourselves 
  hitting real world use cases - to some extent, we don't know how 
  to do basic things with VCs, like legal signature requirements, 
  we know they can work but there is work is required.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I'm itnerested in bringing in work items 
  that are affected by those use cases, allow the standards we 
  build here used in educational use cases and beyond, in some 
  cases, we need to tweak/extend standards, others require just 
  more education/discussion - interested in championing that over 
  the next year.
Sam Smith: I love listening to you talk about credentials kim &lt;3
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We are running into issues before others 
  are, so use of standards in real use cases are very important ... 
  second of three areas that are of interest.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  All of Chairs care about opening up 
  participation, reflecting on situation we have now - non-tech 
  folks feel like they can't contribute. In rush to get technical 
  spec going, hitting checkmarks, we really do go heads-down on 
  specs and fail to take use cases to next level, from broader 
  basis, how do we start using these in real systems? Legal 
  perspective, ethical, hold ourselves more accountable. With this 
  set of chairs, strong focus on broadening
Participation.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  That's one way, other way is more confrete 
  around process overhead - how do we make sure people can 
  contribute work items while keeping IPR concerns straight, but 
  not saying "do everythin gin Github right away".
Juan Caballero: +1
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I think we can do better... way tthat could 
  manifest, types of deliverable work items that CCG releases, 
  Community Notes/Reports can serve as powerful statements. Would 
  like us to contribute in that way, no need to write technical 
  specs.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Third is as we've alluded to - working with 
  other communities, streamline how we work with other communities 
  - minimize friction - endless rehashing of work that happens 
  elsewhere.
Heather Vescent:  Thanks Kim, very inspiring to hear what we're 
  going to be doing.
Wayne Vaughn:  Ultimately, I'd like to see diverse and productive 
  work items make it through - want diverse perspectives, when I 
  say "diversity" - but dimensions across tech/industry but also 
  society. Like how do we interop with IETF, GNAP (TxAuth) -- 
  figuring out next iteration after OAuth2 - have Credentials 
  there... look at OpenID Connect.
Wayne Vaughn:  Interested in technical interop - Linux Foundation 
  - Hyperledger, Trust over IP, how can we foster collaboration w/ 
  Oasis and DIF?
Wayne Vaughn:  Permissioning frameworks... another kind of 
  interop is with industry and government - VCEDU - supply chain, 
  national identity systems, governments that are interested.
Wayne Vaughn:  Any guidelines? Bad idea? We need to have 
  discussion to get to those issues.
Wayne Vaughn:  Society - large implications to our work, 
  preliminary discussions with EFF, ID2020 - UNICEF and UN 
  concerns, how can we reflect those perspectives into our 
  technical work. I hope members here can choose what they want to 
  hear about.
Juan Caballero: NZ!
Wayne Vaughn:  Global initiative, CCG meeting accessible in APAC 
  - 3 DID groups in South Korea, Japan, Singapore... Australia... 
  Mattr is based there, get their involvement.
Wayne Vaughn:  Also, hosting another meeting... doing an IP 
  janitor and better communication infrastructure ... shout out to 
  Manu that's been working on that ... hopefully we'll see 
  something soon on that.
Heather Vescent: Q
Wayne Vaughn:  Looking forward to helping on that.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Heather, should we start next meeting with 
  your soapbox?
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I want to make sure you have time
Heather Vescent: No need. I just need 1 min
Juan Caballero:  Got through most of groups - didn't mention DID 
  Auth demos and glossary group - cochair w/ glossary group - 
  looking for people to help w/ next round of glossary.
Heather Vescent:  I'm interested in many of the things that kim 
  and wayne said -- wanted to take a few minutes... one item very 
  important to me - that's about strategic planning and project 
  management, I want to enable us a community to work better, more 
  streamlined, and more messy... can put things in place that make 
  it easy for us to do messy hard difficult work.
Heather Vescent:  This is like a tomato cage, balance between 
  order and chaos, too much order and you get rigidity and lack of 
  creativity, you don't want to go too far in the other direction.
Heather Vescent:  If you grow a tomato without a tomato cage, you 
  get a plant on the ground, bugs spoiled fruit. However, if you 
  get a tomato cage in place, you support the plan so it can 
  produce the most.
Heather Vescent:  I'm going to be doing some work on strategic 
  planning in this community - don't need to have a background, I 
  will lead, would love a colead -- also, will go through our 
  historical work processes so they support the work we're getting 
  done and support the way we work and change.
Heather Vescent:  There are great processes that have been put in 
  place by past chairs, at same time, things can get over 
  complex... we'll go ahead and wrap up for now, more planning in 
  the future.
Heather Vescent:  If anyone has any questions, or if you want to 
  present, please reach out.

&gt; 
&gt; The challenge is that we can't say __how__ a feature is implemented, but
&gt; we still want to know __if__ it is supported.
&gt; 
&gt; Our first stab at a solution to this problem, was to describe the
&gt; interfaces as a set of abstract functions which operate on the data
&gt; model, and yield&nbsp;data model objects and side effects.
&gt; 
&gt; We think that's&nbsp;sufficient, and we have tests to show that it works&nbsp;for
&gt; ethereum transfers and credential issuance...&nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; We're working towards testability regarding multiple&nbsp;credential formats,
&gt; for example JWT, LD Proofs and ZKPs... We think if we can show that we
&gt; have modeled functionality support in a way that works for these, that's
&gt; an indication that the general approach works.
&gt; 
&gt; We also think it's helpful to have a list of wallet features, which have
&gt; descriptions&nbsp;which exist in one place... and which explain how those
&gt; features related to other standards... but just to be clear, we don't
&gt; see describing how those features are implemented as in scope.

Just a thought -- being able to list supported features in a Web app
manifest for Web-based wallets could be quite useful, especially to
users that are "just in time" installing a wallet via a CHAPI interaction.

&gt; 
&gt;     Yes, agreed. This highlights that there are at least two questions
&gt;     related to wallet portability:
&gt; 
&gt;     1. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of data?
&gt;     2. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of

&gt;     I believe what you're saying is that EDVs will enable us to answer #1

&gt; 
&gt;     The Universal Wallet 2020 work will enable us to answer #2 above with a

We believe that, when used responsibly, VCs can be great privacy-preserving components of solutions addressing the numerous social and economic challenges caused by this and future pandemics. We are aware that without a holistic perspective from the onset, many COVID-19 technology solutions may introduce unintended results (e.g. surveillance, abuse of personal data, social inequalities). To avoid such outcomes, we have committed ourselves to open collaboration with a diverse range of experts, embracing open standards, and protecting the fundamental privacy and personal data rights of all stakeholders.</p><p>If you lead a project implementing VCs in your local communities and are aligned with our values, we want to hear from you. We also wish to share and discuss our work openly, including its technical, medical, legal, ethical, and business implications. We invite your input on these considerations as well as any other important aspects that can help build responsible, human-centric VC solutions to fight COVID-19.</p><p>If you are ready to contribute or collaborate, please join us at <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">https://www.covidcreds.com/</a>.</p>

The challenge is that we can't say __how__ a feature is implemented, but we
still want to know __if__ it is supported.

Our first stab at a solution to this problem, was to describe the
interfaces as a set of abstract functions which operate on the data model,
and yield data model objects and side effects.

We think that's sufficient, and we have tests to show that it works for
ethereum transfers and credential issuance...

We're working towards testability regarding multiple credential formats,
for example JWT, LD Proofs and ZKPs... We think if we can show that we have
modeled functionality support in a way that works for these, that's an
indication that the general approach works.

We also think it's helpful to have a list of wallet features, which have
descriptions which exist in one place... and which explain how those
features related to other standards... but just to be clear, we don't see
describing how those features are implemented as in scope.

&gt; Yes, agreed. This highlights that there are at least two questions
&gt; related to wallet portability:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of data?
&gt; 2. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of
&gt;    functionality?
&gt;
&gt; I believe what you're saying is that EDVs will enable us to answer #1
&gt; above with a definite "yes".
&gt;
&gt; The Universal Wallet 2020 work will enable us to answer #2 above with a
&gt; definite yes/not for every standardized wallet feature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm writing this list to propose a new W3C CCG Work Item
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "universal-wallet-2020":
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Repo: <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spec: <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/">https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/</a>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The proposed specification will define a data model and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abstract interfaces for digital wallets that store currency, credentials,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; key material or references to key material, meta data, and cards... The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goal being to help unify DIDs, VCs,  and cryptocurrency wallet data models,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by defining missing vocabulary or defining relationships between existing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vocabulary, reusing existing specifications as much as possible without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modification.... Including DIDs, DID Key, VCs, VC HTTP APIs, WebKMS, VP
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Request Spec, Presentation Exchange, etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We're not proposing anyone change any of their existing wallets. We're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proposing a specification describing a way for them to import and export
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wallet contents according to a data model, and to disclose support for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set of abstract interfaces, as a way of enabling users to tell what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; features a given wallet supports (currency, identity, and/or credentials).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We cannot move, what we don't understand, or that has no common
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portability format.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We've presented this work to the CCG, DIF and Aries WG, and gotten
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; positive feedback, but also some concern about scope / informative vs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; normative statements for interfaces. We're also tracking compatibility with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Indy Wallets and Secure Data Stores... and we're working to understand how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to represent data structures like connections or indy credential schemas in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ways that support portability and interoperability.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We'd like to continue this discussion and modify the spec in the W3C
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CCG with participation from the community.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We'd like to move the current reference implementation to the DIF at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same time, but we're open to keeping them co-located if thats desired,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we want to be sensitive to companies that cannot (or don't desire to)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; commit to the reference implementation but wish to develop the spec.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Happy to answer any questions!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We're looking for additional organizations to co-edit / sponsor the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development of the specification in the W3C CCG.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting work, thanks for sharing!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm glad you are separating data from meta data, and looking at caching
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at example 3:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; didDocument seems to be undefined in the context document
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The sense I am getting from the example is that the did is both the
&gt;&gt;&gt; subject and the object, both the cached document and the DID subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; the did: appears in two places in the example, is that allowed?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; would it not mean that all the fields that apply to the cached document
&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to the did subject, and maybe also the did document?

 Reflections from an androgynous, ‘out’ gay woman in the world of technology 
Shelley Bryen
<p>Pride month often makes me reflect on how far the LGBTQ+ community has come, but also on how far we still have to go. I have read so many moving often heartbreaking “coming out” stories and have often wondered if I should write my own. Then it occurred to me that I have never read anything about what it is like to be an ‘out’ lesbian in the corporate landscape. In fact, it is only recently that I have met and connected with other gay, bisexual and transgendered women in technology – one of the many benefits of being a part of Women in Identity, I guess!!</p>
<p>Let me start by saying I refer to myself as a “gay woman”. For some reason, the term “Lesbian” just sounds too clinical to me – like a condition for which one may possibly need shots . The term “gay” somehow sounds far more fun and life affirming. Really though, it is a personal thing – all about which one fits with your heart and your head. It’s a core part of one’s own identity. For me, gay fits.</p>
<p>I officially came out at the age of 29, a few years after the birth of my son. Although I always knew I was “different”, no one could ever accuse me of not giving heterosexuality a good ole’ college try! Therefore, it was vital to me to spend the rest of my life “being me” without apology – and that has meant professionally as well as personally.</p>
<p>My formal training was in Fine Art, but my meandering career path eventually led me to technology. For more than 25 years I’ve had various roles from Strategic Alliances and Product Management, to Research and Strategic Marketing. Today, my focus is on Remote Identity, Document Verification and Digital Identity.</p>

<p>I am very thankful to be a Canadian, always have been. Canada has been one of the leaders in human rights and citizen protections through concrete legislation. It is certainly worth celebrating that employment laws and societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights have shifted dramatically in last quarter of a century. Even the US Supreme Court just made <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-supreme-court-lgbtq-1.5612327">a landmark ruling</a> forbidding workplace discrimination, protecting gay and transgender employees.</p>
<p>Still, even where there are laws providing protections and legal recourse, there is still a challenge in changing ingrained perceptions, stereotyping and commonplace discriminatory behaviours.</p>
 Starting a new position in a male dominated industry 
<p>Everyone has experienced the nervousness and excitement of joining a new company. Being a woman in an industry that is male dominated is one factor that causes anxiety enough! (In 2018, only <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/03/women-in-technology-statistics.html">20% of all jobs in technology were held by women</a>.) Now add in being androgynous and gay. It may be intersectionality at its best, but It brings with it nagging questions like:</p>
 
 How do I collectively “come out” in a clear but informal way? Heterosexuals never have to announce their sexuality to their new colleagues. Imagine discussing this casually with your team, your boss, your department, your whole company. You have to either intentionally choose to:
 
 Be vague – changing pronouns, being disingenuous, and not connecting on the same level with your coworkers around the “water cooler” – for your entire career 
 Be true to yourself but understand it may have negative implications 
 
 
 Will my identity affect:
 
 My work environment? 
 My access to visible projects? 
 My road to promotion? 
 
 
 How will my male colleagues treat me?
 
 Like “one of the boys”? This has pluses and minuses.<br>
Plus: You are a “quirky” equal. Which is rare for many women.<br>
Minus: They may make assumptions that you feel exactly the same way as they do – including about women. Not easy when conversations become disrespectful or shift towards sexual harassment. 
 Like a threat or competitor? 
 
 
 How will my female colleagues treat me?
 
 Candidly, I do not fit in well with the ultra view of a powerful businesswoman. I often feel like a different species. 
 What will happen if I have to share accommodation with other female colleagues? Will my status as a gay woman make the situation uncomfortable for everyone? 
 
 
 What happens if I have a problem with a co-worker, a supervisor, a client?
 
 Are there policies specific to LGBTQ+ concerns and redress? 
 
 
 
 A History of Workplace Challenges 
<p>In the late ‘90s, I chose to leave a job as the result of homophobic remarks specifically about me. I demanded an apology from the CEO and threatened legal action but, ultimately, I decided I needed to be in a more inclusive business culture if I were to thrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trustradius.com/buyer-blog/women-in-tech-report">71% of women</a> have worked in a tech company with a strong “bro culture.” The majority that have worked in male-dominated environments have felt excluded, unsafe, and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At another company, my personal property was destroyed and my workspace violated when a nameless person vandalized my office. The catalyst for this action was not difficult to determine:</p>
 
 An LGBTQ+ Film Festival poster was removed and some kind of liquid poured over it; 
 A calendar with daily LGBTQ+ historical facts had been shredded and thrown in the garbage and; 
 A calendar of Michelangelo art was on the wall, depicting “The Creation of Adam”. 
 
<p>I did what you are supposed to do: I filed a complaint with HR. (The company was suitably shocked and supportive.) But the incident was never resolved nor spoken of again.</p>
<p>No policies were ever changed.</p>
 Lots of room for optimism 
<p></p>
<p>Despite these instances of workplace homophobia, in general, my career through technology has been a successful&nbsp; – and a happy – one. I continue to make important connections and contributions. I feel I have been able to climb the corporate ladder unhindered, especially in this last decade.</p>
<p>Today, I am the Director of Marketing at <a href="https://worldreach.com/about/leadership-team/">WorldReach Software</a>, a Canadian company and leaders in remote identity and document verification. WorldReach not only has truly diversity-driven and inclusive policies, their <a href="https://worldreach.com/worldreach-and-international-womens-day-striving-for-gender-parity/">company statistics</a> prove it:</p>
 
 A woman founder 
 50% of Senior Management are female and have been with the company for more than 20 years 
 40% of all staff are women, including 67% of Technical Team Leads and 
 19 different Languages are spoken by employees 
 
<p>Now I can just be me&nbsp; – at home and at work. It is a blessing. Every now and again, I get called “Sir” or am asked to leave a women’s bathroom when I’m travelling. Given how far LGBTQ+ rights have come, I can live with that.</p>
<p>I am exceedingly grateful for the scores of gay, bisexual and transgendered women who suffered greatly and fought hard for the rights I enjoy today. They have paved the way for the promise of equality for all. I commit to doing everything I can to make it easier for the next generation of LGBTQ+ people to thrive. It is the very least I can do.</p>

this worked because there was a large organisation (SUN Microsystems)
funding the development of the RI alongside the Specification and
Conformance Test Suite (this in turn feed into professional services and
commercial licences for productised versions of the reference
implementations of the Java technologies - but in the end it did not work
out so well for SUN :( ).


I agree that applying the term "reference implementation" outside the JCP
framework (and funding) is problematic (RI is one part of three elements)
.  Also worth noting the Characteristics of a Reference Implementation in
the source cited in Wikipedia, is from a presentation where the term "*Gold
standard*" is *italicised* ; and so I would assume it was presented with
some context, now lost.


For what it's worth; for me, "*model implementation*" fits for an open
source implementation intended to "illustrate" a specification for others
to emulate, be inspired, and/or extend. This differs from an implementation
not opened up to others, usually for commercial reasons, and flags that the
implementation is intended to follow the specification, rather then exceed
it, again usually for commercial/competitive reasons.

&gt; &gt; Manu, could you please elaborate on your concerns about calling

&gt;
&gt; Thanks to Leonard, DanB, Dmitri, Kim, and DanielH's comments, which do a
&gt; much better job than I would have elaborating on why using the term
&gt; "reference implementation" is problematic.
&gt;
&gt; The biggest issue is the "gold standard" language in the Wikipedia
&gt; definition, which I don't disagree with.
&gt;
&gt; The problem that we've seen play out time and time again in the global
&gt; standards process over the last 25+ years is that "reference
&gt; implementation" for algorithms work out well. Reference implementations
&gt; for non-trivially complex systems, like what is being proposed in
&gt; Universal Wallet 2020, end up with software that is:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Not maintained since it's often unfunded work.
&gt; 2. Not suitable for production use (see #1 above), and thus is
&gt;    dangerous if developers use it as a reference.
&gt; 3. Politically unstable because of the power dynamics -
&gt;    developers think that features implemented in the
&gt;    reference implementation are blessed by the group, when
&gt;    it may be that the developer that did the reference
&gt;    implementation just through the optional feature was neat.
&gt;    To combat this, committees form around reference
&gt;    implementations and suck energy away from the spec.
&gt; 4. Always behind the state of the market, because of #1 above
&gt;    and the aforementioned need to "design by committee".
&gt;
&gt; Fundamentally, it was the failure of reference implementations that led
&gt; to conformance test suites and ensuring that the specification was the
&gt; gold standard (and not some piece of software).
&gt;
&gt; To put it another way, reference implementations for non-algorithmic
&gt; standards have been an anti-pattern for a very long time. You'll note
&gt; that many of the folks speaking against it have been around the block
&gt; several times in the standards space -- they are speaking from
&gt; experience, possibly having proposed the same thing in the past and
&gt; having it blow up in their face. I know that's what's happened to me in
&gt; every reference implementation attempt I've participated in. :)
&gt;
&gt; So, what do we call it? An implementation... because that's all it is.
&gt; If it's good, it's a conforming implementation... hopefully, one of many.
&gt;
&gt; -- manu
&gt;
&gt; PS: Also, I'll note that this was far down on our list of concerns. We
&gt; don't need to bikeshed it now. :)

<div class='wrap'>

<p>1.&nbsp;What is the mission and vision of Jumio?</p>



<p>Jumio’s mission is to make the internet a safer place by protecting the ecosystems of businesses through cutting-edge online identity verification and authentication services that quickly and accurately connect a person’s online and real-world identities. Jumio’s automated identity verification solutions fight fraud, maintain compliance and onboard new customers faster.</p>



 <a href="https://www.jumio.com/"></a> 



<p>2.&nbsp; Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>As more Canadians turn to their computers and smartphones to manage their money (and every other aspect of their lives), it’s important for organizations across a broad span of industries to provide a seamless digital experience, and that starts with the onboarding process. Consumers expect the ability to create online accounts in minutes, not days — anytime, anywhere. They aren’t afraid to take their business elsewhere if they encounter unnecessary friction. In fact more than 40 per cent of potential new accounts are sacrificed during the onboarding process because of time-consuming, clunky identity verification processes.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Jumio address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>As companies evolve to become more digital, more and more interactions with customers will occur on a screen rather than in person. These digital transformation efforts start with creating new accounts online. Digital identity verification is an unsung hero in an organization’s digital transformation strategy because companies must verify that a person’s digital identity matches their physical identity when conducting business online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, it’s imperative for Canadian enterprises to build in the necessary operational resiliency to survive this new reality. The COVID-19 pandemic has showcased the value of IT and digital transformation, and the need for organizations to accelerate the transition.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200206005047/en/Big-Banks-Raising-Customer-Satisfaction-Effective-Digital">J.D. Power study</a>, nearly one-third (31 per cent) of new account openings are executed through a bank website or mobile app, up from 22 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, the number of new account openings at branches has declined year over year by 10 per cent, and now comprises just over half of all new account openings. Sadly, many financial institutions still require users to visit a store or branch office to create a new account or to perform routine transactions — increasingly, this is going to be a difficult mandate as many of us are now homebound and social distancing.</p>



<p>This is a wake-up call for organizations that have placed too much focus on daily operational needs at the expense of investing in digital business and long-term resilience. Jumio helps Canadian businesses to digitally transform their KYC/AML and onboarding processes so they can quickly, securely and compliantly onboard new customers.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is playing a leading role in online identity verification in a somewhat surprising way. In recent years, Montreal has emerged as a major technology hub for artificial intelligence (AI) due to the prominence of AI talent and research support in the city. This has allowed a number of companies, including Jumio, to launch AI labs in Montreal. In Jumio’s case, our goal is to build production AI models that perform three vital functions related to online identity verification: data extraction, fraud detection and risk scoring. In fact, AI has already been productionalized to reduce the time it takes to verify the digital identities of remote users. At Jumio, AI models have reduced the average customer transaction time by more than 50 per cent, with more significant reductions planned in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in effect, Canada is driving the AI-based innovation that is powering faster and more accurate online identity verifications around the globe. </p>



<p>5.&nbsp; Why did Jumio join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Jumio joined the DIACC because we wanted to be part of the conversation and help shape the emerging digital identity ecosystem. Jumio is a global leader in AI-based identity verification and biometric-based authentication and we process close to 300,000 identity verifications each day. As a result of our experience, we have much to offer in terms of best practices, especially given the pioneering work of our AI Labs division based in Montreal. At the same time, we want to learn from other members about best practices and emerging frameworks for digital identification and authentication.</p>



<p>We share DIACC’s mission of enabling Canadians to completely and securely participate in the global digital economy by establishing a robust, secure, scalable, inclusive and privacy-enhancing digital ecosystem. Our industry is evolving quickly and many institutions are relying on yesterday’s technologies, including knowledge-based verification and credit bureau queries which offer low levels of identity assurance and open the door to impersonation fraud and account takeovers. We are playing a valuable role in helping Canadian enterprises, of all stripes, understand the key trade-offs they need to consider and help them adopt more modern, AI-based approaches to digital identity verification and authentication.</p>



<p>6.&nbsp; What else should we know about Jumio?</p>



<p>Jumio is the global leader in online identity verification because of our commitment to innovation and the customer experience. Jumio leverages a unique combination of technologies including AI, OCR, computer vision, machine learning and leading-edge biometrics to set the industry benchmark for identity verification accuracy, fraud deterrence and simplified KYC/AML compliance. Moreover, Jumio has spent the last five years refining and innovating around the customer experience. This includes reducing the number of steps required to verify an ID document or identity. This also includes optimizing the language and graphics used on screen to help maximize online conversions. These types of innovations are no less significant and help our business customers streamline their customer’s online journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jumio has verified more than 250 million identities issued by over 200 countries and territories from real-time web and mobile transactions. Jumio’s solutions are used by leading companies in the financial services, sharing economy, digital currency, retail, travel and online gaming sectors. Based in Palo Alto, Jumio operates globally with offices in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific and has been the recipient of numerous awards for innovation.</p>

<p>The global movement in support of “good ID” advanced another step today as ID2020 announced ZAKA as its third “certified” digital ID solution.</p><p>Most of us take the ability to prove our identity for granted. But for one in seven people globally, the lack of a widely recognized form of ID means being unable to access basic legal protections and social services and being unable to participate fully as citizens and voters. Worldwide, more than one billion people are systematically excluded from the modern economy because they lack any form of formal&nbsp;ID.</p><p>In 2019, ID2020 announced plans to launch the first certification mark for digital ID at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The<a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-launches-technical-certification-mark-e6743d3f70fd"> Certification </a>recognizes solutions that adhere to ID2020’s stringent standards for user-management, privacy-protection, portability, and interoperability and offers technology companies a roadmap for the development of ethical, inclusive digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>To be eligible for certification, applicants must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. To date, 29 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with our staff and advisory committees to complete the process. In March, ID2020 announced its first two certified solutions, Kiva Protocol and Gravity. Today, ZAKA joins this esteemed community of technology providers.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital ID technology into the headlines as countries around the world consider plans for digital health credentials and technology-assisted contact tracing. There has never been more urgency to “get the technology right”.</p><blockquote>“Digital ID can be a powerful force multiplier for global social and economic development, but it can also be used to exclude people or even persecute vulnerable populations like refugees, children, and the homeless,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As governments and businesses rush to adopt digital ID solutions, the ID2020 Certification is proving a valuable tool for those who are developing user-centric, privacy-protecting solutions to meet the needs of all&nbsp;people.”</blockquote><p>The Certification also provides a third-part seal of approval so that those implementing and using these technologies know that they were developed according to the highest ethical and technical standards and with full consideration of both the benefits and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>This market-based approach is already shifting the technical landscape and several multinational technology providers have adapted their technical approaches to comply with ID2020’s Technical Requirements.</p><p>About ZAKA</p><p>Based in the UK, ZAKA is committed to the idea that any person, with any phone, should be able to access any service, at any time. Like ID2020, ZAKA shares the perspective that, in an increasingly connected world, digital trust is an essential enabler of thriving economies.</p><p>ZAKA’s mobile app and software development kit (available in Android, iOS and USSD) helps individuals to build a set of verifiable digital credentials that are private, secure and portable, allowing them to connect with services such as mobile health, financial services, and education. And for service providers, ZAKA’s web dashboard allows them to configure their digital trust requirements and roll-out the solution to remotely verify and onboard customers. This allows services to concentrate on developing and distributing high-quality services, rather than be held back by high distribution and customer acquisition costs. ZAKA has also developed proprietary voice biometric technology which can be deployed together with, or separately from, it’s&nbsp;Apps.</p><p>In recent months, ZAKA has also extended its solution to support the response to, and recovery from, COVID-19. Their NewNorm™️ service is now being used by universities, employers, and event organizers to support a safe return to the “new&nbsp;normal”.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to receive the ID2020 Certification,” said ZAKA CEO and Co-Founder Nick Mason. “We expect a great return on our investment of time and resources in this process and look forward to using the ID2020 certification to set ZAKA apart from our competition. The rigorous evaluation of our company by ID2020 should give prospective partners confidence that our solution is meeting global standards and advancing the vital mission of bringing “good ID” to&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>ZAKA is already implementing their its technology in Turkey, Rwanda, and the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>In partnership with the United Nations Development Program and led by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ZAKA is helping refugees obtain verifiable digital ID credentials that are portable and owned by them. Refugees can use these credentials to connect with services in a dedicated marketplace for services that support their self-sufficiency. Through the app, refugees can also receive promotional information from their chosen services about beneficial opportunities.</p><p>In Rwanda, ZAKA is working in partnership with the utility regulator, Airtel, and other private and public partners to implement a solution that leverages voice biometrics for remote customer verification. This can be used by banks, telcos, and healthcare providers to serve rural customers, whether they own a smartphone or feature&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Here in the United States, ZAKA’s COVID-19 status tracking solution, NewNorm™️, is helping employees and customers be safe in the “new normal”. This is being used by two New York University departments that have returned students, staff, and faculty to on-site instruction.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>Based in San Francisco, ID2020 harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of responsibly implemented, user-managed, privacy-protected, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Through its advocacy, project funding, technical support, and now by certifying best-in-class identity solutions, ID2020 is helping build the infrastructure needed to strengthen social and economic development and ensure that all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-zaka-group-ltd-de019220362d">ID2020 Announces Certification of ZAKA Group Ltd.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Yes, agreed. This highlights that there are at least two questions
related to wallet portability:

1. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of data?
2. Can I migrate wallet providers without loss of
   functionality?

I believe what you're saying is that EDVs will enable us to answer #1
above with a definite "yes".

The Universal Wallet 2020 work will enable us to answer #2 above with a
definite yes/not for every standardized wallet feature.

Did I understanding you correctly?

         Yes the did document caching is very early. Our intention with it is to
support offline verification from cache when in internet denied

We have similar goals for credentials schemas for JSON-LD and hyperledger

Certain data model objects might not be rendered (unsupported data model)
or certain interfaces might not be supported (unsupported interface). As
long as the data moves, that's one part of the problem solved. But I think
it's also desirable to be able to alert the user that wallet content or
interfaces that worked previously may not be available in the current
vendor. To borrow from the IoT sphere, web things exposed IoT device
characteristics and capabilities under a common vocabulary, so you discover
easily if temperature or humidity sensors were available. Similarly, our
initial desire was to work towards knowing if ERC-20 tokens are supported
or not.

This is especially important when we consider wallets that support 3
credential formats and 10 currency / token types... Before you even move,
you might want to check that you can transfer funds after you move... With
encrypted data vaults... The good news is that you can always fix this by
just copying the raw contents to a wallet vendor that does support that
functionality.

I'm glad you are separating data from meta data, and looking at caching

Looking at example 3:

didDocument seems to be undefined in the context document

The sense I am getting from the example is that the did is both the subject
and the object, both the cached document and the DID subject

the did: appears in two places in the example, is that allowed?

would it not mean that all the fields that apply to the cached document
apply to the did subject, and maybe also the did document?

Thanks to Leonard, DanB, Dmitri, Kim, and DanielH's comments, which do a
much better job than I would have elaborating on why using the term
"reference implementation" is problematic.

The biggest issue is the "gold standard" language in the Wikipedia
definition, which I don't disagree with.

The problem that we've seen play out time and time again in the global
standards process over the last 25+ years is that "reference
implementation" for algorithms work out well. Reference implementations
for non-trivially complex systems, like what is being proposed in
Universal Wallet 2020, end up with software that is:

1. Not maintained since it's often unfunded work.
2. Not suitable for production use (see #1 above), and thus is
   dangerous if developers use it as a reference.
3. Politically unstable because of the power dynamics -
   developers think that features implemented in the
   reference implementation are blessed by the group, when
   it may be that the developer that did the reference
   implementation just through the optional feature was neat.
   To combat this, committees form around reference
   implementations and suck energy away from the spec.
4. Always behind the state of the market, because of #1 above
   and the aforementioned need to "design by committee".

Fundamentally, it was the failure of reference implementations that led
to conformance test suites and ensuring that the specification was the
gold standard (and not some piece of software).

To put it another way, reference implementations for non-algorithmic
standards have been an anti-pattern for a very long time. You'll note
that many of the folks speaking against it have been around the block
several times in the standards space -- they are speaking from
experience, possibly having proposed the same thing in the past and
having it blow up in their face. I know that's what's happened to me in
every reference implementation attempt I've participated in. :)

So, what do we call it? An implementation... because that's all it is.
If it's good, it's a conforming implementation... hopefully, one of many.

PS: Also, I'll note that this was far down on our list of concerns. We
don't need to bikeshed it now. :)

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm writing this list to propose a new W3C CCG Work Item 
&gt; "universal-wallet-2020":
&gt;
&gt; Repo: <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet</a>
&gt; Spec: <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/">https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/</a>
&gt;
&gt; The proposed specification will define a data model and 
&gt; abstract&nbsp;interfaces for digital wallets that store currency, 
&gt; credentials, key material or references to key material, meta data, 
&gt; and cards... The goal being to help unify DIDs, VCs,&nbsp; and 
&gt; cryptocurrency wallet data models, by defining missing vocabulary or 
&gt; defining relationships between existing vocabulary, reusing existing 
&gt; specifications as much as possible without modification.... Including 
&gt; DIDs, DID Key, VCs, VC HTTP APIs, WebKMS, VP Request Spec, 
&gt; Presentation Exchange, etc...
&gt;
&gt; We're not proposing anyone change any of their existing wallets. We're 
&gt; proposing a specification describing a way for them to import and 
&gt; export wallet contents according to a data model, and to disclose 
&gt; support for a set of abstract interfaces, as a way of enabling users 
&gt; to tell what features a given wallet supports (currency, identity, 
&gt; and/or credentials). We cannot move, what&nbsp;we don't understand, or that 
&gt; has no common portability&nbsp;format.
&gt;
&gt; We've presented this work to the CCG, DIF and Aries WG, and gotten 
&gt; positive feedback, but also some concern about scope / informative vs 
&gt; normative statements&nbsp;for interfaces. We're also tracking 
&gt; compatibility&nbsp;with Indy Wallets and Secure Data Stores... and we're 
&gt; working to understand how to represent data structures like 
&gt; connections or indy credential schemas in ways that support 
&gt; portability and interoperability.
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to continue this discussion and modify the spec in the W3C 
&gt; CCG with participation from the community.
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to move the current reference&nbsp;implementation&nbsp;to the DIF at 
&gt; the same time, but we're open to keeping them co-located if thats 
&gt; desired, we want to be sensitive to companies that cannot (or don't 
&gt; desire to) commit to the reference implementation but wish to develop 
&gt; the spec.
&gt;
&gt; Happy to answer any questions!
&gt;
&gt; We're looking for additional organizations to co-edit / sponsor the 
&gt; development of the specification in the W3C CCG.

         Hello my first message here :P

As an implementer i'm agree with Orie, I would like to see more interface
related information that can be used as a reference (to do TDD for
example). Sometimes it is difficult to understand some specs without this
interface related information. For me a "reference implementation" is the
one implementing all the interfaces.

&gt;
&gt; There was a desire to explain how aspects of the data model related to
&gt; each other and to other specs, but there has never been an intention to
&gt; define exactly how credentials are issued. You might use the VC HTTP APIs
&gt; or a series of DIDComm Messages, or a custom issuing flow... but regardless
&gt; of how you actually implement issue credential or transfer currency if you
&gt; can't describe the inputs and outputs as things that are wallet contents
&gt; that abide by a data model, you can't transfer those things between wallet
&gt; vendors and still support transfer or issue... or at least, it's not
&gt; obvious to me how you would do that... maybe there is a better way to get
&gt; wallet portability and interoperability that does not involve defining the
&gt; data model for wallet contents and a set of interfaces that a wallet vendor
&gt; might support that are linked to the data model.
&gt;
&gt; Both the did spec and the vc data model have data model and actions such
&gt; as "create, resolve, update, deactivate" and "issue, prove, verify"...
&gt; these are interfaces which methods must address, but they don't have to
&gt; support them all, for example did:key does not support update or
&gt; deactivate... and the mechanics of proving an indy credential are different
&gt; than a JWT.
&gt;
&gt; The hope with the wallet spec was that by defining a common set of
&gt; interfaces (some of which are basically just pointers to the vc data model
&gt; or did spec), similar choices could be made, and wallet vendors could
&gt; decide if they wanted to support "Transfer of Currency" but not "Issue of
&gt; Credentials"... but there would be at least one place where a set of common
&gt; wallet content and wallet interfaces was defined.
&gt;
&gt; It might be that the way the interface section is written needs to be
&gt; majorly overhauled. perhaps it's an informative note, or maybe it's just
&gt; untestable vocabulary definitions.
&gt;
&gt; There are a number of areas of the spec, including the representation of
&gt; correlation, connections, and the interfaces section which we think need a
&gt; substantial amount of work.

&gt;&gt;    - A reference impl is rarely a gold standard in practice; often it is
&gt;&gt;    slower or less scalable than other impls with better staffing. Also, even
&gt;&gt;    if it is bug-free it often introduces additional features and/or
&gt;&gt;    encumbering dependencies that are not part of the spec itself -- or it
&gt;&gt;    omits important features because they would introduce those dependencies,
&gt;&gt;    watering down the value prop.
&gt;&gt;    - A reference impl creates a second oracle. The spec is supposed to
&gt;&gt;    be the oracle for its own intentions.
&gt;&gt;    - Code has a different maintenance lifecycle (and different
&gt;&gt;    qualifications for contribution) compared to documents. A spec may be
&gt;&gt;    perfectly stable after it releases, with no need to re-release for years --
&gt;&gt;    but a reference impl might need to be updated on short notice to eliminate
&gt;&gt;    a security vuln, for example. All of the features touted for ref impls
&gt;&gt;    require that the code and the doc remain perfectly in sync. This is hard to
&gt;&gt;    achieve periodically, let alone continuously. (Yes, it can be done. But now
&gt;&gt;    spec writers are worried about CI/CD. Are we sure that the people
&gt;&gt;    maintaining both types of artifacts will remain equally committed and
&gt;&gt;    responsive and productive throughout the lifecycle of the concepts?)
&gt;&gt;    - There are major political problems with a "gold standard" impl.
&gt;&gt;    Whoever implements that one has undue influence -- or else you have
&gt;&gt;    maintenance by committee, which is *really* hard.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Despite these problems, I do see some value in this. But I think it only
&gt;&gt; manifests if the scope of the impl is very small. A great example of a
&gt;&gt; reference impl is the algorithms that the Unicode consortium published for
&gt;&gt; UTF8 encoding and detection. These were not complete implementations of all
&gt;&gt; things Unicode-related. They were not big projects that required complex
&gt;&gt; maintenance. Rather, they were short (50-ish line) snippets of C code that
&gt;&gt; made the abstract descriptions of the algorithms usefully concrete. Because
&gt;&gt; they were narrow and crisp samples, there was little risk that they
&gt;&gt; contained concept errors (the impact of the sort of unanswered questions
&gt;&gt; Christopher is talking about). The consortium only produced such code for
&gt;&gt; things where confidence was very high.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thus, a reference impl of a particular algorithm (say, resolution of
&gt;&gt; relative URIs in DID docs) might make sense to me; a reference impl of
&gt;&gt; issuance or verification of a VC is *way* too ambitious and politically
&gt;&gt; fraught to clear the same bar.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wallet).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I personally would like to see the community get together to better name
&gt;&gt;&gt; these different parts, or even better, name the connections between the
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts. Right now the three major platforms, much less small players like
&gt;&gt;&gt; BTCR, don't have any agreement on the naming conventions for the parts,
&gt;&gt;&gt; much less ready for a universal architecture.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd hoped that at either RWOT9 or RWOT10 that we'd make some progress on
&gt;&gt;&gt; this, but clearly it will likely be a while before we get have another RWOT
&gt;&gt;&gt; to word together F2F, so figuring out how to do it virtually I think would

+1 to this being closer to the working definition. Full disclosure, my
mental model of "reference implementation" was largely shaped by usage in
the java platform, which didn't have the weight of "gold standard".

Curious what precedents existing in w3c for what we're trying to do here.

&gt;    - A reference impl is rarely a gold standard in practice; often it is
&gt;    slower or less scalable than other impls with better staffing. Also, even
&gt;    if it is bug-free it often introduces additional features and/or

&gt;    watering down the value prop.
&gt;    - A reference impl creates a second oracle. The spec is supposed to be
&gt;    the oracle for its own intentions.
&gt;    - Code has a different maintenance lifecycle (and different
&gt;    qualifications for contribution) compared to documents. A spec may be
&gt;    perfectly stable after it releases, with no need to re-release for years --
&gt;    but a reference impl might need to be updated on short notice to eliminate
&gt;    a security vuln, for example. All of the features touted for ref impls
&gt;    require that the code and the doc remain perfectly in sync. This is hard to
&gt;    achieve periodically, let alone continuously. (Yes, it can be done. But now
&gt;    spec writers are worried about CI/CD. Are we sure that the people
&gt;    maintaining both types of artifacts will remain equally committed and
&gt;    responsive and productive throughout the lifecycle of the concepts?)
&gt;    - There are major political problems with a "gold standard" impl.
&gt;    Whoever implements that one has undue influence -- or else you have
&gt;    maintenance by committee, which is *really* hard.
&gt;
&gt; Despite these problems, I do see some value in this. But I think it only
&gt; manifests if the scope of the impl is very small. A great example of a
&gt; reference impl is the algorithms that the Unicode consortium published for
&gt; UTF8 encoding and detection. These were not complete implementations of all
&gt; things Unicode-related. They were not big projects that required complex
&gt; maintenance. Rather, they were short (50-ish line) snippets of C code that
&gt; made the abstract descriptions of the algorithms usefully concrete. Because
&gt; they were narrow and crisp samples, there was little risk that they
&gt; contained concept errors (the impact of the sort of unanswered questions
&gt; Christopher is talking about). The consortium only produced such code for
&gt; things where confidence was very high.
&gt;
&gt; Thus, a reference impl of a particular algorithm (say, resolution of
&gt; relative URIs in DID docs) might make sense to me; a reference impl of
&gt; issuance or verification of a VC is *way* too ambitious and politically
&gt; fraught to clear the same bar.

&gt; Everytime this comes up, I wonder why members of this community seem
&gt; opposed to the wikipedia definition:

&gt;
&gt; Characteristics of a Reference Implementation:
&gt;
&gt; 1.   Developed concurrently with the specification and test suite;
&gt;
&gt; 2.   Verifies that specification is implementable;
&gt;
&gt; 3.   Enables the test suite to be tested;
&gt;
&gt; 4.   Serves as a Gold Standard against which other implementations can be
&gt; measured;
&gt;
&gt; 5.   Helps to clarify the intent of the specification in situations where conformance
&gt; tests

&gt; inadequate
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does W3C specifically discourage the use of the term "reference
&gt; implementation".... I assumed this was a common practice:
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/webofthings/webofthings.js">https://github.com/webofthings/webofthings.js</a>

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regardless of the name, these are the characteristics I'm looking for. As
&gt; wikipedia notes, "sample" or "model" implementation are less
&gt; frequently used terms for the same thing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There are some conformance tests, and I can see a lot of value in keeping
&gt; them next to the spec and "sample implementation", I'm generally a fan of
&gt; starting with a mono repo and splitting things up when it becomes obvious
&gt; that it is the right thing to do because there is too much contribution for
&gt; one repo to handle, or because sub components are getting consumed
&gt; independently almost as frequently as they are getting consumed together.
&gt;
&gt; If there is reason to believe there will be more contribution overall if
&gt; the "sample implementation" is also in W3C CCG repos, I'm happy to do
&gt; that... I saw splitting them up as a potential opportunity to
&gt; engage multiple communities and AFAIK you can contribute to Apache 2.0
&gt; software regardless of the github organization that hosts it, for example:
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-dsw-reference">https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-dsw-reference</a>

&gt; also Apache 2.0 with a CLA...
&gt;
&gt; Leonard, should I interpret your strong desire that "an example
&gt; implementation" stay in CCG as an indication of a strong desire / plan to
&gt; contribute to it here?

         I had never looked at the Wikipedia definition – but I would agree completely with that definition.    And it also goes towards why I don’t believe that you’d end up with a “reference implementation” – mostly because of #2 and #4.

For some definition of “contribute” – yes.

Does W3C specifically discourage the use of the term "reference implementation".... I assumed this was a common practice: <a href="https://github.com/webofthings/webofthings.js">https://github.com/webofthings/webofthings.js</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebofthings%2Fwebofthings.js&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C3e1490699ab7494574d908d8189b7dd5%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637286403399378226&amp;sdata=01gF8L3pFl%2FB">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebofthings%2Fwebofthings.js&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C3e1490699ab7494574d908d8189b7dd5%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637286403399378226&amp;sdata=01gF8L3pFl%2FB</a>2AFAVFYWDJgiHUSQmphCcId8X31MFRs%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt;

Regardless of the name, these are the characteristics I'm looking for. As wikipedia notes, "sample" or "model" implementation are less frequently used terms for the same thing.

There are some conformance tests, and I can see a lot of value in keeping them next to the spec and "sample implementation", I'm generally a fan of starting with a mono repo and splitting things up when it becomes obvious that it is the right thing to do because there is too much contribution for one repo to handle, or because sub components are getting consumed independently almost as frequently as they are getting consumed together.

If there is reason to believe there will be more contribution overall if the "sample implementation" is also in W3C CCG repos, I'm happy to do that... I saw splitting them up as a potential opportunity to engage multiple communities and AFAIK you can contribute to Apache 2.0 software regardless of the github organization that hosts it, for example: <a href="https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-dsw-reference">https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-dsw-reference</a>&lt;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fadobe%2Fexperience-platform-dsw-reference&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C3e1490699ab7494574d908d8189b7dd5%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637286403399388230&amp;sdata=S">https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fadobe%2Fexperience-platform-dsw-reference&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clrosenth%40adobe.com%7C3e1490699ab7494574d908d8189b7dd5%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637286403399388230&amp;sdata=S</a>2LwBiCJCVdRe9UA%2FG2IcgMFBmkvoZNYuui%2Bigltahw%3D&amp;reserved=0&gt; is also Apache 2.0 with a CLA...

Example implementation is probably best.

    &gt; We have no strong opinion on hosting an implementation at DIF as long as

         This is great work Orie,
 I think having a code base that implements the specification and stays
aligned is a good idea.
 I think it would be great to see example/reference implementations in

&gt; independently almost as frequently as they are getting consumed together.
&gt;
&gt; If there is reason to believe there will be more contribution overall if
&gt; the "sample implementation" is also in W3C CCG repos, I'm happy to do
&gt; that... I saw splitting them up as a potential opportunity to
&gt; engage multiple communities and AFAIK you can contribute to Apache 2.0

<p>To build Canada’s digital future, every Canadian needs a seat at the table. DIACC is fortunate to have members from both the public and private sectors, all of whom are working together at the forefront of digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re connecting with DIACC member Women in Identity to learn how they have navigated industry challenges and get career advice for the next generation. In this article, we hear perspectives from British Columbia (BC) to New Brunswick and in between. These are some of the leaders who are shaping service delivery for Canadians, and driving change across the industry.</p>



<p>Molding Young Minds&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a gender divide within the tech sector – in Canada and beyond. How can we encourage more young women to pursue these careers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>More emphasis on competencies required rather than the technical infrastructure could help, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-howse-2090761a/?originalSubdomain=ca">Sophia Howse</a>, Executive Director, BC’s Provincial Identity Information Management Program with the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/bc-bid-resources/goods-and-services-catalogue/provincial-idim-program?keyword=IDIM">Province of BC</a>, explained. “If we could communicate how skills such as leadership, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving can be applied in the space, then I feel we would attract more interest from women.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjritchie/">CJ Ritchie</a>, Associate Deputy Minister and Government Chief Information Officer for the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home">Province of BC</a>, and member of the DIACC <a href="https://diacc.ca/the-diacc/directors/">Board of Directors</a>, noted that it’s important to adapt leadership styles to industry contexts and to individual team members. “Mature leaders don’t try to manage everybody or manage everybody the same. Make room for specificity and diversity and bring on a team that’s smarter than you. Don’t be afraid to not be the smartest person in the room – it’s a sign you’re doing it right.”</p>



<blockquote><p> “Make room for specificity and diversity and bring on a team that’s smarter than you. Don’t be afraid to not be the smartest person in the room – it’s a sign you’re doing it right.”</p>CJ Ritchie, Associate Deputy Minister and Government Chief Information Officer for the Province of BC</blockquote>



<p>Sharing sector opportunities with young women during school years is key, emphasized <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-boldon-47732a12/">Colleen Boldon</a>, Director, Digital Lab and Digital ID Programs, Public Services and Smart Government at <a href="https://www2.snb.ca/content/snb/en.html">Service New Brunswick</a>, and member of the DIACC Board of Directors. “Women need mentors, career advancement opportunities and meaningful work,” she said. “I think the one distinction that still exists today is that men more often ask for help and advancement opportunities, while women are more inclined to try to do things on their own, take another course and hope that someone notices their work and promotes them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kathleen Fraser, Manager of Digital Identity for <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/home">Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada</a>, echoed the need for a broader view of what it means to work in tech that demonstrates the difference it can make in the lives of Canadians. She explained, “For myself, I take great pride in the work I do because I feel a great desire to make a difference in people’s lives and for the clients who are interacting with us.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“Saying ‘yes’ to complex assignments and being comfortable in the ‘not knowing’ space offers a challenging work environment that can pave the way to a very challenging and rewarding career”</p>Sophia Howse, Executive Director, BC’s Provincial Identity Information Management Program with the Province of BC</blockquote>



<p>Women Encouraging Women</p>



<p>Technology doesn’t have to be intimidating or highly technical, pointed out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cosanna/">Cosanna Preston-Idedia</a>, Director of Digital Identity for the <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/">Government of Saskatchewan</a>. “Whoever you are, dig into your passions and spend time understanding how tech is impacting, shaping and changing that space,” she said. “If the actual technical details are not for you, look to the concepts, outcomes and impacts that it has to offer.”</p>



<p>To help other women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations, she emphasized taking time to lift others up. This could involve concluding meetings with a roundtable discussion, serving as a mentor or coach, and offering public praise and private feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Whoever you are, dig into your passions and spend time understanding how tech is impacting, shaping and changing that space.” </p> Cosanna Preston-Idedia, Director of Digital Identity for the Government of Saskatchewan. </blockquote>



<p>Drawing inspiration from her own mentors, Fraser believes a growth mindset and community as essential for success. “Never stop learning and build a network of people with a similar vision,” she said. “The kind of work we’re doing right now cannot be done in a silo. It has to be done in collaboration with other people.”</p>



<p>Howse advises becoming more comfortable with the unknown. “I have learned that saying ‘yes’ to complex assignments and being comfortable in the ‘not knowing’ space offers a challenging work environment that can pave the way to a very challenging and rewarding career,” she said. For instance, encouraging team members to present their work to a larger audience boosts confidence and builds profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Ritchie’s experience, understanding how to attenuate her leadership style to the culture she found herself in became a source of strength. “It was a turning point learning to use that to my advantage rather than letting it be a barrier to me,” she explained. Differences in how she was perceived in new roles and industries became less personal. “Learning that that was an external force that had nothing to do with me and attenuating my style to have a better impact on my reputation and corporate currency,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“For myself, I take great pride in the work I do because I feel a great desire to make a difference in people’s lives and for the clients who are interacting with us.”</p>Kathleen Fraser, Manager of Digital Identity for Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada,</blockquote>



<p>Challenges and the Road Ahead</p>



<p>“There are more CEOs today named John than there are female CEOs. That should tell you something,” Ritchie reflected on the state of the landscape. “Snapshots in time can fool you into thinking we’ve made progress – but I’m not sure that’s true.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get ahead and persevere, even when often one of the only women in the room, Fraser focuses on the huge potential for change. “I think you need to have passion and a sense of leadership that allows you to be a disruptor,” she explains. “That is what we’re doing – we’re disruptors in the space when we look at new ways of doing things. When you have conviction in your vision… you don’t stop at the first sign of failure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boldon chooses to focus on the things she can control – her work and the challenge ahead.&nbsp;”My story looks very similar to other woman who chose non-traditional careers for our generation, and experienced discrimination and setbacks, while pushing career and societal boundaries on what a good wife and mother should be,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her advice? “Enjoy the ride. There are more opportunities for women in IT [Information Technology] than ever before and it is an ever-evolving, fascinating sector where you can find meaningful work, wonderful colleagues and a great career.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“Enjoy the ride.

<p>Do not fear the words technical or technology, added Howse. Understand your skillset and lean into your strengths, all while continuing to develop yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ritchie agrees that diving in and going for your goals is important, especially as women are more likely to limit themselves to roles and opportunities they believe they are 100 per cent qualified for. “Don’t feel you need to have it all figured out,” she shared. “You can build the bridge as you walk on it. You only need to know the next right step to take… You’re capable of far more than you think.”</p>



<p>Meet more leading <a href="https://diacc.ca/2020/03/06/diacc-women-in-digital-identity/">female DIACC members in digital identity</a>!&nbsp; </p>

         Hi!  Is there likewise a storage call tomorrow for June 25th?
What's the agenda?

I'd presume we want to talk about layers from two directions:
 - use cases: top down
 - technical: bottom up

Likewise, we hope to have more to talk about in terms of Datashards and
this group, it would be great if we could discuss those developments at
this meeting.

this group, it would be great if we could discuss those developments at
this meeting.

To address Anil's questions,

If PKI credentials can be represented as JSON / Binary Data Model, and we
can model the process of "Deriving Credentials by Proof of Possession" as
an abstract process whereby the the Data Model components are used to
produce a "Derived PIV Credential", the answer is yes.

The spec in its current form allows for the modeling of a cryptographic
key, that might be hardware, software isolated or remote in the case of web
kms, it's perfectly capable of modeling the signing of a newly generated
key, by a hardware isolated one (I believe this is approximately what is
happening with derived PIV credentials).

The PIV Card may need to be present later on down the line (say after the
user has transferred wallet contents 2 or 3 times). As long as the current
wallet provider supports the PIV Card interface (over NFC or via a card
reader), the portability of wallet contents is achieved, and its possible
to use the PIV Card, as you would any other WebAuthN Authenticator, to
maintain presentation capabilities associated with wallet contents.

A similar example in the crypto currency world is with hardware isolated
key in the form of ledgers or trezors.... the wallet representation of
these simple stored metadata about them, and as long as they have not been
hit with a hammer, they can be connected to wallet software that supports
the "wallet spec" and used to transfer currency, even if the wallet content
had been transferred a few times since they were first registered.... this
is because the data model described them in an abstract form which is
relatively safe to export and import, because the hardware device is still
required to leverage the associated capabilities.

&gt;
&gt; With the heavy use of mobile devices a reality, the USG some time ago
&gt; implemented something that is termed a “Derived Personal Identity

&gt; <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-157/final">https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-157/final</a> ) which is a

&gt; As an FYI, the Technical Topic Area #3 of our current open solicitation

&gt; infrastructure that could support DIDs/VCs as well as Derived Credentials,

&gt; implement and fully interoperable interfaces to the Issuer, Verifier and
&gt; any type of a Resilient Registry Infrastructure.

&gt; *Subject:* New Work Item Proposal: Universal Wallet 2020
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm writing this list to propose a new W3C CCG Work Item
&gt; "universal-wallet-2020":
&gt;
&gt; Repo: <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet</a>
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNbbje3ux">https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNbbje3ux</a>$&gt;
&gt; Spec: <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/">https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/</a>
&gt; &lt;<a href="https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNRzsU4h2">https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNRzsU4h2</a>$&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The proposed specification will define a data model and
&gt; abstract interfaces for digital wallets that store currency, credentials,
&gt; key material or references to key material, meta data, and cards... The
&gt; goal being to help unify DIDs, VCs,  and cryptocurrency wallet data models,
&gt; by defining missing vocabulary or defining relationships between existing
&gt; vocabulary, reusing existing specifications as much as possible without
&gt; modification.... Including DIDs, DID Key, VCs, VC HTTP APIs, WebKMS, VP
&gt; Request Spec, Presentation Exchange, etc...
&gt;
&gt; We're not proposing anyone change any of their existing wallets. We're
&gt; proposing a specification describing a way for them to import and export
&gt; wallet contents according to a data model, and to disclose support for a
&gt; set of abstract interfaces, as a way of enabling users to tell what
&gt; features a given wallet supports (currency, identity, and/or credentials).
&gt; We cannot move, what we don't understand, or that has no common
&gt; portability format.
&gt;
&gt; We've presented this work to the CCG, DIF and Aries WG, and gotten
&gt; positive feedback, but also some concern about scope / informative vs
&gt; normative statements for interfaces. We're also tracking compatibility with
&gt; Indy Wallets and Secure Data Stores... and we're working to understand how
&gt; to represent data structures like connections or indy credential schemas in
&gt; ways that support portability and interoperability.
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to continue this discussion and modify the spec in the W3C CCG
&gt; with participation from the community.
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to move the current reference implementation to the DIF at the
&gt; same time, but we're open to keeping them co-located if thats desired, we
&gt; want to be sensitive to companies that cannot (or don't desire to) commit
&gt; to the reference implementation but wish to develop the spec.
&gt;
&gt; Happy to answer any questions!
&gt;
&gt; We're looking for additional organizations to co-edit / sponsor the
&gt; development of the specification in the W3C CCG.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;

Subject: New Work Item Proposal: Universal Wallet 2020

Hi All,

I'm writing this list to propose a new W3C CCG Work Item "universal-wallet-2020":

Repo: <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet</a>&lt;<a href="https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNbbje3ux">https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNbbje3ux</a>$&gt;
Spec: <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/">https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/</a>&lt;<a href="https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNRzsU4h2">https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!S4BxVQn949xifVocIoP6XNV9Dvimv8hbHVFYvZfzbWnZbhdyj2CeDpGkbtPCNRzsU4h2</a>$&gt;

The proposed specification will define a data model and abstract interfaces for digital wallets that store currency, credentials, key material or references to key material, meta data, and cards... The goal being to help unify DIDs, VCs,  and cryptocurrency wallet data models, by defining missing vocabulary or defining relationships between existing vocabulary, reusing existing specifications as much as possible without modification.... Including DIDs, DID Key, VCs, VC HTTP APIs, WebKMS, VP Request Spec, Presentation Exchange, etc...

We're not proposing anyone change any of their existing wallets. We're proposing a specification describing a way for them to import and export wallet contents according to a data model, and to disclose support for a set of abstract interfaces, as a way of enabling users to tell what features a given wallet supports (currency, identity, and/or credentials). We cannot move, what we don't understand, or that has no common portability format.

We've presented this work to the CCG, DIF and Aries WG, and gotten positive feedback, but also some concern about scope / informative vs normative statements for interfaces. We're also tracking compatibility with Indy Wallets and Secure Data Stores... and we're working to understand how to represent data structures like connections or indy credential schemas in ways that support portability and interoperability.

We'd like to continue this discussion and modify the spec in the W3C CCG with participation from the community.

We'd like to move the current reference implementation to the DIF at the same time, but we're open to keeping them co-located if thats desired, we want to be sensitive to companies that cannot (or don't desire to) commit to the reference implementation but wish to develop the spec.

Happy to answer any questions!

We're looking for additional organizations to co-edit / sponsor the development of the specification in the W3C CCG.

Regards,

OS

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Jim Sullivan of <a href="https://blockchain.dcwebmakers.com/">DC Web Makers</a>.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?</p>



<p>Blockchain is the Internet of Value as opposed to today’s Internet of Information. Building blockchain applications is no different from any other application. Regard blockchain applications as transaction applications. Blockchain applications permanently record asset transfer and asset ownership.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on, and let us know what was it that made you want to get into blockchain?</p>



<p>In my work as a software engineer, I have had the opportunity to see how blockchain can rewrite rules for everyday interactions. For example, in the not too distant future, we will use blockchain to manage cellular numbers. Cellular numbers are assets, and similar to any other asset, these numbers can be modeled on a blockchain. Blockchain will allow cellular, and all phone,&nbsp; numbers to be more easily and securely managed, and less subject to fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What project in Hyperledger are you working on? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>We are building an application for a cross-border secure supply chain. The Hyperledger channels provide suppliers a path for interacting with the end customer, while ensuring that their data is only visible to the end customer. The channels ensure that no supplier’s data is visible to the other suppliers.</p>



<p>What are the main differences between developing blockchain applications in Hyperledger or Ethereum?</p>



<p>While working at <a href="https://dcwebmakers.com/">DC Web Makers</a>, I often have to follow a client’s requirements especially their blockchain platform choice for development. However, I personally enjoy writing codes for both Hyperledger and Ethereum platforms. My favorite Hyperledger framework is&nbsp;Hyperledger Fabric and my favorite Ethereum framework and tool are Remix and the Truffle Suite. There is no doubt about it.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>The most important thing Hyperledger can focus on is increasing the number of transactions per second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s incubated projects start maturing and hit 1.0s and beyond, what are the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result from your perspective?</p>



<p>Hyperledger Transact is a really interesting product. We need methods for quickly creating distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>Blockchain is going to solve many problems. However, I am looking forward to seeing blockchain secure the supply chain. This will add to the quality of products and make products safer. This will enhance the quality of life for all people, everywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in 5 years?</p>



<p>We hope to see robust widely accepted Hyperledger DLT applications. We need to see the number of transactions per second increase to compete against other financial systems.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Use the Scrum process, or a variation, and demo work back to the customer.</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>The Internet.</p>

 DIF F2F Virtual community meeting — Follow up, 6/16/2020  Highlights, videos, and&nbsp;links <p>To the 100+ attendees who came, thank you for joining us at the DIF F2F Virtual Community meeting last week. For everyone else reading this, thank you as well, and we hope that if you find something interesting below, you’ll feel welcome to our future events, working groups, and conversations.</p>Highlights, videos and links from the DIF Virtual Face-to-Face, 6/16/2020<p>🎉 During the 5+ hours, we spent together over zoom, we discussed ethics, technology, community, and collaboration. We heard from current DIF members, newcomers to the decentralized identity space, and DIF-curious veterans curious what our working groups have been up to. Particularly well-attended were the community-wide interoperability session and the solid three hours of working group introductions and updated, chock full of wide-ranging Q&amp;A and even a few announcements about projects soon to be open-sourced!</p><p>📝 This update condenses the essential takeaways and announcements from each session of the meeting, as well as listing links shared in chat and links to video recordings of the entire session. Before jumping in, let us announce two on-ramps to future discussions:</p><blockquote>here is a <a href="https://bit.ly/DIF-interop-kickoff">sign up form</a> for our open call for cross-community interoperability coordination, taking place June 26th at 12 ET,&nbsp;and</blockquote><blockquote>here is another <a href="https://bit.ly/DIF-bi-weekly-signup">sign-up form</a> for the hourlong sync meetings, also open to the public, that we hold every other Wednesday at 11&nbsp;ET.</blockquote> ☕Welcome remarks <p>We started off bright and early at 8 am for the Pacific time zones of California, Vancouver and Washington with a little icebreaker exercise: everyone willing to do so marked themselves on a public google <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1eHwfd0pvpFz91BZaURjcMYiOdWvGhv21&amp;ll=9.984318391738466%2C25.884586828842203&amp;z=3">map</a> while many newcomers introduced themselves over Zoom and chat. After that, executive director Rouven Heck gave some opening remarks and there was a brief housekeeping Q&amp;A&nbsp;session.</p>Map of F2F community<p>From chat:</p>  DHS S&amp;T SVIP Call — <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jun/0064.html">CFP</a>  W3C CCG <a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-http-api/">work item</a> to standardize on HTTP APIs (this extends the API standardization for the DHS SVIP <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/tree/master/plugfest-2020">plugfest</a>; see also <a href="https://did.actor/">did:actor</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>)  About the controversial comments around ION project (Coindesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-releases-bitcoin-based-id-tool-as-covid-19-passports-draw-criticism">hit&nbsp;piece</a>)  A <a href="https://hieofone.com/">project</a> introduction from Adrian in healthcare use-cases, privacy issues, and&nbsp;ethics   📓Code of&nbsp;Conduct <p>approved version: on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">github</a></p><p>Between #IIW29 and #IIW30, a DIF ad hoc committee worked weekly to define and iterate a new Code of Conduct for DIF working groups, mailing lists, GitHub repos, and events.

We also outlined a new DIF initiative taking shape to offer <a href="https://forms.gle/epJyaqu9ecaqXPPT9">workshops</a> for people interested in cultivating responsive and empathetic convening skills and conflict resolution skills application to contexts like ours. Creating an open, healthy, and productive culture where members and the community can build and grow together is an important part of any organization, and we are putting money and time behind our commitment to making that the case here at&nbsp;DIF.</p><p>Please submit pull requests on <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">github</a> or leave marginal comments in the approved draft Google <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlsG20L2mkb22KKZl-3DEid5n5bkLVGYB3CagjDclW0/edit">doc</a>, as this is a living document which will be iterated again before the next face-to-face meeting.</p> ☂️Interoperability WG — Cross Community effort <p>This session proposed pivoting the existing DIF Interoperability Project to a more coordinating and project-managing paradigm. Previously, the project primary work has been building and adopting testing infrastructure, but while that work is important and much of it will still be done in other DIF WGs, the new interoperability working group charter is scoped to only for identifying roadblocks to and gaps in a widely-interoperable decentralized identity stack. Once identified, these needs will be analyzed consultatively to avoid redundant work and route them to the best (and most collaborative) working context, in or outside of&nbsp;DIF.</p><p>The meetings of this group will be a fully open, non-IPR protected meeting so all parties with skin in the game are warmly welcomed to attend, to listen in, or to watch the recording afterward. A (draft) charter can be seen here for scope: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a01GQVtZB7tDVcm9avS8zuYPHQzEEDtTOEh4Bqu-8Bs/edit">Interop WG</a> and the inaugural Community kick-off meeting will take place on June 26th at 9 am PST / 12 pm ET / 6 pm CET.

This ongoing effort seeks to gather and analyze real-world credentials data dictionaries so as to create guidance for newcomers to the space on harmonization, semantic discovery and interoperability. Out of this evolved the Credential Presentation work item, which was a kind of minimalist or lightweight specification for a widely-interoperable credential exchange, done in parallel to DIDComm, for an overlapping but different set of cross-platform wallet-to-wallet use cases. Wayne also mentioned three work items happening primarily outside of DIF for now that C&amp;C is watching closely with an eye to aligning or contributing were appropriate:</p>  Mattr Global’s BBS+/ZKP-LD <a href="https://mattr.global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials/">prototypes</a> to make upcoming Ursa cryptography universally accessible via&nbsp;JSON-LD  Mattr Global’s <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec">client-bound assertions</a>, a proposal for aligning emerging OIDC standards with the SSI world’s credential exchange requirements  Transmute’s Universal Wallet 2020 <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet">project</a>, an attempt at specifying a minimal protocol for wallets that might simplify the addition of VC storage and wallet-to-wallet communications to cryptocurrency wallets, the addition of cryptocurrency to SSI wallets, and most promising of all, the linking (or “correlation,” for now!) of the two kinds of functions of such a joint&nbsp;wallet.  <p>Sam Curren introduced the DIDComm working group, which works on the wallet-to-wallet communication protocol at the core of the Hyperledger Aries project in a somewhat narrower, focused-scope way while staying in dialogue with the larger Aries vision of DIDComm. Sam gave updates on two recent milestones of which DIF is particularly proud: the group reached a v1 specification of the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM envelope</a> and submitted it to IETF so it could be approved while other parts of the specification continued in parallel. Also, the group moved to ECDH-1PU signature suites for greater acceptance and alignment with contemporary IETF recommendations. Sam also reported on some [deeply technical] topics that have been the focus of most DIDComm discussion and progress since the last semi-annual DIF meeting: repudiable-by-default signature design, a core set of four transport modalities (including qR codes), key type support, and most recently, rotation-on-first-use capabilities and “upgrading” of ephemeral keys.</p><p>From chat:</p>  C&amp;C WG <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/DIF-Claims-Credentials-Taxonomy-5a27256042984acf9b0633e0d7ec7b86">notion&nbsp;page</a>  DIDComm meeting <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpTm5SmgfOJcEsXfizO0ZmH1r7imTJDGKudAZtYsm0M/edit#">agendas</a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging">repo</a>  Dmitri: Digital Bazaar is working on <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/qram">another QR code communication project</a>  Gabe: You can always use Workday’s cred-exch <a href="https://github.com/workdaycredentials/specifications/blob/master/specifications/claim-proof.md">stuff</a>&nbsp;:)  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">Repo</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">Reference implementation</a> of BBS+ JSONLD; also a <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">Reference implementation</a> of just the signature suite   Closing Circle <p>The meeting ended with a heartfelt thanks from the organizers, steering committee members, and Executive Director Rouven Heck.

&gt; WHAT IS IT?
&gt; This is basically the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) process which covers Verified Credentials (VC) spec maintenance for VCWG (Verified Credentials Working Group). The VCWG finished the 1.0 spec and is now only responsible for maintenance. Any new changes to the VC spec should come through the CCG as a PR (pull-request), which will then be sent to the VCWG. Then the PR will be reviewed by the VCWG for IPR requirements and if passes be added as a maintenance change.

&gt; Thank you to Manu and Dan B. for this draft.

&gt; - Link to the document:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpmxkY0mefzZf47GXNM0qC83lBEhyaRSBmf4NJpaa6M/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpmxkY0mefzZf47GXNM0qC83lBEhyaRSBmf4NJpaa6M/edit</a>

I have provided some replies to the comments in that document.

One more practical note that is worth noting (for those who have not yet participated similar activities). If anyone makes a PR to the repository (ie, a proposed change on the Model specification) then an add-on to github will automatically do an IPR check.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the submitter is an official member of the VC Working Group, then the system will recognize this and the submission will be accepted as part of the IPR disclosure mechanism in place for the Working Group participants. Otherwise, the PR will be temporarily blocked and the submitter will be asked to make some IPR declaration (the modalities will depend on whether he/she represents a W3C Member organization or not).

The check can be shortcut (essentially switched off) by the WG’s staff contact (ie, yours truly) if the PR is non-substantial, meaning that it does not affect any normative statement (which is something the document editors should tell me, it is not my decision).

To avoid complications, two good practice steps:

• The submitter should have his/her W3C account “bound” to the github account (go to [1], and look for ‘connected accounts’ on the left column). It is a good idea for everyone to just make that connection once and for all (and forget about it:-)
• The best is if substantial PR-s are submitted by genuine WG members...

I continue to believe that explaining “the problem” as a relationship problem between Me’s and B’s is excellent, and uniquely insightful, and that it can be used as a “wedge” to identify companies and products that do “the right thing” for their customers vs those that have other goals in mind, with the goal of transforming this multi-(m/b/tr)illion market. This is a very worth-while activity and the world will be better off if/when it succeeds.<br><br>Now that Me2B Alliance is focusing on putting its first product out, and working on putting itself on a long-term sustainable financial foundation, I believe it is time to build a different board of directors who are committed to the organization to the next level and thus I am stepping down.<br><br>I wish the Alliance, and its mission, all the success, and obviously I won’t disappear from the community.

LOL. I always make that "mistake". In my head, it's always Verified
Credentials despite losing that battle on this very list years ago.
Interchangeable IMO. I'm sure y'all will attempt to correct me on this
matter again in the future. ;-)

&gt;

One quick correction for the benefit of those who might not have been very
involved in this work:  it's "Verifiable Credentials", not "Verified
Credentials". There is an important semantic distinction between those two
phrases.

should come through the CCG as a PR (pull-request), which will then be sent
&gt; to the VCWG. Then the PR will be reviewed by the VCWG for IPR requirements
&gt; and if passes be added as a maintenance change.
&gt;

The VCWG will also verify that the changes stay within the scope of the
charter for the VC work.

Subject: DHS S&amp;T SVIP Call (Re-Release) || Blockchain/DLT/SSI Solutions to Prevent Forgery &amp; Counterfeiting of Certificates and Licenses

Hello Everyone,
We have re-opened the DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) Call for Blockchain/DLT/SSI solutions i.e. Funding Opportunity for Startups, with additional problem sets that are being faced by our Operational Components and Programs.
This work will be both separate (different problem sets &amp; in one case a different problem sponsor) and similar (we are building on top of, and doubling down on, the very real standards based interoperability work that has already been accomplished and demonstrated by the original cohort of companies that we awarded contracts to).
While members of the original cohort that remain part of the program will continue to focus on their product build out in Phase 2, we are seeking additional companies to address additional problem sets. To find out more, please take a look at the details below and our full solicitation.
As an FYI, the Virtual Industry Day is an opportunity to get your questions (both business and technical) answered, before you decide whether or not to apply to the program.
We hope that you will consider working with us to enable an ecosystem that contains a pluralism of operators and technologies, is truly interoperable and diverse, and prevents technology and vendor lock-in.
Best Regards,

Anil

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), on behalf of DHS Operational Components and Programs, invests in startup companies from across the nation and around the world to adapt, develop and harness cutting-edge capabilities that are commercially sustainable while simultaneously meeting the needs of DHS.
[cid:image006.jpg@01D63E98.C8791D60]
Decentralized and distributed registry and time-stamping implementations such as Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), from a government perspective, holds the potential for enhanced transparency and auditing of public service operations, greater visibility into multi-party business operations, and automation of paper-based processes to improve delivery of services to organizations and citizens.
DHS Operational Components and Programs,  such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the DHS Privacy Office (PRIV) have common needs across their mission sets for the use of interoperable implementations of these technologies that also support the growth and availability of a competitive marketplace of diverse technology implementations for government and industry to draw upon to deliver cost effective and innovative solutions.
This SVIP Call i.e. Product Development Funding Opportunity for Startup Companies, is seeking solutions that apply decentralized identifiers and resilient registries to the issuance and verification of identifiers and credentials in order to enhance their security, while employing privacy respecting mechanisms that implement standards based multi-platform interoperability.
It reflects the needs of DHS Operational Components and Programs, with applicants expected to use one or more of following DHS specific scenarios to frame their applications:

  *   Alternative Identifier to the Social Security Number (PRIV)
  *   Food Supply Chain Safety and Visibility (CBP)
  *   Supply Chain Traceability of Natural Gas Imports (CBP)
  *   Supply Chain Traceability of Direct-to-Consumer E-Commerce Shipments (CBP)
  *   Privacy Respecting Essential Work and/or Task License (USCIS)
Register to attend the virtual SVIP Industry Day on June 23, 2020 to hear details regarding the Business, Technical and Program aspects of this Call, and to have your questions answered by SVIP, CBP, PRIV and USCIS Representatives.
